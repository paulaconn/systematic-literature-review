"Consideration of Improvement in the Educational Activities Using Web-Based Computational Science Platform","G. M. Ryu; J. H. Shin; J. C. Lee; S. Lee; K. W. Cho","","2017 IEEE 13th International Conference on e-Science (e-Science)","20171116","2017","","","467","468","Numerous computational science platforms, including EDISON, have broken the previous education focused on theory and providing practical and experiential educational services with various simulation tools and educational contents. This paper analyzed the effectiveness and usability through a survey of university e-lectures and educational competitions using EDISON for better service improvement. In this survey six disciplines were chosen: computational fluid dynamics, nano-electronic device and general physics, computational chemistry, structural analysis, computer aided optimal design, computational bio-medicine. Interestingly, according to the results of the survey, users of each computational science field were already familiar with the user interfaces of the simulation tools they had used before EDISON, and hoped that EDISON would have similar one. In addition, although the effectiveness of learning has been improved through practice, it is difficult for first learners because of quantitative and qualitative shortage of user and theory manuals. Lastly, the most important factor was the lecturer's explanation to use the computational science platform and find the meaning of the simulation results. To sum up, back-ups which are documentation and lecturer's assistances should be accompanied outside simulation workflows. In the last stage, this study searched for ways to improve the quality through summarizing the requirements, and proposed the direction of EDISON in the future.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2686-3; POD:978-1-5386-2687-0","10.1109/eScience.2017.74","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8109179","EDISON;e-lectures;educational competitions;educational disciplines;web-based computational science platform","Computational modeling;Education;Manuals;Portals;Scientific computing;Tools;User interfaces","","","","","","","","","","24-27 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

From science to the humanities, mathematics and logical thinking ability also affect every aspect of computer science education. To foster mathematics logical thinking and problem-solving ability in primary and secondary schools, students not only require to learn to read, writing, and arithmetic, but also need to understand the abstraction of mathematics operations and logical thinking processes. Therefore, this study uses visual programming language as a basis, i.e. Scratch 2.0 offline edition, to introduce abstraction of mathematics operations. Scratch 2.0 can empower learners using graphical elements to solve mathematics problems with a smooth learning curve through user-friendly programming interface. However, the latest version of Scratch 2.0 does not include enough functions for abstracting mathematical blocks. Consequently, this study integrates Scratch programming environment with math library of Python language to expand functionality and improve usability of Scratch. Moreover, learners are expected to learn and practice more about mathematical thinking through those additional Scratch building blocks.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3438-3; POD:978-1-5090-3439-0","10.1109/ICS.2016.0131","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7858553","Python;Scratch extension;computer science education;mathematics and logical thinking;visual programming language","Computer languages;Computer science education;Mathematics;Programming profession;Visualization","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational institutions;mathematics computing;statistical analysis;teaching;visual programming","Python language;Scratch 2.0 offline edition;Scratch mathematical extensions;Scratch programming environment;computer science education;experimental functionality development;graphical elements;humanities;logical thinking processes;math library;mathematics operation abstraction;primary schools;problem-solving ability;secondary schools;smooth learning curve;statistics extensions;user-friendly programming interface;visual programming language","","","","","","","","15-17 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our in vivo study examines how VEnvI can be used to teach fundamental computer science concepts such as sequences, loops, variables, conditionals, functions, and parallel programming. We aim to reach younger students through a fun and intuitive interface for choreographing dance movements with a virtual character. Our study contrasts the highly immersive and embodied virtual reality metaphor of using VEnvI with a non-immersive desktop metaphor. Additionally, we examine the effects of user attachment by comparing the learning results gained with customizable virtual characters in contrast with character presets.

"PBLMaestro: A virtual learning environment for the implementation of problem-based learning approach in Computer education","F. S. de Oliveira; S.

Within this scenario, a practical and dynamic learning system is being fostered that allows simulations to be carried out in real contexts through problem resolution. Based on constructivist theories, PBL (Problem-Based Learning) is a teaching method that is focused on the students and its main characteristic is that it uses real-world problems to create the learning content and teach the skills required for their solution. However, the adoption of this approach is not an easy task, since it is accompanied by abrupt changes in the traditional paradigm of education, which require changes in the attitudes of the actors involved. In addition, the planning and monitoring of the PBL, involve complex activities that are difficult to manage, especially with regard to determining the quality and compliance of the processes used for problem resolution. Additionally, the Computer Science courses require working on projects provided by real clients, within a dynamic and iterative development process. This strengthens the need to introduce strategies and technologies to support the implementation and management of the method and, enable its effectiveness to be monitored In addition, it provides continuous feedback, and assesses the results generated from the evaluation of the solutions produced during the teaching-learning process. Thus, it is essential to adopt strategies that allow a better management of teaching practice, improved learning by the students and a means of validating the clients involved. From this perspective, this paper presents a virtual teaching and learning environment, called PBLMaestro, which has been designed to support the workflow of a methodology for the implementation of PBL in teaching Computer Science, called xPBL. With the aid of xPBL, it is possible to perform the management of courses using the dy- amics of a cycle and series of stages to allow a better control of management processes, by linking real problems to well-defined educational goals. In the case of teacher planning, we were used elements described in xPBL methodology, aligned with educational goals defined from the Bloom Revised Taxonomy. With regard to student tracking, we used the authentic assessment model and mechanisms of Learning Analytics. Gamification strategies were included to increase engagement, retention and motivation, and push notification messages were displayed in a mobile application the PBLMaestro was validated by means of application the environment in the context of the discipline âNetwork Designâ of Computer Science Course, and the results are analyzed in this study. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the teachers and there was a high degree of satisfaction among the tutors, students and customers who used the service, with regard to the usability and consistency of the proposed environment as well as with its improvements and changes. Although the environment was improved in the area of computer science, it is possible that it can provide support to the STEM context with some customizations.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1790-4; POD:978-1-5090-1791-1","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757388","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757388","Computer Science;Gamification;PBLMaestro;Problem-Based Learning;Virtual Learning Environment","Collaboration;Computational modeling;Computer science;Context;Education;Monitoring;Planning","STEM;computer aided instruction;computer science education;data analysis;educational courses;serious games (computing)","Bloom revised taxonomy;PBLMaestro;STEM context;business corporations;computer education;computer science course;computer science courses;continuous feedback;dynamic learning system;educational goals;educational model;gamification strategies;iterative development process;learning analytics;learning content;market practices;network design;problem resolution;problem-based learning approach;teaching method;teaching-learning process;virtual learning environment;virtual teaching;xPBL","","","","","","","","12-15 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Gradual structuring: Evolving the spreadsheet paradigm for expressiveness and learnability","G. Miller; F. Hermans; R. Braun","School of Computing and Communications, University of Technology Sydney","2016 15th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training (ITHET)","20161201","2016","","","1","8","Spreadsheets are arguably the most used form of programming and are frequently used in higher education to teach fundamental concepts about computation. Their success has shown that they are simple enough for a huge number of end users to learn and use. This is in contrast to traditional programming languages and the high dropout rate from introductory programming and computer science. However in comparison to traditional programming languages and structured modelling, spreadsheets are not expressive, placing a limit on the levels of computational thinking that can be taught using the spreadsheet paradigm. This limitation is imposed by the lack of programming language features and abstractions in the paradigm. Furthermore, more advanced spreadsheet features (e.g. array formulae, lookup formulae, R1C1 syntax) can be difficult to learn and use. This paper discusses the idea of adding language features to spreadsheets, enabling the gradual structuring of free-form spreadsheets to more structured models. We propose that this concept is termed Gradual Structuring, and is analogous to the programming language concept of gradual typing. In this analogy, spreadsheets take the place of dynamic programming and structured modelling of static programming. In programming languages, gradual typing allows dynamic programming to be mixed with static programming. It is our contention that dynamic programming is more learnable while static programming is more expressive and abstract. Gradual typing could be used to mitigate the issues in the teaching of traditional programming. Likewise Gradual Structuring can mitigate the conceptual limits that can be taught using current spreadsheets. The key language feature required to enable Gradual Structuring is the ability to logically group cells together so that a single formula can be applied to the grouped cells. This concept, termed cell grouping diminishes and can even eliminate the need for the ubiquitous and error-prone use of copy-p- sted in spreadsheets. Moreover, it makes the structure present in spreadsheet models explicit. Cell grouping requires a cascade of other new languages features. Namely a more expressive referencing style, which in turned requires enabling labels to be moved to the row and column headers, and the hierarchical structuring of these headers. Respectively these language features are termed enhanced referencing and semantic axes. The ongoing research focusses on the usability and learnability of these language features. Spreadsheet applications exist that contain aspects of the features mentioned. However these applications do not enable Gradual Structuring and have taken a mainly technical, not human behavioural, approach to evolving the spreadsheet.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0778-3; POD:978-1-5090-0779-0; USB:978-1-5090-0777-6","10.1109/ITHET.2016.7760759","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7760759","","Computer languages;Dynamic programming;Education;Electronic mail;Programming profession;Semantics","computer aided instruction;computer science education;further education;programming languages;spreadsheet programs;teaching","R1C1 syntax;array formulae;cell grouping;computation;computer science;dynamic programming;free-form spreadsheets;gradual structuring;gradual typing;higher education;introductory programming;language features;learnability;lookup formulae;programming languages;semantic axes;static programming;structured modelling;teaching;usability","","","","","","","","8-10 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of these challenges is, that these protocols require election authorities to perform complex tasks like generating keys in a distributed manner and decrypting votes in a distributed and verifiable manner. Although corresponding key generation and decryption protocols exist, they are not used in real-world elections for several reasons: The few existing implementations of these protocols and their corresponding interfaces are not designed for people with non technical background and thus not suitable for use by most election authorities. In addition, it is difficult to explain the security model of the protocols, but legal provisions generally require transparency. We implemented a smartphone application for election authorities featuring distributed key generation and verifiable distributed decryption of votes. In addition, we prepared education material throughout based on formulated metaphors for election authorities in order to explain the security of the application. We evaluated the usability of the application and understanding of the underlying security model, concluding that the application is usable for non-experts in computer science. While the participants were able to carry out the tasks, it became clear, that they did not have a clear understanding of the underlying security model, despite having viewed our educational material.

Later chapters illustrate more advanced topics, such as the famous DOCTOR program with its simulated psychotherapist and an INSTANT program that enables parents and teachers to create a programming environment for preschool children. A chapter is devoted to the topic of object-oriented programming, a key feature of the Object Logo implementation of Logo.Logo for the Macintosh is written primarily for use with Object Logo, a powerful implementation of the Logo language that greatly enhances its speed, capabilities, and overall usability in education and beyond. The book may also be used with other versions of Logo for the Macintosh.Harold Abelson is Professor of Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He directed the first implementation of Logo for the Apple II, which made Logo widely available on personal computers beginning in 1981. Amanda Abelson, a high-school student, runs a nationwide Internet based multiuser simulation game.","","97802622555","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6279706.pdf&bkn=6267204&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","1993","","","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

However, there are few factors such as time, safety and cost that hold certain experiments in schools from being conducted in the lab. Instruction using computer based training in education using computer supported virtual laboratory has been reported to provide many advantages over other learning techniques. In this paper, we discuss stages involved in the proposed conceptual framework as a guide to develop virtual laboratory for biology (VLab-Bio) which is divided into three phases namely: identifying research problem, design and develop VLab-Bio prototype and usability testing of the prototype. In the first phase we reported results of a preliminary study which shows that âDescribe the application of knowledge on mitosis in cloningâ is the learning objective to be focused as a content in VLab-Bio. In the second phase, we described the process involved in the framework to structure, plan and control the process of developing the VLab-Bio. In the third phase we suggested six items that will be used in the future usability testing. It is hoped that the proposed conceptual framework for developing VLab-Bio prototype will be workable as a guide for developing an educational software such as VLab-Bio.","2155-6822;21556822","Electronic:978-1-4577-0752-0; POD:978-1-4577-0753-7","10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021732","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6021732","Biology education;Information and communication technology;Virtual Laboratory;Virtual learning;virtual environment","Biology;Educational institutions;Laboratories;Prototypes;Usability","biology computing;computer based training;laboratories;virtual reality","VLab-Bio laboratory;biology laboratory;computer based training;computer supported virtual laboratory;educational software;science laboratory;usability testing","","1","","18","","","","17-19 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the two disciplines are practiced almost independently - missing opportunities to collaborate, coordinate and communicate about the overall design - and thereby contributing to system failures. Today, a confluence of several ingredients contribute to these failures: the increasing importance of the user interface (UI) component in the overall system, the independent maturation of the human computer interaction area, and the lack of a cohesive process model to integrate the UI experts usability engineering (UE) development efforts with that of software engineering (SE). This in turn, we believe, is a result of a void in computing curricula: a lack of education and training regarding the importance of communication, collaboration and coordination between the SE and UE processes. In this paper we describe the current approach to teaching SE and UE and its shortcomings. We identify and analyze the barriers and issues involved in developing systems having substantial interactive components.

Proceedings of the","20040226","2004","","","10 pp.","","As the skills that constitute literacy evolve to accommodate digital media, computer science education finds itself in a sorry state. While students are more in need of computational skills than ever, computer science suffers dramatically low retention rates and a declining percentage of women and minorities. Studies of the problem point to the overemphasis in computer science classes on abstraction over application, technical details instead of usability, and the stereotypical view of programmers as loners lacking creativity. In spring 2003, Georgia Institute of Technology trialed a new course, Introduction to Media Computation, which teaches programming and computation in the context of media creation and manipulation. Students implement PhotoShop-style filters and digital video special effects, splice sounds, and search Web pages. The course is open only to noncomputer science and nonengineering majors at Georgia Tech, such as liberal arts, management and architecture students. The course is supported through the use of a Web-based collaboration environment where students actively share and discuss their digital creations. The results have been dramatic. 120 students enrolled, 2/3 female, and only three students withdrew. By the end of the semester, the combined withdrawal, failure and D-grade rate had reached 11.5% - compared to 42.9% in the traditional introductory computer science course. 60% of the students who took media computation reported that they would be interested in taking an advanced version of the course; only 6% reported that they would otherwise be interested in taking more computer science. Results of the trial indicate that media computation motivates and engages an audience that is poorly served by traditional computer science courses.","","POD:0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265259","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265259","","Application software;Computer science;Computer science education;Context;Digital filters;Information filtering;Information filters;Programming profession;Springs;Usability","computer aided instruction;computer science education;multimedia systems","computer science education;digital media motivation;media computation;media creation;media manipulation","","9","","25","","","","5-8 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the existing VR-based system for fire safety education has some shortcomings such as lack of interactivity and high equipment complexity, resulting in low practicability. In order to improve the effect of fire safety education on campus, this paper establishes the model and architecture of fire safety education system based on VR technology. The framework and various elements of fire safety education system are designed and implemented according to the combination of relevant fire safety education theory and VR technology. Finally the prototype version of fire safety education system based on VR technology is built on the HTC VIVE helmet equipment.

The existing CAD system tries to realize a diagnosis process in an automatic way to replace the doctorâs diagnosis work completely, but it is difficult to capture the doctorâs detection and diagnosis needs and goals accurately due to lack of doctorâs experience. Thus, the accuracy is not up to the doctorâs manual diagnosis results, and it is a tedious and cumbersome job to use the system because it requires manual intervention, which leads to the fact that CAD system was difficult to be widely used. This paper analyzes the characteristics of doctorsâ diagnosis tasks deeply, and makes the reasonable allocation of tasks between the doctor and computer. Then the perceptual control theory is introduced into the task model, a PTT task model is proposed to make it express uncertainty of the doctorâs diagnosis tasks, and it can be used as a reference for future uncertainty task analysis. Therefore, an interactive CAD tasks framework is put forward with the assistant decision support provided for doctors by means of Bayesian network model and conceptual graph semantic matching method to diagnose tasks.

"Contextualizing user centered design with agile methods in Ethiopia","D. Teka; Y. Dittrich; M. Kifle","IT Doctoral Program, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","2017 IEEE AFRICON","20171107","2017","","","911","916","User centered design (UCD) provides principles and activities for improving usability. However, traditional UCD methods lack considering the context of users in low income, culturally diverse settings and where Information and Communication Technology (ICT) development is at its infant stage. Software development in low and medium income countries like Ethiopia is characterized by big difference in education and livelihood. Heterogeneous cultures both between different ethnic groups and between rural and urban contexts is another challenge for Ethiopian software development. The paper addresses how to adapt UCD methods and agile development to bridge these heterogeneities. To this end, a multi-case study was implemented, researching two projects in an Ethiopian software company. An action research approach has been complemented by a survey and interviews with other companies. It has resulted in contextualization of UCD practices: personas mediated between rural and urban users and developers. Personas helped also customer representatives as well as product owners to understand users and their requirements and allowed to test releases against persona requirements before deployment. Personas were updated throughout the project based on usability testing and experience from early deployment. Besides personas local IT personnel mediated between the rural users and software developers. Pairwise usability testing is an example for cultural adaptation for discount usability evaluation method that has been tried out. Releasing early version to support personnel and members of the company who are closer to the intended users helped to provide a more adapted version from the start.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2775-4; POD:978-1-5386-2776-1; USB:978-1-5386-2774-7","10.1109/AFRCON.2017.8095603","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8095603","Culture;Discount usability;Local IT personnel;Personas;Scrum;Usability testing;User Centered Design (UCD);Workshops","Companies;Cultural differences;Personnel;Testing;Usability;User centered design","","","","","","","","","","18-20 Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Following a review protocol, articles on mobile English language learning from six major databases (IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, ERIC, SpringerLink, and Wiley Online Library) were reviewed. Applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 133 related articles were identified. The results show that the majority of studies were conducted on application m-learning technologies. Pure mobile applications were the most widely-used applications in the English m-learning context. Meanwhile, concerns regarding quality, usability, integration, financial costs, security and privacy, pedagogical practice, and safety were found to be the main challenges of mobile English language learning. Finally, some recommendations are provided for users, developers/providers, and researchers. The results of this paper can assist users, researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in the education sector to allocate the necessary resources and make plans to mitigate the challenges and facilitate the effective use of mobile English language learning in educational practices.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2749541","University of Malaya&#8217;s Postgraduate Research; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8032487","English language;Mobile learning;blended application;pure mobile application;taxonomy","Databases;Education;Libraries;Mobile applications;Mobile communication;Systematics;Taxonomy","human factors;linguistics;mobile learning","ERIC database;English language acquisition;English m-learning context;IEEE Xplore database;ScienceDirect database;SpringerLink database;Web of Science database;Wiley Online Library database;exclusion criteria;financial cost factor;financial costs;inclusion criteria;integration factor;m-learning;mobile English language learning;pedagogical practice;privacy factor;quality factor;recommendations mobile learning;safety factor;security factor;usability factor","","","","","","OAPA","20170912","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Such courses include Software Life Cycle phases like Requirement gathering/ analysis, Design, Implementation and Testing but not UX design. Thus best of the project fail to generate a product that is usable. This paper presents a case study of minor project course which incorporated UX design in building mobile apps. UX is new technology and little known to instructors at colleges. So students were instructed to learn UX from MOOC on 'UX Design for Mobile Developer's', hosted by Udacity. Also, a workshop by industry expert in UX was conducted. The UX activities specified by MOOC were included as part course assessments. Through the UX design, students identified 3 to 4 user/ mobile device requirements and incorporated them in the implementation. The weightage of marks for UX design is 24%, which increased Design phase weightage to 30%. Finally students were able to launch product, 'KLE Tech STUDio' mobile-app. Attainment of design phase, UX, activities specified by MOOC, implementations are 7.2, 7.82, 6.8 and 7.5 respectively on the scale of 10.

These are based on 3D Multi User Virtual Environment platforms (MUVE), and although they have been used for various innovative educational projects their complex permission systems and large numbers of functions can make their management potentially challenging. It follows that an inadequately managed MULE can be ineffective with respect to intended learning outcomes. The purpose of this research was to determine how management challenges manifest themselves and how to support educators in learning and applying MULE management skills. We utilized the popular OpenSim platform for this study. First, a survey of the need for user support (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${\mathrm{N\,= \,43}}$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""allison-ieq1-2632126.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>) is described.

In particular, we developed two different types of simulations for ARfract, namely a game-based simulation and a non-game simulation to explore how the order of different AR simulations influences the perceived usability, learning experiences, and learning outcomes. For the experiment, 10 dyads were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental conditions: 1) the game-to-non-game condition and 2) the non-game-to-game condition. The results indicate that the learners who experienced the game-based simulation before the non-game simulation performed better than did the other group with the reversed experience order. This paper also reports the usability and learning experience issues regarding the affordances of hybrid AR technologies. The major contribution of this proof-of concept research is that it articulates our understanding of how particular configurations (i.e. order) of the emerging technologies (i.e. hybrid Augmented Reality systems) and its use can lead to different learning outcomes.","1939-1382;19391382","","10.1109/TLT.2017.2750673","National Research Foundation of Korea NRF; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8031019","Augmented Reality;embodied interaction;informal learning;refraction of light;wearable technology","Augmented reality;Education;Electronic mail;Games;Glass;Sequential analysis;Visualization","","","","","","","","","20170911","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

"Optimized Motor Imagery Paradigm Based on Imagining Chinese Characters Writing Movement","Z. Qiu; B. Z. Allison; J. Jin; Y. Zhang; X. Wang; W. Li; A.

The MI-based brain computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide communication for the physically impaired. The performance of MI-based BCI mainly depends on the subject's ability to self-modulate electroencephalogram signals. Proper training can help naive subjects learn to modulate brain activity proficiently. However, training subjects typically involve abstract motor tasks and are time-consuming. Methods: to improve the performance of naive subjects during motor imagery, a novel paradigm was presented that would guide naive subjects to modulate brain activity effectively. In this new paradigm, pictures of the left or right hand were used as cues for subjects to finish the motor imagery task. Fourteen healthy subjects (11 male, aged 22-25 years, and mean 23.6Â±1.16) participated in this study. The task was to imagine writing a Chinese character. Specifically, subjects could imagine hand movements corresponding to the sequence of writing strokes in the Chinese character. This paradigm was meant to find an effective and familiar action for most Chinese people, to provide them with a specific, extensively practiced task and help them modulate brain activity. Results: results showed that the writing task paradigm yielded significantly better performance than the traditional arrow paradigm (p <; 0.001).

However, there is a shortage of electronic design automation (EDA) software tools adaptable to AQFP logic. Such tools are essential for designing large-scale-integration circuits efficiently. Therefore, we have developed a first set of EDA tools that handle cell placement and wiring, written in SKILL, the Cadence scripting language. Our tools also consider the maximum wire length constraint that exists in AQFP logic. First, AQFP logic cells are repositioned via the genetic algorithm to minimize the number of wires that violate the wiring length constraint. Buffers are then automatically inserted as signal repeaters for logic rows where the violations still exist. We then complete the logic wiring of the circuit using the channel routing algorithm. We demonstrate the usability of the EDA tools by designing a 16-bit adder as well as a randomly generated test circuit.","1051-8223;10518223","","10.1109/TASC.2017.2721965","Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S); University of Tokyo in collaboration with Cadence Design Systems, Inc.; VLSI Design and Education Center; 10.13039/501100001667 - Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7964776","Adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP);channel routing;electronic design automation (EDA);genetic algorithm","Clocks;Layout;Logic gates;Routing;Tools;Wires;Wiring","adders;electronic design automation;genetic algorithms;large scale integration;network routing;parametric oscillators","AQFP logic cells;Cadence scripting language;EDA software tool;EDA tool placement;EDA tool routing;SKILL;adder;adiabatic switching operation;cell placement;channel routing algorithm;electronic design automation;energy-efficient superconductor logic;genetic algorithm;large-scale adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron circuits;large-scale-integration circuits;logic wiring;maximum wire length constraint;randomly-generated test circuit;zero static power dissipation","","","","","","","20170630","Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In recent years, augmented reality (AR) technology has become widespread for conducting learning activities using mobile devices. In the literature related to science education, there are limited mobile systems found in which AR technology is used for IBL activities. We have therefore designed a mobile system MAPILS to conduct plant IBL activities using AR technology. Further, two application-related aspects of MSI (Mobile science inquiry) evaluation framework are used. For evaluation purposes, this system was tested with 42 local secondary high school students in order to identify the potential benefits of such technology in science education.

We collected GPS trajectory data from people' daily life on campus and use it as empirical mobility traces to generate decision trees and model trees to predict next venues, arrival times, and user encounter. Mobility regularities are mainly considered in these prediction models, and mobility contexts (e.g., time, location, and speed) act as decision nodes in the classification trees. Experimental results using collected GPS data showed that our system achieves 90% accuracy for predicting a user's next venue using a decision tree algorithm, with minute-level (around 5 min) prediction error for arrival time using the model tree algorithm.

Turn-taking temporal evolution in a dyadic conversation is inevitable and can be incorporated into a modeling framework for characterizing and recognizing the personality traits (PTs) of two speakers. This study presents an approach to automatically predicting PTs in a dyadic conversation. First, a recurrent neural network (RNN) was used to model the relationship between Big Five Inventory 10 (BFI-10) items and linguistic features of spoken text in each turn of a speaker (speaker turn) to output a BFI-10 profile. The RNN applies a recurrent property to characterize the short-term temporal evolution of a dialog. Second, the coupled hidden Markov model (C-HMM) was employed to model the long-term turn-taking temporal evolution and cross-speaker contextual information for detecting the PTs of two individuals for the entire dialog represented by the BFI-10 profile sequence. The Mandarin Conversational Dialogue Corpus was used for evaluation. The evaluation result shows that an average perception accuracy of 79.66% for the big five traits was achieved using five-fold cross validation. Compared with conventional HMM and support vector machine-based methods, the proposed approach achieved a more favorable performance according to a statistical significance test. The encouraging results confirm the usability of this system for future applications.","2329-9290;23299290","","10.1109/TASLP.2016.2531286","Headquarters of University Advancement at the National Cheng Kung University; 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; 10.13039/501100003711 - Ministry of Science and Technology; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7410008","Big-Five Personality Trait;Big-five personality trait;Coupled Hidden Markov Model;Coupled Hidden Markov model;Dyadic Conversation;Personality Trait Perception;dyadic conversation;personality trait perception","Blogs;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;IEEE transactions;Pragmatics;Speech;Support vector machines","hidden Markov models;natural language processing;recurrent neural nets;speaker recognition","BFI-10 items;BFI-10 profile sequence;C-HMM;Mandarin conversational dialogue corpus;PTs;RNN;big five inventory items;coupled hidden Markov model;cross-speaker contextual information;dyadic conversations;five-fold cross validation;linguistic features;long-term turn-taking temporal evolution;paralinguistic communication;personality trait perception;recurrent neural network;short-term temporal evolution;speaker recognition;spoken text;statistical significance test;support vector machine-based methods","","","","55","","","20160218","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

More and more sensors and medical actuators are available as commercial âoff-the-shelfâ (COTS) devices including personal area communication technologies. The presented system integrates these devices into a distributed network to provide medical care at remote locations. The system is designed to support mobile patients in their daily life and to provide real-time access and remote control in critical situations. Therefore, the combination of different communication types is introduced to meet all requirements. As part of the telemedical system, a Tele-Service-Center with an automated data analysis is integrated into the infrastructure to support the treatment of the patients. Altogether, this system offers the opportunity for improving the medical treatment of the patient while simultaneously reducing the costs.

"Ontology-Based Approach for Academic Evaluation System","S. Aminah; I. Afriyanti; A. Krisnadhi","Fac. of Comput. Sci., Univ. Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia","2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE)","20170518","2017","","","1569","1574","Academic evaluation is an important activity regularly conducted by every higher education institution to gauge the performance of education services and help the administrators of the institution improve the quality of those services. Implementation of academic evaluation almost always requires an integration of relevant data, which are often scattered in separate systems. Such an integration effort is often tedious and time consuming because the data must be gathered from different systems, manually integrated, and then presented in a format that meets some pre-determined academic evaluation criteria. One way to help reducing the amount of effort expended in the integration is to make the data available in a format that enables linking between any part of the data and allows various academic evaluation queries to be performed on them. Our work intends to realise this idea by using Semantic Web technologies, in particular ontology and linked data. In particular, our work is situated in a concrete use case based on the academic evaluation process as periodically conducted in Universitas Indonesia (UI). In this paper, we focus on the first step of this effort, namely the development of an ontology for academic evaluation with a particular emphasis on evaluation of undergraduate degree programs in UI. There has been a number of prior work focusing on the development of an ontology for a similar problem, yet none of them takes into account the fact that academic data evolve over time. Our ontology thus accounts for this aspect according to the UIs academic evaluation criteria.

Compliance with accessibility guidelines does not guarantee blind users' satisfaction when accessing websites. Meanwhile, in recent years, websites have undergone radical changes regarding design, development, and construction. Responsive design is a new trend that has a strong impact on web design. To determine blind users' experience with responsive design, the authors performed empirical tests to investigate the impact of responsive design on the emotions of blind users during web interactions. They measured user emotions by applying the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) instrument. Results show that although the responsive websites investigated had acceptable levels of accessibility, they posed numerous usability barriers and triggered intense, negative user emotions. Furthermore, the average number of negative emotional reactions for blind users was higher in the case of responsive web design than in the case of nonresponsive web design.","1070-986X;1070986X","","10.1109/MMUL.2017.21","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7924277","HCI design and evaluation methods;Internet/Web technologies;accessibility;blind user;healthcare;mobile;multimedia;software engineering;usability;user experience","Education;Guidelines;Internet and Web services;Market research;Medical services;Software engineering;Usability;Web design","Web design;handicapped aids","PANAS instrument;accessibility guidelines;blind users;positive and negative affect schedule instrument;responsive Web design","","","","","","","","Apr.-June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper, based on diverse experimental results, proposes an environment where elementary students can easily learn and practice computer programming. The proposed robot game environment used a tangible programming tool with which students can easily create robot programs, without learning syntax, and then validate their programming results; it can also provide various game activities to incite students' interest.

Students might not grasp concepts with traditional teaching methods, even if they are ideal. Likewise, instructors could also find computer science hard to teach. This predicament could lead to poor academic performance for students as well as students not possessing adequate programming skills needed for software development careers. Gamification is the application of game-like elements to non-gaming activities used to encourage people to participate in those activities and achieve specific goals. Emerging research proves the effectiveness of gamification in academia, especially in the computer science realm. Thus, we have built two gaming modules for teaching object-oriented programming (OOP) and binary search. This paper discusses the design, development, and testing of virtual reality instructional (VRI) modules based on gaming metaphors. Constructivism and usability were considered while developing them. A user study found that about 75% of undergraduate students found the OOP module was easy to use and about 92% of them thought that it is effective at helping them learn OOP.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5379-7; POD:978-1-5090-5380-3","10.1109/ISECon.2017.7910245","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7910245","Computer Science Education;Constructivism;Game-Based Learning","Games;Programming profession;Training;Unified modeling language;Usability","computer aided instruction;computer games;computer science;computer science education;educational courses;object-oriented programming;virtual reality","OOP module;VRI modules;binary search;computer science;constructivism;game-like elements;gamification;gaming metaphors;gaming modules;introductory programming courses;nongaming activities;object-oriented programming;programming skills;software development careers;teaching methods;undergraduate students;usability;virtual reality instructional modules","","","","","","","","11-11 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Automated methods can be useful to some extent but bringing the data analyst into the loop via interactive visual tools can help the discovery process tremendously. An inherent problem in this effort is that humans lack the mental capacity to truly understand spaces exceeding three spatial dimensions. To keep within this limitation, we describe a framework that decomposes a high-dimensional data space into a continuum of generalized 3D subspaces. Analysts can then explore these 3D subspaces individually via the familiar trackball interface while using additional facilities to smoothly transition to adjacent subspaces for expanded space comprehension. Since the number of such subspaces suffers from combinatorial explosion, we provide a set of data-driven subspace selection and navigation tools which can guide users to interesting subspaces and views. A subspace trail map allows users to manage the explored subspaces, keep their bearings, and return to interesting subspaces and views. Both trackball and trail map are each embedded into a word cloud of attribute labels which aid in navigation. We demonstrate our system via several use cases in a diverse set of application areas â cluster analysis and refinement, information discovery, and supervised training of classifiers. We also report on a user study that evaluates the usability of the various interactions our system provides.","1077-2626;10772626","","10.1109/TVCG.2017.2672987","10.13039/100000001 - National Science Foundation; 10.13039/100000138 - U.S. Department of Education; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7862917","High-dimensional data;PCA;ant colony optimization;subspace navigation;trackball","Cognition;Layout;Navigation;Space exploration;Three-dimensional displays;Two dimensional displays;Visualization","","","","","","","","","20170223","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Healthcare data are however very complex and difficult to manage. This is as a result of the astronomical growth of healthcare data, the high speed at which these data are generated as well as the diversity of data types in healthcare. The capturing, storage, analysis and retrieval of health related data are rapidly shifting from paper based system towards digitization. However, the vast volume as well as the complexity of these data makes it difficult for the data to be processed and analyzed by traditional approaches and techniques. Consequently, technologies such as cloud computing and virtualization are now gradually used for processing massive data effectively and securely in healthcare. Hence, the healthcare system is swiftly becoming a big data industry. Thus, this paper examines the concept of big data in healthcare, its benefits and attendant challenges. This paper revealed that the fragmentation of healthcare data, ethical issues, usability issues as well as security and privacy issues are some of the factors impeding the successful implementation of big data in healthcare. This paper therefore suggests that ensuring security and privacy of healthcare data, the adoption of a standardized healthcare terminology, education strategy and the design of usable systems for processing large volumes of data are some of the ways of successfully implementing big data in healthcare.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4171-8; POD:978-1-5090-4172-5","10.1109/FTC.2016.7821747","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7821747","big data;healthcare;information and communication technology","Big data;Biomedical imaging;Cloud computing;Databases;Google;Medical services;Security","Big Data;health care","Big Data;data complexity;data diversity;education strategy;healthcare data privacy;healthcare data security;healthcare system;standardized healthcare terminology","","","","","","","","6-7 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

HDR skill is important for core practices in science such as providing causal explanation for any phenomenon, designing of experiments and accepting or rejecting hypotheses. Few efforts have been made at the college level, especially in the context of biology, to develop HDR in learners. In order to address this gap, we have designed and developed a learning environment, Geneticus Investigatio (GI), to help improve learners' HDR skills in the context of Mendelian genetics.

"Does Personality Influence the Usage of Static Analysis Tools? An Explorative Experiment","J. P. Ostberg; S. Wagner; E.

One is using automatic static analysis tools. We have observed, however, that despite the low-cost help they offer, these tools areunderused and often discourage beginners. There is evidence that personality traits influence the perceived usability of a software. Thus, to support beginners better, we need to understand how theworkflow of people with different prevalent personality traits using these tools varies. For this purpose, we observed users' solution strategies and correlated them with their prevalent personality traits in an exploratory study with student participants within a controlled experiment. We gathered data by screen capturing and chat protocols as well as a Big Five personality traits test. We found strong correlations between particular personality traits and different strategies of removing the findings of static code analysis as well as between personality and tool utilization. Based on that, we offer take-away improvement suggestions. Our results imply that developers should be aware of these solution strategies and use this information to build tools that are more appealing to people with different prevalent personality traits.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-4155-4; POD:978-1-5090-2198-7","10.1109/CHASE.2016.024","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809490","Static analysis;learning;personality;software engineering","Correlation;Programming;Software engineering;Software quality;Usability;User interfaces","computer aided instruction;computer science education;software engineering","automatic static analysis tools;chat protocols;personality trait influence;personality trait test;software quality improvement;software usability;static code analysis;take-away improvement suggestions;user solution strategies","","","","","","","","16-16 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Imitation learning is relatively cheap in terms of time and labor and is a promising route to give robots the necessary functionalities for a widespread use in households, stores, hospitals, etc. However, current imitation learning techniques struggle with a number of challenges that prevent their wide usability. For instance, robots might not be able to accurately reproduce every human demonstration and it is not always clear how robots should generalize a movement to new contexts. This paper addresses those challenges by presenting a method to incrementally teach context-dependent motor skills to robots. The human demonstrates trajectories for different contexts by moving the links of the robot and partially or fully refines those trajectories by disturbing the movements of the robot while it executes the behavior it has learned so far. A joint probability distribution over trajectories and contexts can then be built based on those demonstrations and refinements. Given a new context, the robot computes the most probable trajectory, which can also be refined by the human. The joint probability distribution is incrementally updated with the refined trajectories. We have evaluated our method with experiments in which an elastically actuated robot arm with four degrees of freedom learns how to reach a ball at different positions.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4718-5; POD:978-1-5090-4719-2; USB:978-1-5090-4717-8","10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2016.7803300","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7803300","","Context;Education;Hidden Markov models;Humanoid robots;Manipulators;Trajectory","human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulators;mobile robots;probability;robot programming","context-dependent motor skills;hand coding;human demonstrations;incremental imitation learning;joint probability distribution;motor skill teaching;robot arm;robots","","","","","","","","15-17 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Research studies have shown that assessment methods also influence students' learning. Current assessment techniques, even those which include technology, focus more on summative assessment rather than formative. Formative assessment is necessary for teaching and assessment of complex skills like troubleshooting or network design. Therefore, there exists a need for assessments to capture students' problem solving process and chosen approaches during the assessment. By tracking a student's behaviors in an immersive assessment environment, the path that the student takes towards the solution can be studied. Virtual Worlds are naturally immersive environments and can be effectively used to record interactions that students made in the worlds. We have developed NetWorld in Open Wonderland, an open source software for creating 3D virtual worlds. NetWorld is a 3D virtual world built for detailed assessment of computer network concepts for computer science undergraduate students. This detailed assessment happens at 3 levels -- conceptual understanding, diagnostic abilities and the ability to design a network.

However, designing, developing, and deploying adaptive and mobile-oriented user interfaces for existing process engines are non-trivial, and require significant systematic efforts. To address this issue, we present a novel middleware-based approach, called MUIT, to developing and deploying the Mobility, User Interactions and Tasks into WS-BPEL engines. MUIT provides a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that provides some intuitive facilities to support the declarative development of adaptive, mobile-oriented, and Web-based user interfaces in WS-BPEL. The DSL can significantly reduce developersâ manual efforts of developing user interactions by preventing arbitrarily mixed code, and its runtime supports satisfactory user experiences. Additionally, MUIT can be seamlessly integrated into WS-BPEL without intrusions of existing process instances.

This paper examines the feasibility and the students' acceptability of the newly developed IT peer evaluation system. In implementing the system, three research questions were posed: 1. Does the new system facilitate classroom management? 2. Is the new system more accepted than the existing paper-based method by the students? 3. Does the new system promote the overall improvement of students' presentation skills? The preliminary results showed that the new system facilitated classroom management, and that it was accepted by the students primarily due to its functional requirement such as utility and non-functional requirement such as promptness.

This discipline is mainly manual in nature but there are subject areas such as Electrotherapy in which the direct manipulation of an electronic device is required for a proper learning of the therapy procedures. This is only possible during laboratory classes; thus autonomous learning is restricted. A recurrent complaint of students is that they only can study the matter in a theoretical way (with textbooks or using notes taken during the sessions) while in contrast their practical skills are evaluated in the exams. This is because they do not have the expensive equipment used in Electrotherapy and the access to teaching devices is restricted to the laboratory hours. The main objective of this work is the development and implementation of a mobile application that simulates the manipulation of clinical devices used in Electrotherapy with the aim of improving learning in this subject area of Physical Therapy. The secondary objectives are: to assess the impact of the application (satisfaction from students and learning outcomes) and to analyze if the application could serve as a reliable method for evaluating students' knowledge of the electrotherapy techniques.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3063-7; POD:978-1-5090-3064-4","10.1109/IMCTL.2016.7753766","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7753766","Autonomous learning;Electrotherapy;Mobile learning","Computer science;Education;Electrodes;Medical treatment;Mobile communication;Three-dimensional displays;Usability","laboratories;mobile learning;patient treatment;teaching","autonomous learning;clinical device manipulation;electronic device direct manipulation;electrotherapy university teaching;laboratory classes;learning outcomes;m-learning;mobile application development;mobile application implementation;physical therapy;student satisfaction;teaching devices;therapy procedures;university education","","","","","","","","17-19 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are one of such advanced means to access educational material and resources anywhere/anytime in the world. Invention of cloud computing technology has opened many options for organizations and individual to share the educational resources among students. By adopting cloud computing organizations can save various recurring costs such as ICT hardware/software, licensing, storage space, backups, maintenance and human resources. Cloud computing enables teachers and students to access and approach the academic material ubiquitously through portable appliances (smart phones, tablets, IPAD's etc.). There are numerous public cloud applications (offerings) available for accessing educational resources in urban as well as rural vicinity. The Usability evaluation of these cloud-based services in a particular academic atmosphere is significant prior to their adoption. Moreover, this enables the stakeholders to make better decisions to adopt these contemporary services. In this paper we present the usability evaluation of public cloud applications across three universities in Pakistan from stakeholders' perspective i.e. (teachers and students).

However, despite the progress registered in the use of e-collaboration system as educational tools through the incorporation of constructivism learning theories and its related didactics in higher educational institution, the approach has not yet been successfully transferred to the classroom. More importantly, there are still misconceptions among researchers regarding students achieving authentic learning from online interaction and collaboration. In an attempt to close this gap, a framework was developed to assist in the design, development and implementation of e-collaboration in a higher education institution. The framework addresses the development process of e-collaboration content, approaches for e-collaboration, pedagogical didactics, learning theories, and roles of users in e-collaboration. In an attempt to validate the framework, an e-collaboration system named `Teach, Learn, and Research E-collaboration System' (TELERECS), was developed and experimentally implemented in a classroom context. An experimental research design based on control and experimental groups, pre/post-test and usability survey were used to validate the framework. The results revealed that there is significant difference between the post-test mean scores of the experimental and control groups. In addition, there is moderate, positive monotonic correlation between easy to use and post-test-scores; and between useful for team work and post-test-score for the experimental group. These imply that the framework offers a promising basis for meaningful learning. Future work includes a further exploration and validation of the framework and comparing results.","","","10.1109/ISMSC.2015.7594061","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7594061","Conceptual Framework;E-collaboration;Evaluation;Validation;experimental design;posttests;pretest","Collaboration;Electronic publishing;Information services;Instruments;Internet;Team working;Usability","Internet;computer aided instruction;distance learning;educational courses;further education;groupware","Internet;TELERECS;classroom context;conceptual framework;constructivism learning theory;educational tool;electronic collaboration;higher educational institution;monotonic correlation;online interaction;pedagogical didactics;teach-learn-and research e-collaboration system;undergraduate course","","","","","","","","19-20 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These alternative communication pathways have already been employed under various forms to allow severely handicapped people to use assistive devices. Given that most of currently developed BCIs only provide a visual feedback to the user, the aim of this study was to observe the result provided by an auditory feedback based on pitch. The BCI developed to this end classifies two different commands using sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) frequency features. The experiment consisted in sessions of trials during which the subjects were asked to perform motor imagery or to rest. Except for the first session, the system provided the subjects with a realtime feedback based on the learning data of the previous sessions. This feedback was generated by a control signal resulting of the classification of the extracted features by a Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm. Half of the 16 subjects were given visual feedback, consisting in a cursor movement, and the other half received auditory feedback, consisting in a pitch variation. Although the performance of the visual feedback BCI was superior during the first sessions, the final third session classification rates were 69.7 and 70.3% for respectively visual and auditory conditioning. These results tend to show that there might be no significant difference between the two types of feedback after long enough training. Moreover, this study also demonstrate the usability of a SVR classifier.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1787-4; POD:978-1-5090-1788-1","10.1109/MECATRONICS.2016.7547136","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7547136","","Art;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Frequency measurement;Training;Usability;Visualization","brain-computer interfaces;handicapped aids;medical signal processing;regression analysis;support vector machines","SMR frequency features;SMR-based BCI;SVR algorithm;assistive devices;auditory feedback;brain-computer interfaces;cerebral activity;control signal;handicapped people;muscled-based pathways;pitch;sensorimotor rhythm;support vector regression","","","","","","","","15-17 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a consequence, examinations as well as didactical approaches need to become competence-oriented. Unfortunately, competence-oriented examinations and assessments of the efficacy of didactical approaches are fairly hard - currently, no generally accepted approaches for competence-oriented evaluation are available. To make things worse, software engineering is a complex subject matter. Therefore, intended learning outcomes in software engineering education also tend to be quite complex and vary widely with a course's context. This paper provides details on how SECAT, a Software Engineering Competence Assessment Tool, is used to assess the efficacy of didactical approaches in software engineering education in a competence-oriented matter. To that end, SECAT needs to be adapted to the specific context, namely a particular didactical approach with its associated intended learning outcomes. Intended learning outcomes are related to specific competences, including non-technical skills. The paper presents results from applying SECAT for assessing the efficacy of employed didactical approaches in several software engineering courses. Furthermore, the paper shows an example of how SECAT's assessment results are used to improve didactical approaches for upcoming instances of these courses. SECAT and its underlying methodology is one step forward in competence assessment in software engineering.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8633-3; POD:978-1-4673-8634-0","10.1109/EDUCON.2016.7474603","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7474603","assessment of competences;competences;didactical approach;evaluation;evaluation of didactical approaches;non-technical skills;software engineering;software engineering education","Context;Creativity;Education;Informatics;Sensitivity;Software engineering;Usability","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;software engineering;teaching","SECAT;competence assessment;competence-oriented approaches;competence-oriented examinations;course context;didactical approaches;learning outcomes;software engineering competence assessment tool;software engineering education;student competences;teaching","","","","16","","","","10-13 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper addresses the bidirectional coupling between a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) haptic feedback device and a general-purpose modelling and simulation environment. In particular, an open-source library is developed to couple the Force Dimension omega.7 haptic device with the 20-sim modelling and simulation environment. The presented coupling interface is also compatible with all the different haptic devices produced by Force Dimension. The proposed integrated haptic interface makes it possible to track the user's motion, detect collisions between the user-controlled probe and virtual objects, compute reaction forces in response to motion or contacts and exert an intuitive force feedback on the user. A real-time one-to-one correspondence between reality and virtual reality can be transparently created. This allows for a variety of possible applications. Stability issues, performance issues, design and virtual prototyping challenges can be addressed and investigated for research purposes. In addition, design and virtual prototyping are also of interest to industry. Realistic training environments can be developed for the user considering different possible operations and stressing the importance of usability and user experience. Experiments based on using haptics technology in the field of education can also be easily performed. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed coupling, a case study is presented.

AI has Python-like lists typically manipulated with loops, but implementing such loops correctly is challenging for novice AI programmers.

We conducted an empirical study on the use of natural language for computation, and found that, although it provides support for understanding computational concepts, it introduces additional difficulties when used for coding. Following a design study with target users, we distilled our findings into a series of design guidelines for novice programming environments that incorporate natural language. These guidelines drove the design of Flip, a bimodal programming language for young people's game creation activities. Two empirical studies examined the extent to which these embodied design guidelines support ease of use and an understanding of computation.

In recent years, various software assignment techniques have been designed to introduce heterogeneity into network hosts for the maximum network survivability. However, few work consider practical constraints involved in the software assignment process. To close such a gap, in this work we model the software assignment problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, which incorporates several real-world criteria simultaneously, including network survivability, system feasibility and usability. To solves this multi-objective problem efficiently, we propose an ant colony optimization (ACO) based algorithm, where colonies of artificial ants work collaboratively through both heuristic information and pheromone-mediated communication to iteratively search for better solutions. To validate the generalizability of the proposed method, we experiment our algorithm on various types of network topologies with different parameter settings. The results show that our model can be applied as an effective method for assigning software for multiple objectives. The experimental results also provide interesting insights for optimal software assignment.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7876-5; POD:978-1-4673-7877-2","10.1109/CNS.2015.7346840","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346840","","Computers;Network topology;Security;Software algorithms;Software packages;Usability","Internet;ant colony optimisation;computer network reliability;computer network security;invasive software;iterative methods","ACO based algorithm;Internet worm;active cyber defense;ant colony optimization based algorithm;malicious attack;multiobjective optimization problem;multiobjective software assignment;network survivability;network topology;pheromone-mediated communication;software diversity;well-accepted security principle","","","","25","","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Students learn more with less text that covers the same core topics","A. Edgcomb; F. Vahid; R. Lysecky","Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside, Riverside, CA, USA","2015 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","20151207","2015","","","1","5","For textbooks on technical topics, the typical amount of text used is more than what many college students will read. Some teachers observe, and students report, that students commonly skim such text. As such, a writing style that aggressively minimizes text while still teaching the core technical topic may improve student learning; if text is short enough, students may then read and study the text more carefully. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of text quantity on amount learned. We created and compared content styles using a lesson that taught Google search techniques. The two main content styles were normal text and minimal text. The normal text style included 6-12 sentences followed by 1-3 examples. The minimal text style included 1-2 sentences followed by 1-3 examples. We conducted a randomized control study with 168 participants enrolled in a college-level Introduction to Computing course for non-computing majors. Each participant was randomly assigned one lesson style. We provided a pre-lesson and post-lesson quiz, each with ten questions. Additionally, the participants completed background and follow-up surveys. The study was part of a course homework assignment, so self-selection bias was limited. The course is primarily taken by non-majors and covers the basics of Word, Excel, and HTML. An improvement score is a participant's post-lesson minus pre-lesson quiz scores. The average improvement score for minimal text was 2.4 (6.5 - 4.1), which is higher (p-value <; 0.01) than the average improvement score for normal text of 1.1 (5.1 - 4.0). Thus, teaching the same topic using less text led to more learning. The conclusion is not that materials should be watered down, but rather that great attention should be paid to using minimal text while teaching the same core topics.","","Paper:978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344322","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344322","STEM;college education;college textbooks;digital content;digital education;digital learning;lesson assessment;minimal text;text length","Atmospheric measurements;Education;Google;Length measurement;Particle measurements;Usability;Writing","computer aided instruction;computer science education;teaching","Excel;Google search techniques;HTML;Word;computing course;course homework assignment;randomized control;student learning","","1","","13","","","","21-24 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Software environments such as simulators are very flexible, and thus often used. On the other hand, if the target hardware is complex and large, it is very hard to finish the simulation in practical time because of software's slow simulation speed. Thus, we develop a hardware environment for efficient evaluation of computer systems. We propose and develop an IBM PC Compatible SoC on an FPGA where hardware developers can evaluate their custom architectures. The SoC has an x86 soft core processor which can run general purpose operating systems. By making the proposed system run on FPGAs of two major vendors, i.e. Xilinx and Altera, we believe that it can be widely adopted. Besides, the SoC can be used for learning computer systems, because of its open-source policy. In this paper, we detail the design and implementation of the proposed SoC, and verify that it accurately runs some applications. As a case study to demonstrate usability of the SoC for computer research, we implement two types of L2 caches in Verilog HDL and evaluate their performance by running the SPEC CPU2000 INT benchmark suite.

We address in this paper the latter issue, of using data from professional networks for adjusting an engineering specialization curriculum. To this end, we built an adaptive recommender system that consists of several tools (modules) to create a data pipeline, perform data analysis tasks and provide recommendations for professors' council regarding the adjustment of the learning curriculum. The system includes an educational component with modules for course annotation, timeline generator based on learning curriculum and students' skills analysis, and a novel professional network analysis component, with modules to parse students' and graduates' profiles and extract their skills, creating a skills' timeline and identifying the most desired skills that should be (eventually more thoroughly) covered by the curricula. Through the automatic extraction of the set of skills covered by syllabi, compared with LinkedIn profile information for a significant percentage of our alumni (graduates) for the last 5 years, we were thus able to provide valuable feedback regarding the efficiency of our learning programmes.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8481-7; POD:978-1-4799-8482-4; USB:978-1-4799-8480-0","10.1109/ICSTCC.2015.7321402","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7321402","data mining;learning curriculum;professional network analysis;recommender system;social network","Companies;Computers;Education;Employment;Industries;LinkedIn","computer aided instruction;data mining;educational courses;engineering education;professional aspects;recommender systems;social networking (online)","LinkedIn profile information;SNA/PNA;adaptive recommender system;computer science course;course annotation;curriculum adjuster;data analysis tasks;data pipeline;economics course;educational component;engineering specialization curriculum;graduate profiles;learning curricula;learning programmes;mathematics course;physics course;professor council;recommendation system;skills timeline;social/professional network data analysis;sociology course;student profiles;student skills analysis;syllabi;timeline generator","","","","20","","","","14-16 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We exploit the distance metric of Lorentzian space in classification problem. It is a special metric which may give a zero distance for far points. To take best benefit from structural and other properties of the Lorentzian space, a special projection over the data sets is applied. By this projection, basic geometrical operations are used; namely translation (shifting), compression and rotation. Our new algorithm does classification according to the nearest neighbor in Lorentzian space.

While e-learning can improve the efficiency with which information is shared with students, the quality of the learning material is not guaranteed. As such, there is a requirement for a comprehensive evaluation of the quality of the learning experiences provided by e-learning systems. The work described in this paper aimed to validate the Dyslexia Adaptive E-Learning (DAEL) framework as an effective tool for meeting the needs of students with dyslexia. A quality assessment approach was employed to examine the extent to which DAEL can meet the minimum standards and deliver improvements in the quality of the learning experiences that are delivered to dyslexic students via e-learning technologies. The validation results outlined in this study are reported according to data collected from an original survey that involved 149 dyslexic individuals and field experts who have experience with web-based learning management systems. The results were compared with existing literature to identify trends and validate the conclusions. It is anticipated that the empirically validated framework that emerged from this study will be of benefit to researchers who are involved in the development of adaptive e-learning systems for students with disabilities.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6600-4; POD:978-1-4799-6601-1; USB:978-1-4799-6599-1","10.1109/ICCSE.2015.7250252","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7250252","Acceptability;Accessibility and User Experience;Dyslexic students;E-learning;Hypermediality;validation","Adaptive systems;Electronic learning;Sociology;Standards;Statistics;Usability","computer aided instruction;handicapped aids","DAEL framework;Web based learning management systems;comprehensive evaluation;dyslexia adaptive e-learning;e-learning systems;electronic technology;learning material;quality assessment approach","","0","","13","","","","22-24 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This leads to development processes that may not give enough attention to the importance of UX/UI design for the product under development. Moreover, such small teams may lack the required organization skills that help them manage how they work together. As a result, such teams usually face problems with delivering the ârightâ product, as well as not being able to follow a sustainable development process. In a similar context, CS students in programming classes are facing almost the same problems of small teams in industry. To tackle these problems, many researchers and practitioners have proposed integrating practices from agile and UX design methods to help developers emphasize the UX requirements and be able to organize their work environment. Despite the differences in how they approach their goals, both agile and UX teams seek user satisfaction by providing working and usable software. In our research, we explore how such integration can be a good fit for both CS students and software developers. We begin by showing our proposed set of practices that can be directly applied by developers. We also show how we will proceed by focusing on Pair Programming (PP) as an agile practice that promotes a collaborative work environment, which we will study its impact on students who build user interfaces in a Mobile Software Development course. Using PP in a class sitting will help us evaluate how agile practices that emphasize collaborative workspaces work with UX design, as well as introducing an adaptive and collaborative teaching approach that can be used in CS programming labs.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7646-4; Electronic:978-1-4673-7648-8; POD:978-1-4673-7649-5","10.1109/CTS.2015.7210467","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7210467","Frameworks for collaboration;collaboration in education;collaborative software development","Collaboration;Context;Decision support systems;Education;Medical services;Software;Sustainable development","computer science education;educational courses;software prototyping;software reusability;teaching;user centred design","Mobile Software Development course;UX design methods;adaptive teaching approach;agile design methods;collaborative teaching approach;collaborative work environment;pair programming;practice-oriented integration approach;usability enhancement;user experience","","1","","20","","","","1-5 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, the proposed method is able to measure the diversity loss caused by any individual in the population. This information is useful in the selection process as the algorithm can perform a diversity-preservation selection based on the measured diversity loss contributed by each individual. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed metric in enhancing the diversification of the solution set, we implement the metric on the well-known multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with decomposition.

From the research point of view the authors want to (1) frame the development of the tool in the socio-constructivist paradigm, and (2) bring the learner-centeredness via participatory design. The paper reports a series of workshops in which HCI students were asked to design a mobile tool for learning programming. The workshops followed the participatory design methodology. Each workshop set its very participants into a scenario different than other workshops by means of variation in introductory tools. The participants output -- in the form of design ideas described with tools like sketches, storyboards, and/or simple text -- at each workshop was then collected. These ideas were classified according to five categories: socio-constructivist, learning management, usability, software visualization, and miscellaneous. Usability and socio-constructivist accounted for the majority of the ideas. The number usability ideas can be partly explained because of the context (participants were HCI students). However, the abundance of socio-constructivist ideas points to the importance which students give to learning in a sociocultural context. Moreover, the sheer amount of ideas -- otherwise not envisioned by the designers -- explains the need to build mlearning tools in a participatory fashion. Thus, the results of experiments support authors' stand of designing such tools in a learner-centered participatory fashion and framing the development in socio-constructivist paradigm.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9967-5; POD:978-1-4799-9968-2","10.1109/LaTiCE.2015.35","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7126243","Computer Science Education;Mlearning;Participatory Design;Software Visualization","Conferences;Context;Education;Games;Mobile communication;Usability;Visualization","computer aided instruction;computer science education;human computer interaction;mobile learning;software engineering","HCI students;Jeliot Mobile tool;design ideas;learner-centered participatory framework;learner-centeredness;learning management idea;miscellaneous idea;participatory design methodology;programming learning;sketch tool;socio-constructivist ideas;socio-constructivist m-learning tool;sociocultural context;software visualization idea;storyboard tool;text tool;usability idea","","3","","26","","","","9-12 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This educational paradigm is of paramount importance for society nowadays, because expands access opportunities to education at all levels. These learning environments can take advantage of Open Educational Resources. Using OER is a growing trend and it is turning into a recommendation by some governments and international education forums. Nevertheless, in spite of the availability of OER websites, quite a few of them do not consider accessibility design principles, therefore these websites present access barriers for users with disabilities. Besides, only a reduce number of these websites offer accessible resources, i.e. digital contents suitable for users with disabilities. On the other hand, in web environment, findability is a design consideration that improves the user's searchable experience by simplifying the location and acquisition of elements in websites. In this restricted scenario, findability of educational resources is a key issue for users with disabilities. In this research, we address the issue of findability of Open Educational Resources (OER), from the perspective of inclusive participation of users with disabilities, by considering three aspects: web accessibility, some usability best practices oriented to users with disabilities and Information Architecture. The evaluation is performed in some important and well known OER websites.","","Electronic:978-3-9075-8913-7; POD:978-1-4799-9909-5","10.1109/ICEDEG.2015.7114457","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7114457","Information Architecture;Open Educational Resources;e-Education;findability;usability;web accessibility","Education;Guidelines;Information architecture;Navigation;Organizations;Standards;Usability","Web sites;computer aided instruction;groupware;handicapped aids;human computer interaction;user interfaces","OER Websites;Web accessibility;Web environment;digital contents;e-education;educational collaborative environments;educational paradigm;element acquisition;element location;findability evaluation;information architecture;international education forums;open educational resources;usability best practices;users-with-disabilities perspective","","3","","36","","","","8-10 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A distinctive set of communication skills is needed by people who work successfully in virtual teams, and few universities or companies provide structured education and training in virtual teamwork. At a midsized southeastern Masters Comprehensive University, professors from the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Business, and Education came together to explore how they might use cross-disciplinary student teams (groups comprised of students with different backgrounds and educational goals) to teach concepts in their own disciplines while providing students with the opportunity to become more proficient in virtual team communication. Research questions: (1) Can cross-disciplinary student team projects successfully support learning in virtual team communication as well as address the learning objectives of specific courses? (2) What can faculty learn from a cross-disciplinary teaching model that can be applied to virtual teams? Situating the case: Experiential learning is based on performing real tasks and reflecting on that process; it benefits learners by engaging them in complex, authentic situations. Virtual teams are significant because they support a great deal of the work currently taking place in our global economy; they are significant in higher education because students need to develop skills in international virtual communication before they are introduced to high-stakes work environments. In previous cases, students have collaborated across national cultures to develop project deliverables, such as websites, reports, and usability studies and present them in virtual environments using such tools as WebEx, Skype, and live streaming. How this case was studied: The findings from this case are based on individual student reflections, which were used to create a data matrix for each project, and instructor observation and evaluation. About the case: In Spr- ng 2013, six faculty from the same university worked together to incorporate virtual teams into their classrooms. These six faculty members were divided into two groups of three with each group representing three colleges mentioned earlier. The faculty developed two interdisciplinary projects (one on infographics and another on social media) that enabled rich and diverse student collaboration. In both groups, the three faculty leaders worked together to define a project scope that students could achieve and that would relate to learning goals in each discipline. Conclusions: The lessons learned from this experience are that: (1) technical challenges will occur; (2) students from all disciplines must receive the same information; (3) instructors must balance respect for their colleagues and support for their students; (4) team assignments need to be consistent and fair; (5) instructors need to establish appropriate and fair assessment measurements for their own students; and (6) projects need to be realistic in order to show the students the value of virtual work.","0361-1434;03611434","","10.1109/TPC.2015.2429973","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7108078","Cross-disciplinary;experiential learning;multiple disciplines;teaching case;virtual teams;virtual teamwork;virtual world","Computer aided instruction;Streaming media;Teamwork;Virtual groups;Virtual reality","computer aided instruction;media streaming;virtual reality","ICT;Skype;WebEx;cross-disciplinary teaching model;cross-disciplinary virtual teams;data matrix;experiential learning;global economy;infographics;international virtual communication;live streaming;southeastern Masters Comprehensive University;structured education;virtual teamwork","","3","","34","","","20150514","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Existing approaches do not support smart phones well due to the deficiency of security, high cost, and poor usability. We collect 200 users' handwaving actions with their smart phones and discover an appealing observation: the waving pattern of a person is kind of unique, stable and distinguishable. In this paper, we propose OpenSesame, which employs the users' waving patterns for locking/unlocking. The key feature of our system lies in using four fine-grained and statistic features of handwaving to verify users. Moreover, we utilize support vector machine (SVM) for accurate and fast classification. Our technique is robust compatible across different brands of smart phones, without the need of any specialized hardware.

These activities accelerated after Bologna process agreement. E-participation not only covers the general participation of citizens, but also enables higher education decision makers to communicate with each other and with all stakeholders within the university. During more than ten years the EU has funded projects in the area of e-democracy and e-participation in order to respond to this emerging requirement. The aim of some of these projects has been to equip universities with e-participation tools or platforms. There have been some EU projects that turned out to become great successes while some other projects have not been particularly useful. Lots of studies have been published about these projects and the core ideas behind them. But they have mainly covered technical aspects and less about non-technical challenges such as socio-cultural differences, rules and regulations and challenges related to unifying different decision making processes. In the present study an attempt has been made to identify the non-technical factors which have an impact for the success of e-participation in higher education. The EU-funded project MyUniversity has been selected as a case study. It involved 17 higher institutions in Europe. Data collection was conducted by means of recorded semi structured interviews with stakeholders of the MyUniversity project. Data-analysis was done using a systematic coding of audio flies using the Nvivo software and based on grounded theory principles. The emerging main categories of non-technical factors identified by interpreting data have been the major contribution of this study. The study clearly demonstrates that non-technical factors were very influential in the MyUniversity project. The following nontechnical factors were identified as crucial for the success of e-participation in higher education: 1) The socio-cultural context, 2) Id- ntification of users, 3) Usability, drivers and motivation. The study showed that deeper needs assessments locally at each university and ""cultural studies"" are very crucial and should not be neglected, even though conducting them for every single involved country or institution are both budget and time consuming. Moreover, each educational institute should use its own motivational techniques based on their cultural studies in order to involve their users. This study concludes that the ""business strategies"" used by EU for introducing e-participation projects in higher education in EU countries need to be revised taking into account the identified issues.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4799-3922-0; POD:978-1-4799-3923-7; USB:978-1-4799-3921-3","10.1109/FIE.2014.7043998","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7043998","EU-project;MyUniversity;e-democracy;e-participation;higher education;non-technical factors","Communities;Decision making;Educational institutions;Europe;Interviews;Portals","computer aided instruction;cultural aspects;data analysis;decision making;further education;social sciences","Bologna process agreement;EU-project;Europe;MyUniversity;Nvivo software;data analysis;decision making;e-democracy;e-participation;grounded theory principles;higher education;non-technical factors;socio-cultural differences","","0","","19","","","","22-25 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In turn, this will foster the development of learning networks and communities. In this context, teachers play an instrumental role as facilitators, as their expertise enables them to assess the quality of content and to design and adapt learning activities according to individual learners' profiles. However, we wanted to find out how the interaction with open educational resources would enhance teachers' activities, if digital resources could be easily integrated in their actual educational curricula, or if teachers felt that the introduction of these resources would improve the educational experience of their students. This paper addresses the usage and usability of open educational resources from teachers' perceptions. For this, we utilized the Open Discovery Space portal, a socially-powered and multilingual open educational resources' repository intended to support teachers, students and parents to intuitively identify, share, reuse and revise digital learning resources. This analysis was performed taking into account both actual content and ancillary services offered by the portal (e.g., content sharing, content discussion, community building), and was methodologically organized as a streamlined cognitive walkthrough that included two evaluation workshops in late 2013 and early 2014, and a further debriefing survey in mid 2014. The first workshop included a brief course to teachers on the functionalities and aims of the Open Discovery Space portal and an assessment survey. The s- cond workshop was devoted to answer the questions posed by the teachers participating after a 6-week period of usage and reflection. Again, the workshop was completed with an assessment survey on the portal's content and services. Finally, in mid 2014 a final evaluation, survey-based session was (will be at the time of writing this abstract) carried out after continuing interaction with the portal's content and services during several months.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4799-3922-0; POD:978-1-4799-3923-7; USB:978-1-4799-3921-3","10.1109/FIE.2014.7044065","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044065","e-learning;open educational resources;survey;usability","Communities;Conferences;Educational institutions;Europe;Portals;Usability","computer aided instruction;portals","assessment survey;digital learning resources;educational curricula;educational process;learning networks development;open discovery space portal;open educational resources","","0","","20","","","","22-25 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"The application model of learning management system quality in asynchronous blended learning system","I. Le stari; B. Hendradjaya","Sekolah Teknik Elektro dan Informatika, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia","2014 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (ICEECS)","20150219","2014","","","223","228","The process of blended learning system gives benefits in terms of cost-effectiveness and easy interaction between students and teachers. One of the strategies is to implement the asynchronous type of interaction. An online activity in blended learning using e-learning models is known as a Learning Management System (LMS). Currently LMS has been widely applied in the educational process in higher education institutions. To assess the results of the application of the LMS, we need a quality model that can be referenced by developers of LMS. This study developed a model for the application of quality in an asynchronous blended learning system The model allows an LMS can be evaluated by a party who is not an expert in the field of software technology, especially for the users, who is usually not involved in the system development phase directly. This model is expected to be a reference for both by the developers and users. In this study, the quality of the application the model is applied based on ISO/IEC 9126. This model supports the evaluation of two primary requirements, the needs of virtual communication and the delivery of educational activities, which has seven features, namely: discussion boards, e-mail, blogs, lectures, assignments, quizzes and grades. The quality characteristics in this model, among others are the suitability of implementation, ease of procedures, flexibility (interaction, tests and learner control), user security permissions, as well as response time, availability, reliability and completeness of the system. So the quality factor is proposed functionality (suitability, accurattime behavioreness, security), reliability (maturity), usability (learnability) and efficiency (time behavior). The proposed model was validated with a case study of LMS in the Politeknik Caltex Riau (LMS PCR). The results have shown that the model could offer a quality evaluation of LMS PCR. The model has been able to demonstrate that the LMS PCR was conformed to the re- uirements of an asynchronous blended learning system.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-8477-0; Electronic:978-1-4799-8478-7; POD:978-1-4799-8479-4","10.1109/ICEECS.2014.7045251","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045251","ISO/IEC 9126;asynchronous;blended learning;learning management system","Electronic learning;IEC standards;ISO standards;Least squares approximations;Q-factor;Security;Time factors","computer aided instruction;educational institutions;further education","ISO/IEC 9126;LMS;LMS PCR;LMS in the Politeknik Caltex Riau;application model;asynchronous blended learning system;e-learning models;educational activities;educational process;higher education institutions;learning management system quality;online activity;quality model;software technology;virtual communication","","0","","37","","","","24-25 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, as part of enhancing learning, the game intends to provide knowledge and awareness on sustainability issues for public constructions relevant to engineering and architectural disciplines. Deployed targeted questionnaires with thirty-three (33) computer science students in UK and analysed through a Likert Scale findings from evaluation demonstrate that a conceptual change may be achieved in relation to how sustainability has been perceived. A questionnaire with 20 questions was distributed to students for evaluating various elements of the game such as usability characteristics, accumulation, assimilation and consolidation of new knowledge patterns related to the learning-oriented benefits of the game with an implicit focus on whether the game can be integrated within an academic setting. The fundamental conclusion from the analysis of the game uptake is that it enhances student's engagement with sustainability issues, especially in blended learning contexts for `blending' different pedagogical approaches with game-oriented features as means of improving educational practice.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4742-3; POD:978-1-4799-4741-6; USB:978-1-4799-4743-0","10.1109/IMCTL.2014.7011135","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7011135","mobile serious games;public spaces;sustainability;urban cities","Cities and towns;Collaboration;Computers;Conferences;Education;Games;Mobile communication","computer aided instruction;environmental science computing;mobile learning;public administration;serious games (computing);sustainable development","Likert scale;Sustainability Serious Game;architectural discipline;blended learning;collective intelligence;engineering disciplines;game usability characteristics;knowledge pattern accumulation;knowledge pattern assimilation;knowledge pattern consolidation;learning-oriented game benefits;mobile game;public constructions;sustainability issues awareness","","0","","14","","","","13-14 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, our study on actualization of higher education institutions (HEIs) students' data-focused InfoVis observes the incompatibility of the existing InfoVis UCD models of past related studies with the actualization of HEI domain-specific InfoVis. This incompatibility is arguably traceable to the peculiarity of the domain InfoVis users-data administrators, data analysts, the policy administrators and decision makers. Due to our work field experience, and objective argument from literatures reviewed, we employed a comparative content analysis and in-depth critique methods to modify the existing InfoVis UCD methodologies so as to feature additional stages to comply with our domain specificity. This study therefore presents a modified InfoVis UCD methodology that attends to the observed limitations of the previous works, and finally, our work in progress is presented.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5813-9; POD:978-1-4799-5814-6","10.1109/IUSER.2014.7002687","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7002687","InfoVis;InfoVis UCD methodology;higher education institution;user-centered design","Biology;Data visualization;Information systems;Usability;User centered design;Visualization","computer aided instruction;data visualisation;further education;user centred design","HEI domain-specific InfoVis;InfoVis UCD models;InfoVis user-data administrators;comparative content analysis;data analysts;higher education institutions;in-depth critique methods;information visualization;policy administrators;student data-focused InfoVis;user-centered design methodology;user-centered information system","","0","","17","","","","2-5 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some of the proven benefits of thin clients are lower cost of ownership and very less power consumption which supports to Green Computing. The ability of thin client can be increased by reducing network latency to improve the performance and usability of thin clients. Network latency causes a great delay in transmitting a message or communication from one location to another. Many other external factors, like congestion in the network, bandwidth limitation, computer storage capacities and the distance between two locations also contribute to the delay. The proposed paper aims at the issues of Network Latency and its various aspects in a thin client network. The paper also undergoes with experimenting thin client with different environment to find network latency which helped in finding conclusion and proposing new ideology for reducing network latency.

In this study, we developed a Program Visualization (PV) with the main objective as a practical hands-on learning kit for novice in exploring and gaining basic skills of hardware software interfacing in visual environment. The ADDIE instructional design model has been used in the design of the visualization tool. Usability and user's satisfaction also have been conducted to evaluate the success of a PV in regard to the learning objectives. A total of 25 Polytechnic students were asked to complete a questionnaire adapted from Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ). The questionnaire consists of the following six dimensions of usability characteristics: design/layout, functionality, ease of use, satisfaction, outcome/future use and errors/reliability.

Although strong security measures are in place for most mobile systems, the area where these systems often fail is the reliance on the user to make decisions that impact the security of a device. As our prime example, Android relies on users to understand the permissions that an app is requesting and to base the installation decision on the list of permissions. Previous research has shown that this reliance on users is ineffective, as most users do not understand or consider the permission information. We propose a solution that leverages a method to assign a risk score to each app and display a summary of that information to users. Results from four experiments are reported in which we examine the effects of introducing summary risk information and how best to convey such information to a user. Our results show that the inclusion of risk-score information has significant positive effects in the selection process and can also lead to more curiosity about security-related information.","1545-5971;15455971","","10.1109/TDSC.2013.58","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6684532","Risk communication;mobile security;usability","Androids;Humanoid robots;Mobile communication;Privacy;Security;Smart phones","mobile computing;risk management;security of data;smart phones","Android Apps;device security;intrusive applications;malicious applications;mobile devices;mobile systems;risk communication;risk-score information;security measures;security-related information;summary risk information","","12","","36","","","20131216","May-June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Its evaluation represents students' understanding on the learning contents. This complements the learning process where educators focus on the fulfillment of learning objectives. The current assessment method emphasizes on students' grade, and this is also the case for Computer Architecture course assessments. Therefore, this research proposed an evaluation method based on SOLO Taxonomy to analyse students' responses which indicates their actual understanding level. SOLO Taxonomy is applied as it consists of five hierarchical levels that can distinctly describe students' understanding level. This research highlights the overall responses to Computer Architecture course examination questions which are mapped into SOLO Taxonomy.

LO is a small, independent and reusable learning unit that accomplishes a single learning outcome. Due to the size, it is also called as micro learning object. It is also possible, to aggregate several types of LO to sequence the learning activities. Evaluation on LO is essential to study the merits and pitfalls to improve the design. Leaners' views are important to understand the guidelines and consideration to ensure the success of LOs as the learning support in a programming lab. Three types of micro LOs designed and developed for C programming module. Learning object review instrument (LORI 1.5) was used to evaluate LO by measuring six dimensions of quality. Eighty foundation in engineering students participated in evaluating the LOs. Overall, the evaluation results indicate that the three types of micro LOs (content object, practice object and assessment object) rated as acceptable learning support in a programming lab. The design issues outlined in this study could be a guide for academicians and researchers who keen in developing learning objects for programming languages.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5133-3; POD:978-1-4799-3702-8","10.1109/ICICM.2013.67","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6702827","component; learning objects;design issues.;evaluation;programming difficulties","Animation;Arrays;Materials;Programming;Syntactics;Usability;User interfaces","C language;computer aided instruction;computer science education","C programming module;LO;LORI 1.5;learning object review instrument;learning support;micro learning object;novice programming students;single learning outcome","","0","","28","","","","4-6 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, students often unknowingly interpreted the log scale as linear and were confused about the order of magnitude of a value in the negative exponent region. To address these issues, we used the results of our findings to develop and implement a set of online âessential skillsâ tasks to help students achieve a core level of mastery and fluency in reading log plots, a basic and critical skill for engineers. The online tasks were administered as for-credit homework assigned several times throughout the semester, and students spent 10-20 minutes on each assignment. Results of post-tests indicate that with this minimal practice, students were able to dramatically improve their accuracy in reading log plots compared to a control group with no log plot practice. Furthermore, testing one month after training demonstrated that student continued to retain the learned skill. Future development will focus on making these essentials skills task broadly available online and further improving effectiveness and usability.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4673-5261-1; POD:978-1-4673-5259-8; USB:978-1-4673-5260-4","10.1109/FIE.2013.6684990","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6684990","graph interpretation;logarithmic graphs;online homework;problem solving skills","Educational institutions;Engineering students;Interviews;Materials;Standards;Testing;Training","computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;graph theory;materials science computing","effectiveness improvement;for-credit homework assignment;logarithmic graphs;logarithmic plot reading;negative exponent region;online essential skills tasks;science engineering course;standard introductory materials;student accuracy improvement;university junior engineering students;university senior engineering students;university sophomore engineering students;usability improvement","","1","","8","","","","23-26 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The students engaged in recorded video, audio, and screen session as they searched academic resources. They had a free choice of search tool(s) on the topic of their study, specific to their needs. The study also used questionnaires and interviews with UEA faculty. A total of 64 subjects participated in the research. Forty-eight students were classified into three groups (undergraduates, masters, and PhD students) composed of 16 participants each; an additional 16 faculty members participated in the questionnaires and interviews. Participants were selected from all UEA faculties and included a mix of nationalities and genders. Results showed that user needs, skills, and persistence differ with respect to academic searching-they increase as education levels increase. In addition, results showed that users generally prefer using search tools because of their overall usability rather than dealing with online databases, even though such databases may be more effective. The study concludes that education level plays an important role-given the complex nature of huge amounts of information on the Web-in adopting different techniques and advanced search tools.","","Electronic:978-0-9893193-0-0; POD:978-1-4799-1272-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6661724","Web searching behavior;end user study;search academic resources;usability study","Education;Human computer interaction;Internet;Interviews;Search engines;Usability;Web search","Internet;educational administrative data processing;human factors","TAP;Think Aloud Protocol;UEA;University of East Anglia;Web searching behaviour;academic resources searching;audio session;observation methods;recorded video session;screen session;search process;search tools;user education levels","","0","","43","","","","7-9 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

E-government has been implemented for a considerable time in developed countries. However, E-government services still face many challenges in their implementation and general adoption in many countries including Saudi Arabia. It has been noted that the introduction of E-government is a major challenge facing the government of Saudi Arabia, due to possible concerns raised by its citizens. In addition, the literature review and the discussion identify the influential factors that affect the citizens' intention to adopt E-government services in Saudi Arabia. Consequently, these factors have been defined and categorized followed by an exploratory study to examine the importance of these factors. Therefore, this research has identified factors that determine if the citizen will adopt E-government services and thereby aiding governments in accessing what is required to increase adoption.","","Electronic:978-1-908320-13-1; POD:978-1-4799-0861-5","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6636384","E-government;G2C;adoption;citizens' intention;factors;influential factors;intention","Availability;Complexity theory;Education;Government;Security;Usability","government data processing;social aspects of automation","Saudi Arabia;citizen intention;e-government adoption;e-government services;government to business stakeholder;government to citizen stakeholder;government to government stakeholder;information and communications technology","","0","","32","","","","24-26 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important focus over the last few years has been to discover what are the hard-to-answer questions that developers ask while they are trying to comprehend their programs, and then to develop tools to help answer those questions. For example, when studying programmers working on everyday bugs, we found that they continuously ask âWhyâ and âWhy Notâ questions as they try to comprehend what happened. We developed the âWhylineâ debugging tool, which allows programmers to directly ask these questions of their programs and get a visualization of the answers. In a small lab study, Whyline increased productivity by a factor of about two. We studied professional programmers trying to understand unfamiliar code and identified over 100 questions they identified as hard-to-answer. In particular, we saw that programmers frequently had specific questions about the feasible execution paths, so we developed a new visualization tool to directly present this information. When trying to use unfamiliar APIs, such as the Java SDK and the SAP eSOA APIs, we discovered some common patterns that make programmers up to 10 times slower in finding and understanding how to use the appropriate methods, so we developed new tools to assist them.

Tablets and iPads, which are prevalent, can be utilized with dementia patients in portraying favorite music and family photographs via apps developed in close partnership with geriatric facilities. Anecdotal research has shown that non-verbal late-stage dementia patients have become stimulated when iPods played their beloved tunes. There is an unmet need in geriatric facilities for stimulating dementia patients, as well providing hard-core data for proving increased cognitive abilities with technology. Technology can help bridge the gap between patients and staff to improve the quality of life for the cognitively impaired. This study addresses cognitive functioning and quality of life for people diagnosed with dementia via technology. In recent times, the influx of older adults suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia related illness has impacted the U.S. Healthcare system. Cognition significantly declines in older adults with AD or dementia over the course of the disease, causing most to be dependent on caregivers, thus routinely institutionalized. Caregivers are often required to focus their attention on addressing the agitation or discomfort of the AD or dementia patient. Research has shown that technology instruments such as iPods, help stimulate those with dementia. This study focuses on innovative devices such as iPads and tablets, which are mainstream and easy to use, cannot only help determine stage of dementia, but also provide stimulation to improve cognitive functioning. It is hoped that this research will analyze that specially created apps and existing assistive software can be used to decrease the symptoms and improve cognition of older adults suffering from AD or other dementia related diseases. Via service-learning courses, students developed an easy-to-use application for tablets to help- older adults with disabilities more readily use the technology. Student programmers produced apps and performed usability tests with the dementia patients, as well as met with geriatric facility personnel to produce application software that meets the patients, family, and caregiver needs and expectations. For example, a student term project produced an application entitled Candoo that utilizes Google's voice recognition and synthesis engine to navigate the web, provide the weather, and supply pill reminder alerts. Another application example included one that allows families to electronically send photographs, video clips, and favorite music from anywhere to loved ones for enjoyment. Furthermore, older adults were assessed by nursing students for cognitive functioning before, and after the semester's intervention. Such mobile apps could allow dementia persons to become less agitated and stay in their homes longer, while also providing awareness and positive change of attitude by those of another generation towards the elderly. This research will discuss student developed mobile applications in the scope of helping improve the quality of life of patients with AD or dementia.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6245-0; POD:978-1-4673-6244-3","10.1109/LISAT.2013.6578252","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6578252","Accessibility;Aged User;Assistive Technologyies;Computer Science Education;Elderly;Older Adults;Senior Citizen;Software Engineering;Sundowning","Animals;Dementia;Mobile communication;Sociology;Statistics;Tablet computers","cognition;diseases;geriatrics;handicapped aids;mobile computing;patient treatment;speech recognition;speech synthesis","AD;Alzheimer patients;Candoo;Google voice recognition;Google voice synthesis engine;US healthcare system;caregiver anecdotes;cognitive abilities;cognitive functioning;geriatric facilities;iPads;iPods;mobile app development;music;nonverbal late-stage dementia patients;older adults;photographs;service-learning courses;student programmers;tablet application;usability research;usability tests;video clips","","5","","19","","","","3-3 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Using Intelligent Tutors to Teach Students How APIs Are Used for Software Engineering in Practice","V. Krishnamoorthy; B. Appasamy; C. Scaffidi","School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University","IEEE Transactions on Education","20130731","2013","56","3","355","363","Computer science courses typically incorporate integrated training in software engineering, which includes learning how to reuse existing code libraries in new programs. This commonly presents a need to use the libraries' application programming interfaces (APIs) during project-based learning activities. The students learn these APIs with little support from the instructor. Instead, they primarily learn from whatever code examples they find on the Web-a scattershot approach that is slow, frustrating, and sometimes fruitless. Preliminary work investigated an improved approach that provides students with intelligent API tutors. This interactive educational content walks students through code examples selectively harvested from the Web. This approach increased students' knowledge of API method names, but a key pedagogical challenge remained: Students still lacked an understanding of common problems and surprises that they might encounter when using APIs in practice. Perhaps even more crucially, the prior statistical study provided no information about how students would perceive and accept the intelligent tutor approach, when given a choice. Therefore, this paper presents an enhanced approach that augments intelligent tutors with selected information from online FAQs and online open-source code, thereby providing more explanation and context about how to use APIs in practice. A qualitative study assessed student perceptions of the system's usability as well as suggestions for improvement, revealing that 100% of students considered the approach to be useful. A key implication is that providing information from online FAQs, related articles, and open-source code could facilitate computer science students' learning how to use APIs.","0018-9359;00189359","","10.1109/TE.2013.2238543","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6422340","Application programming interface (API);computer science education;electronic learning;software engineering;software libraries","Computer science;Industries;Libraries;Open source software;Software engineering;Training","Internet;application program interfaces;computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;public domain software;software libraries;statistical analysis;teaching","API tutors;Web;application programming interfaces;computer science courses;computer science student learning;instructor;intelligent tutors;interactive educational content;online FAQ;online open source code;project-based learning activities;software engineering;system usability;teaching","","3","","37","","","20130128","Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, in contrast to the collaborative nature of programming, in particular among novice programmers, existing game design environments are solitary desktop-based applications with no or very limited support for sharing and collaboration. We have taken advantage of Web 2.0 technologies and its participative culture to develop a collaborative platform around game design activities that encourages social learning and integrates into the students' online social presence and lifestyle. We have employed open-Web technologies to build a game design environment using only HTML5 and JavaScript that lets users practice the game design and programming activities right inside their browser. Game design and game playing run on the client while an associated website hosts the created games and supports collaboration. This paper reports on the design, implementation, and evaluation of the game design environment. The preliminary evaluation of Agent Web's usability and performance demonstrates that not only does Agent Web meet its design goals, but also that the current Web is a hospitable environment for end-user game programming both on desktop and mobile devices.","1530-1362;15301362","Electronic:978-0-7695-4922-4; POD:978-1-4673-4930-7","10.1109/APSEC.2012.88","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6462756","Open Web;Web 2.0;end-user programming;game design environments;high-level languages;performance evaluation;usability testing","Browsers;Collaboration;Communities;Games;Programming profession;Visualization","Internet;computer aided instruction;computer games;computer science education;groupware;software engineering","HTML5;JavaScript;Web 2.0 technology;Web site;agent Web usability;collaborative platform;computer programming;desktop-based application;end-user game programming;game design activity;mobile device;open-Web educational game design;social learning;software engineering;teaching","","1","","30","","","","4-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Being conscious that our students' academic preparation and cognitive development affects our teaching strategies, we decided that human factors should be taken into account as well as flexibility. Such way will likely enable us to significantly increase our environment usability. The environment embeds thus basic concepts for synchronous and asynchronous cooperative code editing and group interaction. It is designed on modular distributed software architecture, implying supports for resources management, interaction, communication and cooperation between students. To achieve group awareness, we designed an events controller that exploit the project design structure with a notification mechanism diffusing each student action into the shared workspace to his friends.

The collaborative investment in the design of curriculum and course content was deliberate and adjusted in an iterative manner similar to the design processes taught. Two years into the program, as demand far outstripped spots available, an intake interview process was established. The pros and cons of this process are outlined. The major benefit appears to be the alignment of student expectations with program content. A desire at the launch of the program was to facilitate student support initiatives. Some data on student engagement are presented to assess how students feel about the communication baccalaureate degree.

Especially in the field of initiation courses in programming and data structures which may benefit from the efficient provided ways of communication and collaboration. This paper discusses a shared environment design enabling code sharing among several separated students involved in a common programming project. Being conscious that our students' academic preparation and cognitive development affects our teaching strategies, we decided that human factors should be taken into account as well as flexibility. Such way will likely enable us to significantly increase our environment usability. The environment embeds thus basic concepts for synchronous and asynchronous cooperative code editing and group interaction. It is designed on modular distributed software architecture, implying supports for resources management, interaction, communication and cooperation between students. To achieve group awareness, we designed an events controller that exploit the project design structure with a notification mechanism diffusing each student action into the shared workspace to his friends. We first survey ongoing research, and then present the main concepts and features of our java-based environment.","","CD:978-1-4673-2224-9; Electronic:978-1-4673-2225-6; Paper:978-1-4673-2226-3","10.1109/ICEELI.2012.6360677","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6360677","Cooperative Editing;Events notification;Initiation courses in programming;Multi-user Interfaces;Synchronous/Asynchronous Interaction","Collaboration;Collaborative work;Context;Programming profession;Software architecture;Writing","Java;computer aided instruction;computer science education;data structures;educational courses;groupware;human factors;software architecture;teaching","Java-based environment;academic preparation;cooperative code editing;data structures;group interaction;human factors;initiation courses;learner cooperative programming;modular distributed software architecture;networking advances;programming project;remote social interaction;shared editing workspace;teaching strategies","","0","1","19","","","","1-3 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Research of quality based autonomic context processing for pervasive applications","H. Yan; D. Zheng; J. Wang","Ira A.

Therefore, pervasive applications need a middleware that can detect and act upon any context changes created by the result of any interactions between users, applications, and surrounding computing environment for applications without users, interventions. To achieve this goal, one of the problems is how to continuously monitor/capture and interpret the environment related information efficiently to assure high context awareness by the middleware. Many attentions have been paid to the research of the context-aware pervasive applications. Existing context information that supports service (component) adaptations is provided by the context-aware infrastructure, which gathers, pre-processes and provisions context information from a variety of context information sources. However, the context-aware applications is usually prone to failures and disconnections that negatively impact on the ability of them to adapt (and therefore dramatically impact on their usability). So we should take the Quality of Context (QoC) into account. And the procession of gathering, pre-processing and providing context information must be autonomic to the end users. Therefore, we propose an autonomic quality management middleware to support QoC management based context provision. By this middleware, we can configure different strategies to refinery raw context, discard duplicate and inconsistent context adaptively so as to protect and provide QoS-enriched context information of users to context-aware applications and services.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-0242-5; POD:978-1-4673-0241-8","10.1109/ICCSE.2012.6295288","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295288","Agent;Context-aware;Pervasive;QoC;middleware","Cognition;Computers;Context;Context-aware services;Middleware;Sensors","middleware;mobile computing;quality of service","QoS-enriched context information;autonomic context processing;autonomic quality management middleware;context awareness;context-aware pervasive applications;distributed mobile computing;environment related information;information technology;refinery raw context","","1","","13","","","","14-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is difficult for Computer Science students, who are trained in systematic and logical thinking, to learn about visual aesthetics within the standard Computer Science Human-Computer Interaction curriculum. This paper discusses how we have adopted the Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy as a framework for structuring the learning of visual aesthetics. By breaking down the graphical user interface into its building blocks, students can focus on learning to manipulate the attributes of the respective elements in isolation and see how the changes made contribute to the overall visual aesthetics. Students can then link the isolated elements together to achieve a visually pleasing interface. The benefits of this approach are supported by the results of a survey of our students on their experience.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-0242-5; POD:978-1-4673-0241-8","10.1109/ICCSE.2012.6295358","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295358","GUI;HCI Education;User Interface Design;Visual Aesthetics","Art;Graphical user interfaces;Human computer interaction;Image color analysis;Taxonomy;Usability;Visualization","computer science education;educational courses;graphical user interfaces;human computer interaction","SOLO taxonomy;computer science human-computer interaction curriculum;computer science students;graphical user interface deconstruction;structure of observed learning outcomes taxonomy;user experience;user satisfaction;visual aesthetics learning","","1","","33","","","","14-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tools for ontology extraction from text aim to overcome this problem. We have conducted an empirical study with educators, both from Information Technology (IT) and non-IT domains, where they used current ontology extraction tools to build domain ontologies for their courses from their existing course material.

Usability, privacy, and security were considered in the system in its development stage. For the system evaluations, this system was utilized by the members of a community sports club which promotes marathon training among citizens for three months. As a result, the number of members using the web-based training diary was more than double compared with the number of the members using paper-based training diary. Moreover, each satisfaction level with the three major functions of the system, was three or more out of a five on average score.

This problem becomes worse in technology and science topics, since they are often perceived as cold and difficult subjects to learn. On the other hand, playing is considered funny and engaging, which gives motives to people to do it voluntarily. Moreover, the current increasing use of social networks can represent an opportunity for knowledge and skill development, in particular by enabling students' collaboration and competition. This has led to the idea of exploiting and investigating the appeal and educational potential of serious games in a higher education context, in particular for technology and science topics. This paper proposes mini-games based serious game format targeting in particular higher education technology and science topics, and exploiting advanced web-based and social networking technologies, able to support easy diffusion and user competition/collaboration. We have set-up a client-server based architecture for the implementation of a prototype for a Digital Electronic System BSc course. Preliminary test results show that users have a positive attitude towards the games, as they give an average rating of 4/5 in terms of desirability. Furthermore, it takes 3 times of replays, on average, for users to achieve good scores.

However, this strong specialization limits WSNs reuse both in terms of development as well as in terms of technical results: Every new application scenario requires a new design, development and validation, as well as management skills. This is frustrating for any WSNs user, developer or manager. To reverse this tendency and thus improve the quality of experience and user-friendliness in WSNs, we designed FLEXOR, a sustainable software architecture optimized to support the implementation, rapid prototyping, evaluation, and testing of wireless sensor network applications, that is platform independent and user-friendly. FLEXOR is designed to accommodate many different applications and services for wireless sensor networks and foster code re-usability and cross-platform component re-usability. FLEXOR offers high modularity, well defined interfaces, remote node management functionality as well as run-time module exchange. Finally, the introduction of a unifying way for WSNs development opens to a higher homogeneity and thus to more easy comparison among different solutions.

With software development projects becoming increasingly distributed, it is ever more difficult to have sufficient participants in a usability inspection and to collaboratively learn the techniques. Motivated by these problems, we developed a novel, prototype environment called INspect-World for distributed usability inspection techniques.

Experts' involvement in the evaluation process able to help developers detect usability problem before the game can be used by users. Gathering experts to conduct an evaluation process is not an easy task. This is because experts have their own commitments. To overcome this problem, a tool known as AHP_HeGES was developed to assist in evaluation process. This tool is an online system that can be used by experts to conduct the evaluation process. Evaluation technique used are based on heuristic evaluation, known as Playability Heuristic Evaluation for Educational Computer Game (PHEG) that consists of five heuristics; interface, educational element, content, playability, and multimedia. This research is important to facilitate game developers in identifying elements that need to be improved before the final version is ready to be released.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1655-3; POD:978-1-4577-1654-6","10.1109/iUSEr.2011.6150540","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6150540","interface;multimedia;playability;tool;usability of educational computer game","Computers;Databases;Education;Games;Image color analysis;Multimedia communication;Usability","Internet;computer aided instruction;computer games;expert systems;multimedia systems;teaching;user interfaces","AHP-HeGES tool;comprehensive evaluation technique;content;educational computer game development;educational element;expert involvement;interface;learning process;multimedia;online system;playability heuristic evaluation for educational computer game;teaching process;usability evaluation tool","","0","","8","","","","Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The effectiveness, the usability and capabilities of the R-learning content should be reviewed and verified throughout the practices held in the classroom. It is also very important to check if those authenticated robots have been playing the adequate roles using high quality of educational contents. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the best R-learning practices from kindergarten classes developed by teachers and further provide basic information that is useful in continually developing the R-learning content and teaching-learning models. Two cases from the best R-learning practices were drawn and depicted in detail. The two cases were devised through teachers' voluntary involvement in an R-learning study group after robots were offered to the kindergarten classes. If R-learning can be used easily in everyday classes, it will be really inspiring and encouraging. However, it would be much more beneficial to fully understand the contents and functions of R-learning and create qualified and differentiated R-learning classes. It was suggested that to train teachers and develop and apply educational programs using R-learning at each phase, there needs to be continued interest and support for R-learning study group activities.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0723-0; POD:978-1-4577-0722-3","10.1109/URAI.2011.6145916","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6145916","Early Childhood Education;Early Childhood Teacher Education;Robot-based learning","Educational institutions;Educational programs;Electronic mail;Games;Materials;Robots","computer aided instruction;human-robot interaction;intelligent robots;mobile robots;teaching;user interfaces","KIST;Korea Institute of Science and Technology;R-learning content model;authenticated robots;early childhood education;educational contents;educational programs;intelligent robot platforms;kindergarten classes;national policy;teaching-learning model","","0","","2","","","","23-26 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, learning object-oriented concepts is crucial in undergraduate Computer Science or Information Technology programs. Learning object-oriented programming requires high concentration to understand the whole concepts before embarking on the practical aspect. It could be difficult for some students especially novices. In addition, lecturers might not be able to explain the subject effectively due to many factors. This research aims to justify and investigate more aspects to support the understanding of object-oriented concepts through games. Game is one of the approaches that could attract students' attention and increases their focus in learning object-oriented theory and practice. This paper reports a feasibility study using a controlled experiment that investigated the effect of using games in learning object-oriented programming among Computer Science students. The findings show that learners prefer using game as compared to traditional approach of teaching. Based on the study, we propose a more effective game-based approach to support the students in learning object-oriented concepts and programming.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1531-0; POD:978-1-4577-1530-3","10.1109/MySEC.2011.6140689","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6140689","Game-Based Approach;Goal Question Metric (GQM);Object-Oriented Concepts;Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)","Games;Java;Object oriented programming;Programming profession;Usability","computer aided instruction;computer games;computer science education;object-oriented programming;teaching","game-based approach;information technology program;learning;object-oriented concept;object-oriented practice;object-oriented programming;object-oriented theory;software development;student attention;teaching;undergraduate computer science student","","8","","18","","","","13-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is also a typical of activity that can be costly if mismanaged. Many factors can lead the success and also can cause software project failure. The failure actually can be detected early if we can adopt the concept of risk management and implemented it into software development project. SERIM is a method to measure risk in software engineering, proposed by Karolak [4]. SERIM is based on the mathematics of probability. SERIM uses some parameters which are derived from risk factors. The factors are: Organization, Estimation, Monitoring, Development Methodology, Tools, Risk Culture, Usability, Correctness, Reliability and Personnel. Each factor then measured by some questions metrics and there is 81 software metric questions for all factors. The factors then related and mapped into SDLC phases and risk management activities to calculate the probability (P). SERIM uses 28 probability variables to assess the risk potentials. The SERIM method then implemented to assess the risk of information system development, TrainSys, which is developed for a training and education unit in an organization. The result is useful to determine the low probability of TrainSys project success factor. The result also show the dominant and highest factor need to address in order to improve the quality of process and product of software development.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1382-8; POD:978-1-4577-1381-1","10.1109/ICeEEM.2011.6137821","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6137821","Risk Management;SERIM;assess;failure;probability;risk metric","Measurement;Monitoring;Principal component analysis;Schedules;Software;Software reliability","computer based training;computer science education;information systems;project management;risk management;software development management","SERIM method;correctness;development methodology;education unit;personnel;probability;reliability;risk culture;risk factor;risk management assessment;software development project;software project failure;tools;training;trainsys information system development;usability","","1","","8","","","","27-29 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"IP pooling-based email systems reputation assurance","R. Bocu","Department of Computer Science, Transilvania University of Brasov, Romania","2011 RoEduNet International Conference 10th Edition: Networking in Education and Research","20110822","2011","","","1","6","The endeavour to ensure email servers attain and keep a good reputation on the internet is essential for today's system administrators and companies. This is due to the fact that approximately 90% of nowadays email traffic is represented by purely spam and unsolicited messages. Therefore, email filtering techniques have continuously developed during the past decade. In this context, it can be stated that the reputation of the IP address that routes the server's email traffic is essential and constitutes an important variable of any algorithm that quantifies email systems reputation. This remark can be coupled with the fact that IP addresses that are once detected to send spam or that simply do not comply with good sending practices are marked as âuntrustedâ by email reputation assessment systems on the Internet. Once this has happened, reverting back to a normal state often proves to be a difficult, even impossible challenge. It should also be kept in mind that the IP version 4 address space is virtually depleted and the transition to IP version 6 is still in its early stages. Therefore, it is crucial for any system administration team to use an integrated IP reputation assurance method. This paper introduces the main concepts that are connected to IP reputation and its assurance. Moreover, an integrated email systems reputation assurance method, which is based on IP pooling, is described and its performance and usability are assessed and demonstrated considering a practical setting.","2068-1038;20681038","Electronic:978-1-4577-1235-7; POD:978-1-4577-1233-3","10.1109/RoEduNet.2011.5993695","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5993695","IP address;IP pooling;email system;reputation;unsolicited messages","Algorithms;Databases;Electronic mail;IP networks;Internet;Safety;Servers","IP networks;Internet;unsolicited e-mail","IP address;IP pooling;IP reputation assurance method;Internet;email filtering techniques;email systems reputation assurance;spam messages;unsolicited messages","","1","","24","","","","23-25 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile learning (m-learning) is a learning tool which can be run on mobile devices. Mobile System Analysis and Design (MOSAD) has been developed with the content of a topic from the System Analysis and Design (SAD) course conducted at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP). This paper presents the results of the testings conducted for MOSAD application. A heuristic test involving 5 experts in the area of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) was conducted after the first version of MOSAD was completed to strengthen its functionality and usability. Then, Post Test Quasi Experimental Design (QED) was conducted to 116 UTP second year students who took the SAD course to test the effectiveness and usability of MOSAD after it has been revised. The results show that the students who had used MOSAD (66 out of the 116 students) as their revision tool for answering ten quiz questions performed better the other group of students (50 out of the 116 students) who used traditional methods of revision. The usability test was adopted from Purdue Usability Testing tested on consistency, learnability, flexibility, minimal action and minimal memory load of MOSAD.

It includes desktop systems as well as embedded systems in different devices. Success of a technology simply results from the easiness with which the user can interact with it. If the interface is poor or hard to use then the user will simply ignore the product or the technology. A simple and easy way to use a system doesn't mean that a simple technology is behind such a system, on the contrary, a well advanced technology needed to build it. The most important concepts in HCI are functionality and usability. Services provided usually by a system are called functions. Usability is when a user utilizes the system's functions easily, properly and clearly. Functionality and usability may vary from one system to another. A system is said to be successful if there is a balance between both functionality and usability.

However, the major setback with learning in a mobile device is the limited screen space. The nature of interaction is also different between large and small display, in which text input is found not suitable to be employed on small screen due to the slower text input mechanism. The navigation technique was investigated as a potential technique that could be applied to display information on a mobile device. Navigation technique is based on point-and-click interaction on hierarchical structure of links. In order to determine how well this navigation technique solves the above problems, a prototype for learning Programming C++ was developed and a usability testing was conducted. Due to the existing problems in student understanding in the subject of Programming in C++, this domain was chosen with the hope that students would benefit from the development of this prototype.

All educational activities and resources need to be related to the intended learning outcomes of a learning module or course, in order to assist the learners in successfully achieving the intended learning outcomes at the end of the learning experience. Outcome based assessment means that the assessment process must be aligned with the learning outcomes. This means that it should support the learners in their progress (formative assessment) and validate the achievement of the intended learning outcomes at the end of the process (summative assessment). It also means that the assessment process should be adapted depending on the kind of outcomes that it is aimed to appraise. This paper presents an insight into the current state of outcome based learning within Europe and proposes a unified conceptual model for outcome based assessment, shaping a theoretical framework for the integration of learning outcomes, assessment and units of learning as key concepts.

However, how students should interact with each other is relatively ignored. It is a good idea that students learn within a supportive community in order to feel safe enough to take risks. Cooperative Learning (CL) is a successful teaching strategy in which small teams, composed by students with different skills, use a variety of learning activities to improve their understanding of a subject. Each member of a team is responsible not only for learning what is taught but also for helping his or her teammates learn, thus creating an atmosphere of achievement.

Correspondingly, some aspects of the course projects, such as the business scope and software complexity, grew in proportion to the increase in the project duration. At the same time, a number of ÃÂ¿costsÃÂ¿ were reduced, including the time and effort required to set up the development infrastructure and development environments, and learn new tools and languages. Most importantly, several other factors experienced substantial growth. The longer project duration allowed significant increase in the effort and attention paid to usability engineering and user-centered design, leading to systems that were deployable and more usable for the target users. It also enabled better software testing, deployment and release management. As a result, the final outcome was much closer to production quality than the prototypes and proof-of-concept systems typical of earlier single-quarter projects.","1093-0175;10930175","DVD:978-1-4244-7051-8; Electronic:978-1-4244-7053-2; POD:978-1-4244-7052-5","10.1109/CSEET.2010.41","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5463591","","Business communication;Design engineering;Informatics;Production systems;Software design;Software engineering;Software prototyping;Software testing;Usability;User centered design","computer science education;educational courses;program testing;software engineering;user centred design","business scope;capstone project;development environment;development infrastructure;informatics;production quality;project duration;single-quarter project course;software complexity;software deployment;software design;software development;software engineering;software release management;software testing;undergraduate degree;usability engineering;user centered design","","4","","8","","","","9-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper discusses the heuristic evaluation of a mobile learning prototype for children aged between 10 and 12 years old. It was developed using JCreator LE and Sun Wireless Toolkit 2.5.2 platform software. The prototype consists of learning material from the Science subject that is taught in all primary schools in Malaysia. It focuses on a subtopic relating to Basic Needs of Human. The researchers envisioned that such application can be used as a revision aid that will complement the use of textbooks and workbooks in the classroom learning. The first prototype was evaluated using heuristic evaluation technique with five software ergonomic experts. The evaluation revealed few design issues that should be refined in order to improve its usability before testing it on the real users, the children.

However, realistic VR surgery simulations are in high demand as a result of offering risk-free training environments for physicians. The necessity of realism compels researchers to adopt physics-based models and haptic renderings that place extra computation burdens on real-time rendering pipelines. In this study, we investigate the usability of already built-in physics-based models in physics/or game engine PhysX library, for scooping operations in artificial cervical disc replacement (ACDR) surgery. The motivation behind our work is twofold. First, intricacies involved in ACDR surgery are introduced and the fundamental components towards the development of a surgical simulator are addressed. Second, an on-going framework development is introduced for the scooping action based on the PhysX library which provides optimized and physics-based methods for a plausible simulation.

We present the preliminary findings of 2 user studies of 21 graduate students who engaged in SNA using NodeXL. The majority of students, while information professionals, had little technical background or experience with SNA techniques. Six of the participants had more technical backgrounds and were chosen specifically for their experience with graph drawing and information visualization. Our primary objectives were (1) to evaluate NodeXL as an SNA tool for a broad base of users and (2) to explore methods for teaching SNA.

In Study I (n = 8) it was observed that students treated MRHs as social actors more than students in prior interactions with virtual human patients (n = 27), and used interpersonal touch to comfort and reassure the MRH patient similarly to prior interactions with human patients (n = 76). In the within-subjects Study II (n = 11), medical students performed a clinical breast exam on each of a MRH and human patient. Participants performed equivalent exams with the MRH and human patients, demonstrating the usability of MRHs to evaluate students' exam skills. The acceptability of the MRH patient for practicing exam skills was high as students rated the experience as believable and educationally beneficial.

Thirdly, we considered security, privacy, and usability for the TMS. From the above design specifications, we constructed a prototype TMS composed of a Web server, a Web application, and a database server. A rich Internet application (RIA) was built for the user interface in order to enhance usability. To promote the students' PDSC, the RIA had three functions: a training diary function, a feedback function, and a message board function.

Tangibility of the interface was expected to make the game easier to learn and easier to use than the PC version because it is more direct.The results from our experiment, in which the interactions of children with the physical interface and the screen-based interface were compared, support this.

Pragmatic questions are not the easiest for mathematically inclined computer scientists to address. They refer by nature to people and their habits, sociology, and the day's technological demands. An industrial psychology literature, apart from computing, has sometimes addressed questions of this kind. But this kind of study must become part of programming language theory within computing. It's the importance of just these kinds of questions that makes programmers choose scripting languages.

The main game runs on the teacherpsilas portable PC projected on a large screen, whereas the students will interact with the game using their own mobile phones. Lecture Quiz is a multiplayer quiz game, which offers a variation in game modes where unlimited number of players can play simultaneously. Games like Lecture Quiz are most useful for testing and rehearsing theory. As a bonus, the teacher will get quantitative data on how much of the theory the students actually have learned. The evaluation of Lecture Quiz was performed in a software architecture lecture where twenty students first played the game and then were asked to fill in an evaluation form. The focus of the evaluation was on usability of the system and the perceived usefulness of using Lecture Quiz in lectures. The results of the evaluation show that Lecture Quiz was easy to use and that it contributed to increased learning. Further, Lecture Quiz was perceived as entertaining, and half of the students claimed they would attend more lectures if such systems were used regularly.","1093-0175;10930175","POD:978-0-7695-3144-1","10.1109/CSEET.2008.15","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4556966","Software engineering education;evaluation;game concept;usability","Computer science education;Educational institutions;Educational technology;Games;Mobile handsets;Portable computers;Software architecture;Software engineering;Testing;Usability","computer aided instruction;computer games;mobile computing","Lecture Quiz;lecture game;mobile games;mobile phones;multiplayer quiz game","","14","","23","","","","14-17 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We believe one way to boost the utility of such simulations and animations is to make them easier to use. In this paper, we describe a pen-based interface for constructing weighted and unweighted graphs which functions as a front-end to shortest path and minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm simulators that we have developed. We compare the usability of this pen-based interface to that of a WIMP-based interface and a hybrid interface that uses a mixture of pen-based and WIMP-based input methods. We report evaluation results on the usability of the three types of interfaces that we have developed. Our results show that a purely pen-based approach to graph creation may actually suffer from the relatively higher misrecognition rates of the harder-to-recognize symbols and inhibit usability. We conclude that a hybrid approach which combines a soft-keyboard with graph recognition outperforms interfaces that are purely pen-based or WIMP-based.","","POD:0-7695-2942-9","10.1109/PLT.2007.2","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4488860","","Animation;Application software;Computational modeling;Computer science education;Computer simulation;Ink;Laboratories;Tree graphs;Usability;Web search","computer animation;graphical user interfaces;handwritten character recognition;human computer interaction;keyboards;light pens;trees (mathematics)","WIMP-based PowerPoint-like interface;computer animation;computer simulation;free-hand graph drawing recognizer;graph creation;minimum spanning tree algorithm simulator;pen-based interface usability;shortest path algorithm simulator;soft-keyboard","","0","","5","","","","4-5 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Motivation of the research is to avoid inconsistencies and language problems regarding translation of such terms and nomenclatures in literature textbooks and articles by providing a community of experts by invitation that will create an official and standardized translations. The authenticated users with administrative privileges will add, store and change and overall manage the e-learning dictionary. The primary administrator will grant administrative or reader privileges to learners based on authentication. This kind of approach is based on wiki approach by creating a community of users where unlike the wiki approach will be carefully chosen and granted approach by invitation and privileges will be based on user data validation. The research method was exploratory research to determine the best research design and then empirical research to describe accurately the interaction between the learners and the system being observed. The data were collected through focus groups and surveys, direct or indirect discussions and in-depth communications and interviews with prospective users, as well as with literature review of the experts in the field.

As a first approach, we have developed last year a suture and ligature training system named Waseda Kyotokagaku Suture No. 1 (WKS-1), which is composed by a commercial skin dummy with arrays of embedded sensors designed to acquire quantitative data of the task. The WKS-1 was designed to reproduce realistically the task conditions as well as providing objective assessment of the task performance. In particular, the proposed evaluation function considered the following performance indexes: time, displacement and force levels. By performing experiments with medical doctors and unskilled persons, we confirmed the effectiveness of WKS-1 to provide objective assessments of the task performance. However, the functionalities of WKS-1 were too restricted as few automatic procedures were implemented for the acquisition and processing of the collected data. Therefore; in this paper, we are presenting the Waseda Kyotokagaku Suture No. 2 (WKS-2). The WKS-2 has been designed to provide more detailed information of the task performance as well as improving its portability, connectivity, and usability. In addition, thanks to the design improvements on the WKS-2, we have proposed additional evaluation parameters to measure the quality of the suture (after the task has been completed). For this purpose, we proposed a image processing algorithm to automatically measure the width of sutures, the distance among them and the wound area.

Current composition styles are too professional to those end users when building their own applications. Actually, the end user would prefer rapidly discovering the best-of-breed services to assemble as well as visually personalizing the presentation to enjoy rich experiences. We propose an end user service composition approach for reducing the composition complexity and difficulty from the end user perspective. In our approach, similar candidate services are aggregated together as a unified resource, whose wide QoS spectrum can be easily manipulated by the end users to satisfy their requirements. Then they can personalize the services and, the composition occurs only at the presentation layer. The main contributions of the approach are: (i) enabling the end users to personalize the composite application with more powerful presentation; (ii) supporting the end users to dynamically customize the service composition in terms of QoS; (iii) alleviating the end users from the time-consuming task of selecting service to compose.","0730-3157;07303157","POD:0-7695-2870-8","10.1109/COMPSAC.2007.222","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4291082","","Assembly;Computer science;Computer science education;Educational technology;Laboratories;Mashups;Software reusability;Usability;Visualization;Web and internet services","Web services;quality of service;software architecture;software reusability","Internet;QoS;end user service composition;reusable service;service oriented computing","","5","","12","","","","24-27 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Prediction Mechanism of Adaptive Learning Content in the Scalable E-Learning Environment","C. P. Chu; Y. C.

Adaptive learning feature provides content specific to a student's learning style. Hence, the first step of adaptive learning is to identify the student's learning style and then to determine the appropriate learning content that corresponds to the individual students learning style. This paper proposes a mechanism to predict the adaptive learning content for each student. To prove the usability and availability of the proposed mechanism, this paper implements the proposed mechanism in a scalable e-learning environment. In the scalable e-learning environment, every student can share diverse learning contents distributed in different learning management systems through peer to peer technology. By means of the prediction mechanism, the adaptive learning content can be acquired at the student site in advance of its use. Hence, the waiting time for downloading learning content can be reduced and thus the learning performance is enhanced. Furthermore, the complexity of storage space is decreased since the student only needs to acquire the learning content corresponding to her/his learning style. In addition, this paper also uses the IRIS dataset and real student data to verify the accuracy of the prediction mechanism.","","POD:0-7695-2847-3","10.1109/AINAW.2007.43","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4224242","adaptive learning;e-learning;peer to peer.;prediction mechanism","Accuracy;Computer science;Content management;Education;Electronic learning;Electronic mail;Environmental management;Iris;Space technology;Usability","computer aided instruction;peer-to-peer computing;teaching","adaptive learning;e-learning;learning content;learning management system;peer to peer technology;prediction mechanism;student learning style;teaching quality","","4","","25","","","","21-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An application developed with WebSI is composed of application logic (AL) component and an interaction style (IS) component, containing code for producing and managing the graphical user interface (GUI). In the laboratory the students wrote only the AL component, while the instructor provided a number of ready-made different IS components. If the student didn't like the produced GUI, she could simply exchange the IS component with one that produces a GUI that is more to her liking. The exchange of an IS component is possible since all IS components employ the same abstract semantic interface, which does not specify the geometric and other properties of the GUI to be produced. Changing components is fast, as no compilation is required. The time the students saved by using ready-made IS components was invested in requirement elicitation and specifications, which had a beneficial effect on the usability of the student projects.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0859-8; POD:1-4244-0858-X","10.1109/ITRE.2006.381565","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4266326","Component;Component-Oriented Programming","Application software;Computer science;Computer science education;Costs;Graphical user interfaces;Information technology;Laboratories;Programming;Safety;Software engineering","computer based training;computer science education;graphical user interfaces","GUI;WebSI;application logic;graphical user interface;interaction style component;semantic component interfaces;semantic interface;software engineering training;student training","","0","","14","","","","16-19 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To explore the benefits of narrowing the gap between coding an algorithm and viewing its visualization, we have implemented ""What You See Is What You Code"", a novel, ""radically dynamic"" development model to facilitate learner-constructed algorithm visualizations. In this model, the line of algorithm code currently being edited is reevaluated on every edit, leading to the dynamic update of an accompanying visualization of the algorithm.

Most of all, the customer is integrated into the development process, with constant feedback. This is very similar to usability engineering (UE) which follows a spiral four phase procedure model (analysis, draft, development, test) and a three step (paper mock-up, prototype, final product) production model.

In addition we investigate usability issues. The approach that we have taken for this investigation is through a study that involves students from different university departments who were asked to use both the mobile and standard desktop facilities of an educational system, so that we could compare usability issues among the two modes. As a result most students approved the ''new'' way of interaction with excitement and found mobile facilities useful and easy to use.

In the 2002-2003 academic year, the DLE was implemented during the fall and spring terms in undergraduate geography courses at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). Evaluation of the fall term implementation identified design issues of time and complexity for creating and organizing course domain knowledge. The spring term implementation added new services to integrate course content into class presentation formats. The implementation was evaluated via interviews with the course instructor, development staff, and students, and by observations (in person and videotaped) of the course. Results indicated that usability and functionality for the instructor had increased between the two course offerings. Students found classroom presentations to be useful for understanding concepts, and Web access to the presentations useful for study and review.

We expected MRAS to be widely useful in education settings with little or no modification. In a series of deployments we encountered a surprising range of specific requirements. These included context- and content-specific needs. We ultimately had to shift from an application focus to a platform focus, from a single general-purpose tool to a toolkit to support asynchronous group interaction, with which task-specific applications could be built. Software that can be widely used with little or no modification has advantages for producers and consumers, but our experience suggests that as computer users become more aware of the flexibility of software, general purpose shrinkwrap software may fade away. Requests for MRAS from educators who would likely encounter similar problems suggests that these difficulties are not predictable.

E-learning, which applies the concept of open and distance learning is learning through the Internet. It had been reviewed as an efficient knowledge transfer mechanism. E-learning is seen as a future application worldwide, promoting life long learning by enabling learners to learn anytime, anywhere and at the learner's pace. This paper presents the evaluation of an online test based on a case study of an e-commerce course offered by the Computation Department, University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST). The main aim of the online test is to provide 'rich' feedback to students, which is one of the requirements of the learner-centered learning paradigm. The online test, in the form of multiple choice questions, provides feedback through automatic grading, providing correct answers and referring the students to the learning content which explains the correct answers. Evaluation of the online test was based on two criteria: functionality and usability. In terms of functionality, evaluation was meant to get the students' view of the feedback provided by the system, while in terms of usability, the evaluation sought to ensure that the system not only functions as expected by the users but is also usable. Results show that the online test is suitable for online-learning and provides rich feedback.","","POD:0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265051","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265051","","Communications technology;Computer aided instruction;Continuing professional development;Educational technology;Electronic learning;Feedback;Internet;Knowledge transfer;Testing;Usability","Internet;distance learning;educational courses","Internet;distance learning;e-commerce course;learner-centered e-learning;online assessment;online test;online-learning","","11","","18","","","","5-8 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Depending on the user's skills, learning styles and learning strategies these learning fragments are individually combined to an e-learning system.

While most software developers may have been exposed with basic concepts such as GUI design guidelines, few developers are able to understand the human/user-centered design (UCD) toolbox at a level that allows them to incorporate it into the software development lifecycle. This paper describes an approach for skilling developers and students enrolled in an engineering program in critical user-centered design techniques and tools.

In such framework, online learning is becoming an important tool to allow the flexibility and quality requested by such a kind of learning process. In the recent past, a great number of on-line platforms have been introduced on the market showing different characteristics and services. A series of features should be taken into account when one evaluates e-learning platforms, starting from the function and usability of the overall learning system in the context of the human, social and cultural organization within which it is to be used. Obviously, the analysis of the features of a system is not sufficient: it is also important to understand how they are integrated to facilitate learning and training and what principles are applied to guide the way the system is used. To evaluate them both pedagogical and technological aspects must be carefully evaluated. This paper proposes a model for describing and characterizing on-line learning platform component. The model is then used to evaluate the most known existing commercial platforms.","","POD:0-7695-1874-5","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174342","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174342","","Computer aided instruction;Computer aided software engineering;Cultural differences;Electronic learning;Globalization;Humans;Information technology;Internet;Learning systems;Usability","Internet;computer aided instruction;continuing education","Internet;cultural organization;e-learning platforms;electronic learning;human organization;information-oriented society;learning process;learning system;life-long learning;on-line learning platforms;pedagogical aspects;social organization;technological aspects;training","","5","","30","","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

International Conference on Information Technology: Coding and Computing","20020807","2002","","","95","99","An important parameter in evaluating data hiding methods is hiding capacity (Cohen et al., 1999) i.e. the amount of data that a certain algorithm can ""hide"" until reaching allowable distortion limits. One fundamental difference between watermarking (Cox et al., 1997; 1999) and generic data hiding resides exactly in the main applicability and descriptions of the two domains. In the digital framework, watermarking algorithms that make use of information hiding techniques have been developed and hiding capacity was naturally used as a metric in evaluating their power to hide information. Whereas the maximal amount of information that a certain algorithm can ""hide"" (while keeping the data within allowable distortion bounds) is certainly related to the ability to assert ownership in court, it is not directly measuring its power of persuasion, in part also because it does not consider directly the existence and power of watermarking attacks. We show why, due to its particularities, watermarking requires a different metric, more closely related to its ultimate purpose, claiming ownership in a court of law. We define one suitable metric (watermarking power) and show how it relates to derivates of hiding capacity. We prove that there are cases where considering hiding capacity is sub-optimal as a metric in evaluating watermarking methods whereas the metric of watermarking power delivers good results.","","POD:0-7695-1506-1","10.1109/ITCC.2002.1000367","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000367","","Computer science education;Computer security;Data encapsulation;Distortion measurement;Home computing;Information security;Power measurement;Steganography;Usability;Watermarking","copy protection;copyright;data encapsulation","copyright;data hiding;information hiding;law;metric;watermarking algorithms;watermarking power","","3","","23","","","","8-10 April 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Students relied on a single representation of an algorithm, misinterpreted the limitations and specifics of that representation, avoided using outside media sources and worked primarily within groups to understand algorithms. Thus, algorithm animation may have limited usefulness for this population.

The experimental results expose compatibility in the evaluated expert levels given by the system and the tutor, but they also emphasize the benefits of the system from the pedagogical point of view","","POD:0-7803-7078-3","10.1109/NAFIPS.2001.944704","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=944704","","Automatic testing;Computer aided instruction;Computer science;Distance learning;Fuzzy logic;Iterative algorithms;Java;Prototypes;System testing;Usability","distance learning;educational computing;fuzzy logic;information resources","Java;Web-based distance education;compatibility;distance learning system;evaluated expert levels;fuzzy logic;home learning;linguistic expression;pedagogical benefits;prototype system;software agent;user knowledge evaluation;user testing","","5","","11","","","","25-28 July 2001","25 Jul 2001-28 Jul 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the VC represents an interface between the students and a virtual professor and provides personalized learning materials to the users, the VL offers a possibility to the attendees to share different resources out of time and space boundaries. It enables geographically separated users to effectively facilitate remote access to various, presumably diverse, (real) resources. The VL is implemented with three key points in mind: modularity, reusability and common interface handling. Using the object-oriented approach in the development of the VL service, we made a modular system, capable of managing various resources that can possibly be shared through VL. By using common interfaces that each resource-specific agent must implement, many different resources that possibly have nothing in common can be shared through the same VL service. The first experiments show that users are satisfied with the VL usability. They found VL as a very convenient service within the distance education systems","1530-2067;15302067","POD:0-7695-1251-8","10.1109/TOOLS.2001.941663","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=941663","","Collaborative software;Computer science;Distance learning;Java;Laboratories;Object oriented modeling;Resource management;Usability;Virtual colonoscopy;XML","distance learning;distributed object management;intelligent tutoring systems;object-oriented programming;software agents","DCOM;Virtual Classroom;Virtual Laboratory;agent-based resource sharing;common interface handling;distance education;experiments;modularity;object-oriented approach;personalized learning material;software reusability;usability","","2","","12","","","","2001","29 Jul 2001-03 Aug 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The need to incorporate human-computer interaction (HCI) and especially `usability', into software design and system development is increasingly evident. If industry is to pay more attention to improving the usability of its software and systems, courses need to be established so that students gain knowledge and skills that are important in the real-world and experience realistic situations that address usability issues. To date, the provision of HCI education for practitioners has not been addressed substantively by most Australian universities. The paper describes the course that responds to industry needs. It reviews the course objectives, content resources and some teaching strategies. It also provides insights into problems of conducting courses relating to industry needs and plans for future development of the academic programme","","POD:0-8186-7525-X","10.1109/OZCHI.1996.560002","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=560002","","Application software;Australia;Computer aided software engineering;Handheld computers;Human computer interaction;Process design;Programming;Software systems;Software tools;Usability","business data processing;computer science education;educational courses;human factors;software engineering;teaching;user interfaces","Australian universities;academic response;case study;competitive edge;educational courses;future development;human computer interaction education;human-computer interaction;industry needs;information technology;marketplace;organisations;software design;system development;teaching strategies;usability;user interfaces","","0","","3","","","","24-27 Nov 1996","24 Nov 1996-27 Nov 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

From a pilot study conducted with the purpose of investigating how design and usability issues impact on the mathematics and science teaching-learning process in secondary schools in Mexico, we identify a number of problems that suggest the importance of considering these issues during the implementation of educational technology programs and during the evaluation of its outcomes, as these programs will ultimately determine the development of for example, national curricula and national education policies.","","POD:0-7695-0493-0","10.1109/HICSS.2000.926722","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=926722","","Computer science education;Educational institutions;Educational products;Educational programs;Educational technology;Mathematics;Paper technology;Physics computing;Physics education;Usability","computer aided instruction","Mexico;educational technology;educational technology programs;evaluation programs;national curricula;national education policies;reasoning skills;secondary schools;teaching-learning process;teaching-learning processes;technology-based implementation;usability issues","","0","","15","","","","4-7 Jan. 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Architects' education revolves around the studio course, which promotes: project based work on complex and open ended problems; very rapid iteration of design solutions; frequent formal and informal critique; consideration of heterogeneous issues; the use of precedent and thinking about the whole; the creative use of constraints; and the central importance of design media. M. Kapor (1991) suggested that software practitioners needed to ârethink the fundamentals of how software is madeâ and proposed the architect's role in building design as a fruitful analogy for software professionals seeking to reform software practice. This analogy helps us focus on usefulness, usability, user needs and practices, and other technical and nontechnical aspects of good software design. It highlights concerns about people's lives and work practices and how people âinhabitâ systems.

We have created some helpful tools around the Hartstone program that may be used for a performance evaluation and a rapid analysis of real-time applications. They give the possibility to understand the real-time responsiveness of applications using both real-time and standard operating systems in an uncomplicated way. We distinguish three different methods to compare performance and to check the theoretical results of scheduling analysis. The first is based on finding breakdown utilization points of process sets. The second method inspects the special overload behavior beyond the breakdown utilization point. This observation reveals a very interesting behavior of the system under overload conditions.

The first is a ""hands-on"" lab that utilizes readily available materials. A more ""refined"" lab experience then layers on more detail to the phenomena under discussion, and focuses on data acquisition test and measurement issues.

Research that focuses on the educational needs of workers who are learning to operate database applications is being carried out. Specifically, attention is being given to the problem-solving strategies that users in a workplace employ in complex data retrieval tasks, such as formatting reports, sorting records, selecting subsets of records, and relating records from two or more databases. The investigation has two dimensions: analyzing workers' actual learning styles and cognitive strategies for on-the-job tasks and analyzing the information, knowledge, and conceptual representations required for various types of complex problems. The data obtained are intended to be a starting point for designing content and terminology in user manuals that truly accord with worker's actual processes and language of learning and performance.<<ETX>>","","","10.1109/IPCC.1989.102128","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=102128","","Application software;Associate members;Databases;Employment;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Manuals;Problem-solving;Testing;Usability","computer science education;database management systems;information retrieval;user manuals","cognitive strategies;complex problems;conceptual representations;data retrieval tasks;database manuals;educational needs;learning styles;on-the-job tasks;problem-solving strategies;record relation;record sorting;record subset selection;report formatting;terminology;usability;user manuals;worker performance;workplace strategies","","0","","2","","","","18-20 Oct. 1989","18 Oct 1989-20 Oct 1989","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Companies have higher expectations for degrees in technical communication, a strong foundation in technology, and the ability to function on cross-disciplinary teams alongside technical experts in the design and development process. As the practice of technical communication shifts its focus, academics have the responsibility to be certain that technical communication degree programs have a strong component of such topics as engineering design, programming, human factors, usability, instructional design and project management, in addition to traditional communication skills. Academic programs have lagged behind practice, largely due to the location of degree programs, departmental reward systems, faculty deficiencies in technology, little depth in field beyond rhetoric, and lack of exposure to best industry practices.
