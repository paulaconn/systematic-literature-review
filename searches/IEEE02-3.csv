"Teaching and promoting web accessibility in virtual learning environments: A staff training experience in Latin-America","H. R. Amado-Salvatierra; R. Hernández; J. R. Hilera","GES Department, Galileo University, Guatemala, Guatemala","2014 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE) Proceedings","20150219","2014","","","1","4","Constant evolution of technology triggers a large myriad of research related to accessibility in Virtual Learning Environments (VLE). In the same way, international initiatives provide guidelines to create accessible web content, but educational institutions, especially in Latin-America (LA), are not aware of the VLE barriers that could affect students with disabilities. The fulfillment of accessibility standards in a virtual campus provides benefits for all the academic community that in some cases could face difficulties to learn through the VLE. This work proposes an innovative practice to implement, promote and include accessibility features in a VLE through an intensive training workshop based on best practices. This approach is addressed to technical staff involved in the installation, maintenance and support of e-Learning solutions in academic institutions, with a special focus on software and web engineering. A first staff training experience was implemented in seven countries in LA with more than 180 participants from 52 different Higher Education Institutions (HEI). Results from the experience manifest a growing interest from HEIs in accessibility topics and encourage improving the workshop materials for new editions. The design of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) based on the workshop will allow the initiative to reach a broader audience.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4799-3922-0; POD:978-1-4799-3923-7; USB:978-1-4799-3921-3","10.1109/FIE.2014.7044392","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044392","Accessibility;Training;Virtual Learning Environment;Web Engineering;Web-based Courses;e-Learning","Barium;Three-dimensional displays","Internet;computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational institutions;further education;handicapped aids;software engineering;teaching","HEI;Latin-America;MOOC;VLE;Web accessibility;Web engineering;e-learning solutions;educational institutions;higher education institutions;massive open online courses;software engineering;staff training;students with disabilities;teaching;technical staff;virtual campus;virtual learning environments","","0","","24","","","","22-25 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"STEM collaboration in virtual world academy","L. Divine; R.

However most of the initiatives designed to get students interested in STEM fields are constrained by floor space, budget, or driving distance. These factors, in combination, act to limit the affordability and accessibility of research opportunities in STEM fields to students in schools faced with increasingly limited budgets or lacking access to experienced STEM teachers. Since a trained STEM workforce is crucial to tackling research challenges of importance to the Air Force and the nation, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Discovery Lab program has developed a Virtual Reality Academy (VRA) program utilizing open source virtual reality software, Open Simulator, to create a virtual collaboration environment called Virtual (reality) Discovery Center (VDC). This 16-region VDC is the key to the Discovery Lab's 1,000 Student Outreach initiative designed to greatly expand the Discovery Lab's ability to make project-based “hands-on” research experience accessible to students across the country via the Open Simulator collaboration technologies. This paper highlights many of the successful efforts to establish VDC Virtual Learning Academies in areas such as Biology, Nanotechnology, Computer Vision, and Mobile Computing (smartphone apps). This paper is not a scientific study of Open Simulator as a collaboration tool for STEM but rather a descriptive overview of its successful implementation locally and nationally - suggesting its potential as a game-changer in STEM education and research.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6404-1; POD:978-1-4673-6403-4","10.1109/CTS.2013.6567288","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567288","","Avatars;Collaboration;Dinosaurs;Educational institutions;Solid modeling;Space shuttles","computer aided instruction;engineering education;groupware;public domain software;teaching;virtual reality","16-region VDC;Air Force Research Laboratory Discovery Lab program;Open Simulator collaboration technologies;STEM collaboration;STEM fields;STEM teachers;STEM workforce;VRA program;Virtual Discovery Center;Virtual Reality Academy program;driving distance;floor space;open source virtual reality software;project-based hands-on research experience;science-technology-engineering-mathematics;virtual collaboration environment;virtual learning academies","","1","","6","","","","20-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This fact can be also illustrated on the case of contemporary lack of IT students like in other engineering disciplines. The dynamics of software engineering and the requirement that IT should be widely used in other disciplines imply that IT professional should understand various knowledge domains and skills like but more intensively than in classical engineering disciplines. This ability is sometimes called versatility. It is difficult for teachers to teach it as they are induced to do research being typically fragmented into small research areas. We give examples when IT experts should behave like classical engineers and when software engineering specific skills are needed. An example is the solution of the problem of falling interests of young people to study engineering and science disciplines, software engineering inclusive. The solution of this issue can have the greatest long term impact on engineering education. It can moreover change the rules for the accessibility and analysis of the data collected by e- government systems. We show that it is necessary to apply IT tools to evaluate the quality of schools and education systems by the success on labor market. It can change the attitudes of public to engineering and science education and improve the management of the entire education system.

Unfortunately, the articulation and verification of software system requirements remains one of the most difficult and error-prone tasks in the software development lifecycle. The use of formal methods, based on mathematical logic and discrete mathematics, holds promise for improving the reliability of requirements articulation and modeling. However, formal modeling and reasoning about requirements has not typically been a part of the software analyst's education and training, and because the learning curve for the use of these methods is nontrivial, adoption of formal methods has proceeded slowly. As a consequence, technology transfer is a significant issue in the use of formal methods. In this paper, several efforts undertaken at NASA aimed at increasing the accessibility of formal methods are described. These include the production of the following: two NASA guidebooks on the concepts and applications of formal methods, a body of case studies in the application of formal methods to the specification of requirements for actual NASA projects, and course materials for a professional development course introducing formal methods and their application to the analysis and design of software-intensive systems. In addition, efforts undertaken at two universities to integrate instruction on formal methods based on these NASA materials into the computer science and software engineering curricula are described.","1093-0175;10930175","POD:0-7695-0421-3","10.1109/CSEE.2000.827014","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=827014","","Application software;Educational institutions;Logic;Mathematical model;Mathematics;NASA;Production systems;Programming;Software systems;Technology transfer","aerospace computing;aerospace industry;computer science education;educational courses;formal specification;technology transfer;training","NASA;aerospace industry;case studies;computer science education;discrete mathematics;formal methods;high-quality software;mathematical logic;professional development course;requirements specifications;requirements verification;technology transfer;training","","3","","24","","","","6-8 March 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The online accessibility of open materials will make possible for teachers, students and self-learners to use them for leisure, studies or work. Recent studies have focused on the use or reuse of digital resources with specific reference to the open data field. Moreover, open data can be reused - for both commercial and non-commercial purposes - for uses such as developing learning and educational content, with full respect for copyright and related rights. This work presents a rating system for open data as OER is proposed. This rating system present a framework to search, download and re-use digital resources by teachers and students. The rating system proposed is built from the ground upwards on Open data principles and Semantic Web technologies. By following open data best practices and Linked Data principles, open data initiative ensures that data hosted can be fully connected into a Web of Linked Data. This work aims at sharing good practices for administrative/academics/researchers on gathering and disseminating good quality data, using interoperable standards and overcoming legal obstacles. In this way, open data becomes a tool for teaching and educational environments to improve engagement and student learning. Designing an open data repository that manages and shares information of different catalogues and an evaluation tool to OER will allow teachers and students to increase educational contents and to improve relationship between open data initiatives and education context.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5467-1; POD:978-1-5090-5468-8; USB:978-1-5090-5466-4","10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7943089","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943089","component;formatting;insert (key words);style;styling","Context;Education;Government;Portals;Tools","Linked Data;computer aided instruction;open systems;semantic Web;teaching","OER;Web of Linked Data;digital resource downloading;digital resource re-use;digital resource search;digital resources;educational content;educational environments;interoperable standards;knowledge-based economy;learning content;online accessibility;open data resources;open materials;open-data repositories;rating system;semantic Web technologies;student engagement improvement;student learning improvement;teaching environments","","","","","","","","25-28 April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Within these courses, students need to perform signal measurements on real hardware utilizing expensive and professional equipment. This implies that it would be advantageous for all students (full-time, part-time & distance learning) having access to the real hardware and the necessary equipment. Due to OPES (One Platform for Every Student) it is ensured that students are equipped with embedded platforms. In order to develop their skills at home, proper measurement equipment is mandatory. Therefore, the tools to complete the exercises and assignments need to be available 24/7 to all students. To address this need of access to measurement equipment outside the university, a suitable toolkit is necessary. This toolkit should be affordable for the university to increase the availability of measurement equipment for every student. Furthermore, it should provide adequate functions and features to ease the successful completion of exercises and assignments. Finally, the toolkit should be scalable to ensure the integration of further functions and features. The hardware and software design should be available to the open-source community as well. This paper describes the development of a low-cost, open-source oscilloscope which has the potential to solve these problems and closes the lack of access. Hence, this paper gives an overview of the oscilloscope architecture, the signal processing unit, and the graphical user interface.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5467-1; POD:978-1-5090-5468-8; USB:978-1-5090-5466-4","10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7942842","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7942842","Embedded Platforms;Measurement Equipment;Open-Source;Signal Processing","Graphical user interfaces;Hardware;Open source software;Oscilloscopes;Probes;Signal processing;Voltage measurement","computer aided instruction;educational courses;electronic engineering education;embedded systems;graphical user interfaces;oscilloscopes;public domain software;signal processing","OPES;embedded systems courses;graphical user interface;hardware design;measurement equipment;one platform for every student;open-source community;open-source oscilloscope;oscilloscope architecture;professional equipment;signal measurements;signal processing unit;software design;technical university programs;undergraduate courses","","","","","","","","25-28 April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Meanwhile, in recent years, websites have undergone radical changes regarding design, development, and construction. Responsive design is a new trend that has a strong impact on web design. To determine blind users' experience with responsive design, the authors performed empirical tests to investigate the impact of responsive design on the emotions of blind users during web interactions. They measured user emotions by applying the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) instrument. Results show that although the responsive websites investigated had acceptable levels of accessibility, they posed numerous usability barriers and triggered intense, negative user emotions. Furthermore, the average number of negative emotional reactions for blind users was higher in the case of responsive web design than in the case of nonresponsive web design.","1070-986X;1070986X","","10.1109/MMUL.2017.21","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7924277","HCI design and evaluation methods;Internet/Web technologies;accessibility;blind user;healthcare;mobile;multimedia;software engineering;usability;user experience","Education;Guidelines;Internet and Web services;Market research;Medical services;Software engineering;Usability;Web design","Web design;handicapped aids","PANAS instrument;accessibility guidelines;blind users;positive and negative affect schedule instrument;responsive Web design","","","","","","","","Apr.-June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This educational paradigm is of paramount importance for society nowadays, because expands access opportunities to education at all levels. These learning environments can take advantage of Open Educational Resources. Using OER is a growing trend and it is turning into a recommendation by some governments and international education forums. Nevertheless, in spite of the availability of OER websites, quite a few of them do not consider accessibility design principles, therefore these websites present access barriers for users with disabilities. Besides, only a reduce number of these websites offer accessible resources, i.e. digital contents suitable for users with disabilities. On the other hand, in web environment, findability is a design consideration that improves the user's searchable experience by simplifying the location and acquisition of elements in websites. In this restricted scenario, findability of educational resources is a key issue for users with disabilities. In this research, we address the issue of findability of Open Educational Resources (OER), from the perspective of inclusive participation of users with disabilities, by considering three aspects: web accessibility, some usability best practices oriented to users with disabilities and Information Architecture.

The OER movement has tended to define “openness” in terms of access for use and reuse to educational materials, and to address the geographical and financial barriers, between students, teachers and self-learners with distinguished educational institutions. MOOC initiatives emphasize free access and interactive features rather than static content. The dominant message is of the quantity of access rather than the openness of educational resources for use, re-use, adaptation or repurpose. The purpose of this paper is to present the main aspects to considerer building a framework based on semantic web technologies to support the inclusion of open materials in massive online courses and significantly to improve discovery, accessibility, visibility, and to promote reuse of open educational content in massive courses. This framework will provide a set of services that allows the discovery and access of open educational resources that are extracted from open repositories distributed.

These courses are known by the generic name of Geo-MOOCs. A MOOC is an online course that is open to the general public for free, which causes a massive registration. A GIS is a computer application that acquire, manipulate, manage, model and visualize geo-referenced data. The goal of a Geo-MOOC is to expand the culture of spatial thinking and the use of geographic information, enabling geospatial web technologies for widespread use. However, the Geo-MOOCs, by nature, have inherent problems of accessibility. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), Article 24, recognize the right of persons with disabilities to education. “States Parties must ensure that persons with disabilities are able to access general tertiary education, vocational training, adult education and lifelong learning without discrimination and on an equal basis with others” [1]. Therefore, it is important to have accessible Geo-MOOCs. In this paper, we present the results of the evaluation of a Geo-MOOC called “Maps and the Geospatial Revolution” using three tools available for free on the Internet: Chrome Developer Tools - Accessibility Audit, eXaminator and WAVE; and included a selection of web content and geographical data representative of the course. This provided feedback for establishing recommendations to improve the accessibility of the analyzed course.

However, recent developments in embedded systems have enabled more powerful and portable processing units capable of analyzing complex data streams in real time. Systems with such capabilities are able to perform tasks such as 3D visual localization and tracking of targets. They are also well-suited for environmental monitoring using a combination of cameras, microphones, and sensors for temperature, air-quality, and pressure.

Tablets and iPads, which are prevalent, can be utilized with dementia patients in portraying favorite music and family photographs via apps developed in close partnership with geriatric facilities. Anecdotal research has shown that non-verbal late-stage dementia patients have become stimulated when iPods played their beloved tunes. There is an unmet need in geriatric facilities for stimulating dementia patients, as well providing hard-core data for proving increased cognitive abilities with technology. Technology can help bridge the gap between patients and staff to improve the quality of life for the cognitively impaired. This study addresses cognitive functioning and quality of life for people diagnosed with dementia via technology. In recent times, the influx of older adults suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia related illness has impacted the U.S. Healthcare system. Cognition significantly declines in older adults with AD or dementia over the course of the disease, causing most to be dependent on caregivers, thus routinely institutionalized. Caregivers are often required to focus their attention on addressing the agitation or discomfort of the AD or dementia patient. Research has shown that technology instruments such as iPods, help stimulate those with dementia. This study focuses on innovative devices such as iPads and tablets, which are mainstream and easy to use, cannot only help determine stage of dementia, but also provide stimulation to improve cognitive functioning. It is hoped that this research will analyze that specially created apps and existing assistive software can be used to decrease the symptoms and improve cognition of older adults suffering from AD or other dementia related diseases. Via service-learning courses, students developed an easy-to-use application for tablets to help- older adults with disabilities more readily use the technology. Student programmers produced apps and performed usability tests with the dementia patients, as well as met with geriatric facility personnel to produce application software that meets the patients, family, and caregiver needs and expectations. For example, a student term project produced an application entitled Candoo that utilizes Google's voice recognition and synthesis engine to navigate the web, provide the weather, and supply pill reminder alerts. Another application example included one that allows families to electronically send photographs, video clips, and favorite music from anywhere to loved ones for enjoyment. Furthermore, older adults were assessed by nursing students for cognitive functioning before, and after the semester's intervention. Such mobile apps could allow dementia persons to become less agitated and stay in their homes longer, while also providing awareness and positive change of attitude by those of another generation towards the elderly. This research will discuss student developed mobile applications in the scope of helping improve the quality of life of patients with AD or dementia.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6245-0; POD:978-1-4673-6244-3","10.1109/LISAT.2013.6578252","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6578252","Accessibility;Aged User;Assistive Technologyies;Computer Science Education;Elderly;Older Adults;Senior Citizen;Software Engineering;Sundowning","Animals;Dementia;Mobile communication;Sociology;Statistics;Tablet computers","cognition;diseases;geriatrics;handicapped aids;mobile computing;patient treatment;speech recognition;speech synthesis","AD;Alzheimer patients;Candoo;Google voice recognition;Google voice synthesis engine;US healthcare system;caregiver anecdotes;cognitive abilities;cognitive functioning;geriatric facilities;iPads;iPods;mobile app development;music;nonverbal late-stage dementia patients;older adults;photographs;service-learning courses;student programmers;tablet application;usability research;usability tests;video clips","","5","","19","","","","3-3 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Establishing a Teaching and Learning Center (TLC) is an increasingly frequent process for achieving these goals. Such centers offer various programs for the promotion of teaching and learning in academic institutions. This article examines the factors that influence the significant role played by TLC in an institution, and the effectiveness of its curricula.

Existing motion recognition techniques are not easy to apply to the smartphone directly, since it has limited resources compared to the desktop or notebook computer. But, smartphones have an advantage over any other computer, since smartphones are equipped with various sensors including orientation sensor and acceleration sensor. Nowadays, smartphones have various input ways to communicate with user through text, image or QR code and user's motion. Also, smartphones are able to communicate and exchange data with other electronic devices using Wifi or Buletooth technique. It gives lots of possibilities to offer convenience to consumers and one of examples is smartphone can be used as an input devices or a remote controller for home appliances. It will be particularly helpful to elders or disabled persons since the phone is the closest to person than any other electronic device on the current human life style. To develop better application software as a remote controller operated by user's motion, the motion should be investigated and analyzed trajectories of smartphone to get dynamic characteristics of user's actions. In this research, three different periodic motions such as tilt, zooming in-out and swing were studied by analyzing trajectories of a smartphone using outputs of orientation sensor and acceleration sensor. The result of our experiment shows that the average one period time of three motions is 1.88±0.07sec while one period time for three motion are 1.84sec for tilt, 1.98sec for zoom in-out and 1.81sec for swing. The result of additional experiment of additional two motions shows that two motions' one period time are within the range of three motions'. At the current stage, the result shows that stereotype of hand motion's one gesture is about 1.9sec, but it needs further research to reconfi- m. However, the stereotype of hand motion's one gesture means that any repetitive hand motion using smartphone could be utilized as one of input way, such as motion of moving up-down and moving right-left. Furthermore, if the motion shows a periodic aspect, user does not need to wait until sensor is stabilized or calibrated at the initial operating stage. The result of this research will be applied to the universal design or barrier free design of home appliances to give better accessibility and convenience to everybody including elders and handicapped persons.","","Electronic:978-89-94364-18-6; POD:978-1-4673-1326-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6418692","design for all;guide line;human-smartphone-interface;motion analysis;stereotype","Acceleration;Character recognition;Home appliances;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Mobile communication","domestic appliances;gesture recognition;product design;production engineering computing;smart phones;user interfaces","Bluetooth technique;QR code;Wi-Fi;acceleration sensor;barrier free design;dynamic characteristic analysis;electronic device;home appliance;human smartphone interface;image code;motion recognition technique;orientation sensor;periodic motion;remote controller;smartphone trajectory;swing motion;text code;tilt motion;universal design;user hand-motion;wireless fidelity;zooming in-out motion","","0","","11","","","","27-29 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is primarily due to the high cost and lack of accessibility to imaging and tracking systems. We provide a software and data infrastructure which addresses both challenges. Our infrastructure allows students, patients, and clinicians to develop an understanding of the key technologies by using them, and possibly by developing additional components and integrating them into a simple navigation system which we provide. Our approach requires minimal hardware, LEGO blocks to construct a phantom for which we provide CT scans, and a webcam which when combined with our software provides the functionality of a tracking system. A premise of this approach is that tracking accuracy is sufficient for our purpose. We evaluate the accuracy provided by a consumer grade webcam and show that it is sufficient for educational use. We provide an open source implementation of all the components required for a basic image-guided navigation as part of the Image-Guided Surgery Toolkit (IGSTK). It has long been known that in education there is no substitute for hands-on experience, to quote Sophocles, “One must learn by doing the thing; for though you think you know it, you have no certainty, until you try.”.

Although we are surrounded by the products of engineering in our everyday lives, students often do not understand the importance of the engineering profession. Research strongly connects engineering to mathematics and science skills but does not associate engineering with problem solving, creativity, or the positive impacts on the world. It is disturbing to see how few young students understand the relevance and excitement of engineering. In the United States, there is a danger of having an insufficient supply of creative, young innovators for the future. It is important to give the next generation of engineers the ability to tinker, explore, and experiment with relevant world topics, such as renewable energy, infrastructure, improved transportation, and medical care. By combining the knowledge and tools of today, students can understand the importance and constraints of the problem and find an engineering solution. Today, educators face limitations in delivering these relevant challenges to students in an affordable and accessible manner. Educators want to provide a hands-on learning experience to empower students while improving the comprehension of fundamental concepts. Traditional tools and techniques are either too expensive for a school to afford or the size makes accessibility to the system a challenge. In this paper, we demonstrate how to give students the ability to gain experience with the relevant challenges using graphical system design and student-owned instrumentation hardware. Through systems like the NI myDAQ miniGrid, students can understand the concepts of renewable energy and sustainability and reinforce topics like solar power and power distribution with systems that fit into the palm of their hand and cost less than $99 USD. The low-cost systems are currently in high schools and universities for the spring 2012 semes- er.

This is partly due to the accessibility to education, ICT technologies and the development of infrastructure was a bit late by the remote communities in Borneo. Therefore, the possible source of historical data is through oral tradition, which is have limited trace only to several generations back. In order to preserve their cultures and beliefs, a thorough study on remote communities is required in order to present a precise software architecture that can represent their cultures and beliefs in digital form. This paper will discuss the elicitation process and techniques on remote community cultures which related to marriage process, including preparations, events and beliefs before and during the marriage ceremony.

Existing processes for student's and faculties' vital data collection require a great deal of labor work to collect, input and analyze the information. These processes are usually slow and error prone, introducing a latency that prevents real-time data accessibility. We propose a solution to automate this process by using “documents” attached to existing faculty/ student datasheet that are inter-connected to exchange service. The proposal is based on the concepts of utility computing and cloud computing networks. The information becomes available in the “cloud” from where it can be processed by expert systems and/or distributed to administrative staff. The proof-of-concept design applies commodity computing integrated to legacy education devices, ensuring cost effectiveness and simple integration. In the presented paper, author suggests that IT also have a stronger role in software realization of an expert system.

On the other hand, it is often the case that simulation platforms do not provide the students an adequate, in-depth understanding of concepts (such as synthesis on FPGAs). In this short paper, a third option - a remote FPGA Laboratory - is illustrated. This option uses software to allow students and researchers in geographically distributed locations to remotely access a pool of 64 Xilinx ML-310 Boards over the Internet. To the best of our knowledge, a remote FPGA facility of this kind is unique. The infrastructure described here gives remote users the ability to dynamically power on/off the FPGA boards, upload/download files, configure the boards online and execute synthesized designs while sending input and output through the Internet. Advantages include considerable savings in space, greater accessibility for users, ease of maintenance, and the ability to better schedule resources.","","POD:0-7695-2940-2","10.1109/FCCM.2007.53","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4297290","","Costs;Ethernet networks;Field programmable gate arrays;Internet;Laboratories;Network servers;Switches;Universal Serial Bus;Web server;Workstations","computer aided instruction;electronic engineering computing;electronic engineering education;field programmable gate arrays;student experiments","Internet;geographically distributed location;physical laboratory room;remote FPGA laboratory education;resource scheduling;simulation platform;software infrastructure;substantial floor space","","8","1","5","","","","23-25 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Software and devices designed to aid the vision impaired are unable to decipher most images and visual- centric objects contained in e-learning materials. This paper discusses a project undertaken over the past two years to modify the content and presentation of Cisco certification e-learning courses to enable accessibility by vision impaired and blind students. These modifications necessitated rewriting the learning materials so they could be effectively presented via multi-modal user interfaces to vision impaired students, involving speech, audio, haptics and force-feed devices and methods.

The tool assessment included interviews of both students at the undergraduate and graduate level and faculty. The interview was a set of specific questions chosen to document each participant's experience and impressions of utilizing SOPPTS. Data evaluation consisted of compiling the reoccurring themes during the interview process. The major themes that emerged are the increased efficiency in developing, recording and tracking of student project plans, the visibility and immediate accessibility of this information and the improved and timely communication among the student team members, faculty and client partners. With the improved access to information and facilitated communication through SOPPTS, the project planning and tracking skills for the software development teams improved. Moreover, the informal aspects of team communication and synergy, factors that can be as important as the technical aspects, were enhanced.","1093-0175;10930175","POD:0-7695-1869-9","10.1109/CSEE.2003.1191376","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1191376","","Computer science;Design engineering;Documentation;Educational products;Feedback;Job shop scheduling;Programming;Project management;Software engineering;Software systems","computer science education;planning;project management;software engineering","Ball State University software engineering classes;Student Online Project Planning and Tracking System;automated tracking;communication;data evaluation;faculty;graduate level;interviews;online guidance;online system;project planning requirements;project tracking requirements;real-time feedback;recording;student project progress;tool assessment;undergraduate level","","3","","10","","","","20-22 March 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the courseware is being developed, the type of delivery system that will be used to present the material in a classroom must be decided. Some of the Studio's experiences and difficulties using a dedicated multimedia classroom are detailed. This setup is compared with a portable display system that can be used in a conventional classroom. The Internet is becoming a valuable resource and an integral part of today's educational environment. Setup procedures that the studio had to follow to become connected to the World Wide Web are outlined. In addition, instructions on how to access the NEEDS database via the WWW are given. Suggestions on how to avoid problems between high-powered authoring tools and database accessibility by potential users are explored.

The system is comprised of a module to diagnose a student's background mathematical knowledge and modules to which the student is directed to remedy any deficiencies that are found. The remedial modules focus on common areas of weakness in mathematics and revise the basic mathematical tools that are needed by business students. For example, there are currently nine modules of which three deal with numbers, graphs and the solution of equations. With the use of multimedia facilities incorporating colour and animation, the system can be perceptually more varied, more interesting and easier to use than existing print based information. For maximum accessibility and ease of implementation, the software was designed to run in a Windows environment using the authoring language Asymetrix “Multimedia Toolbook”. The system is run and administered on the University's Novell network, but the developed software can be readily distributed and run independently of the network. This allows the software to be used off-campus, and makes the system equally accessible to students who are studying by distance education, open learning or who are located on an overseas campus","","POD:0-7803-3173-7","10.1109/MMEE.1996.570255","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=570255","","Distance learning;Econometrics;Education;Environmental economics;Equations;Mathematics;Multimedia systems;Software design;Software testing;Software tools","computer aided instruction;computer animation;computer science education;multimedia systems","Asymetrix;Novell network;Windows environment;animation;authoring language;background mathematical knowledge;business students;distance education;learning problems;mathematical tools;open learning;overseas campus;quantitative methods;software delivered diagnostic and remedial system","","0","","7","","","","3-5 Jul 1996","03 Jul 1996-05 Jul 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
