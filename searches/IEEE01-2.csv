It represents a major conceptual shift that introduces new elements in programming models and development environments that are not present in traditional technologies. The evolution of Cloud Computing motivates teaching Cloud Computing to computer science senior students and graduate students so that they can gain broad exposure to the main body of knowledge of Cloud Computing and get prepared for occupations in industry. There is thus a strong need for having a Cloud Computing education course that (i) has a broad coverage of different roles interacting with a cloud; and (ii) leverages Cloud Computing concepts, technology and architecture topics at both introductory and advanced level. In this paper, we describe the demand for understanding the impact of Cloud Computing in computer science higher education. We propose education strategies for teaching Cloud Computing, including key knowledge areas for an enduring Cloud Computing course.","1093-0175;10930175","Electronic:978-1-4799-4970-0; POD:978-1-4799-4969-4","10.1109/CSEET.2014.6816778","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816778","","Architecture;Business;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Education","cloud computing;computer science education;educational courses;further education;teaching","IT resources;cloud computing education course;cloud computing education strategies;cloud computing teaching;computer science higher education;computer science senior students;delivery platform;graduate students;services consumption","","0","","35","","","","23-25 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Besides, the variable of great number of programs by which the learner can use the sets without the need of software programs. These programs are formulated and equipped on the computer which to be used by the learner. This development has led to appearing the term “Cloud Computing” which depends on transferring the process operation and save spaces of the computer to modems and work platforms connoted through internet without obstacles related to a specific computer or place. The appearing of “Cloud Computing Service” in the world of technology has helped not only to save and manage and organize the information and files but also assists to keep the works connection through the internet. In addition to that, “Cloud Computing Service” is the best solution for many technical problems related to the damage or loss of the documents and files. Besides, The “ Cloud Computing Service” offers the infrastructure, services, programs through net which offers attractive advantages to the higher education institutions. It also has the ability to decrease the cost of information technology and communication in suppositional environment within the current operation system to be able to test the system as if it is the program as other programs that can be faced at any time. The significance and justifications of this paper are as follows: ▪ The lack of Arabic researches in the field of “ Cloud Computing Service”. ▪ The need to study the term of “Cloud Computing Serv- ce” and its components, and the services of Cloud Computing systems. ▪ The plan to join the educational institutions in the “Cloud Computing” and the basics of approving the educational institutions and its applications and the benefits of engaging the “Cloud Computing Service” in the educational process.","","CD:978-1-5386-2224-7; Electronic:978-1-5386-2225-4; POD:978-1-5386-2226-1","10.1109/ICCA-TICET.2017.8095301","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8095301","Cloud computing;internet;public cloud;web","Cloud computing;Education;Google;Information technology;Modems;Web 2.0","","","","","","","","","","1-3 Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is one that faces numerous challenges in terms of the effective management when introducing a change for pedagogical practice that involves the ubiquitous use of computing and ICT against a global user base that is influenced by known and unknown barriers to technology adoption. It is suggested that that with a history of organizational change considerations being a pre-dominantly strategic business related construct, and technology related change being a predominantly project managed or service model construct, that a traditional CM or project approach may not adequately address many barriers to technology adoption. As has occurred in other business/IT related interactions such as the Information systems strategy triangle, learning using technology requires a clear marriage of the technological managerial and pedagogical domains. Organizational, Business, IS, and education strategy all need to interact synergistically in order to move forward with technology use for education. The purpose of this project was to conduct a study that focused on the broad context of technology barriers faced by students using technology around a Moodle based online learning environment. The underlying objective was to examine the interaction between change management activity and student perceptions of both technology barriers and change focusing on encouraging the adoption of technology for learning. The project created and presented a typical open source Moodle based virtual Learning Environment (VLE) in a BYOD situation, to a group of 35 second year university students in the form of activities and a quantitative and qualitative survey of the barriers and interactions.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1560-3; POD:978-1-5090-1561-0","10.1109/IACC.2017.0156","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7976890","E-learning;HEI context;Technology Adoption;change Management","Analytical models;Business;Context modeling;Education;Guidelines;Mobile communication;Tools","Bring Your Own Device;Internet;computer aided instruction;further education;management of change;public domain software","BYOD situation;HEI context;Moodle based online learning environment;change management guidelines;open source Moodle based virtual learning environment;organizational change considerations;project managed construct;service model construct;strategic business related construct;technology adoption;technology enhanced learning;technology related change","","","","","","","","5-7 Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The popular-priced and portable open source hardware is used as a bridge between CACSD tools and real plants to deliver the control and sensor data at the sampling time points. Ten I/O function blocks written in C code are developed based on the CACSD tool employed for the proposed light-weight RCP system in order to handle I/O operation in a simple way. In addition, we suggest two practical strategies, a batch transfer strategy and a variable sampling period method, to increase the sampling rate of the control system. It is shown through experiment that the proposed light-weight RCP system works well up to a sampling rate of 2 kHz without adopting expensive hardware and C code generators. It is expected that the proposed RCP system will be considered as affordable and readily available to schools for mass education.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2715184","10.13039/501100002635 - Inha University Research Grant; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7947098","Arduino due;block libraries;high-speed USB interface;rapid control prototyping (RCP)","Control systems;Open source hardware;Real-time systems;Software packages;Tools;Universal Serial Bus","C language;control system CAD;parallel processing","C code;I/O operation;PC-based CACSD;USB interface;batch transfer strategy;computer-aided control system design;computing control;data transfer;high performance computing;input and output operation;light-weight RCP system;light-weight rapid control prototyping system;off-the-shelf open source hardware;variable sampling period method","","","","","","OAPA","20170613","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Broad teaching strategies, methods and tools are developed over the years to address this concern. In recent years, with the increasing numbers of students accessing the internet using mobile devices, there has been growing interest in embracing the mobile technology in teaching to improve the student participation in the classroom. This research describes the design and implementation of a mobile-based interactive teaching model with in-class and off-class components aided by Socrative online audience response system to improve students' engagement in a private university in Malaysia. A total of 45 students from undergraduate computing course had participated in this experimental study. The activities such as polls, exercises, quizzes and games was used to stimulate the discussion and encourage two ways communication between instructor and students. Both qualitative and quantitative data comprises of students' feedbacks, academic results, attendance records and instructor's teaching evaluation scores are analyzed. The results show that students were strongly positive with the use of Socrative and felt that they were more engaged. This interactive model has successfully enhanced students' learning experience and improved students' academic performance.

Cultural and higher education institutions in Scotland, in common with those in the rest of the world, are investing vast resources on digitization and making their collections available online but we still know very little about who uses these and how they interact with the data. In order to address this gap the Scottish Network on Digital Cultural Resources Evaluation. ScotDigiCH was initiated in January 2015 and brings together academics from different disciplines and professionals from Scotland's key cultural organizations in order to investigate how cultural digital resources are used by diverse user groups, how to record their impact on learning, research, and community engagement, and how to maximize their potential. It integrates different methodologies and perspectives (from digital humanities, computing science, museology, social sciences) and uses as a case study the Kelvin Hall Project in Glasgow. The Network has organized a series of four workshops, a knowledge exchange event and will organize an international symposium on digital cultural resources evaluation combined with a public lecture and an open public event to explore the Kelvin Hall digital collections portal. All these activities have certainly given all partners a lot of food for thought and are informing the Hunterian museum's Digital Strategy and how it takes digital curation, collections documentation, exhibition interpretation and visitor engagement forward. The paper discusses the methodology and lessons learned from the ScotDigiCH research network and the wider implication for other researchers and organizations working in digital cultural heritage.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8993-8; POD:978-1-4673-8994-5","10.1109/VSMM.2016.7863188","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7863188","digital collections;evaluation in digital cultural heritage;impact of digital resources;value of digital resources","Conferences;Crowdsourcing;Cultural differences;Global communication;Kelvin;Organizations;Social network services","further education;history;social networking (online)","Kelvin Hall digital collections portal;ScotDigiCH network;Scottish network;collections documentation;cultural heritage;cultural institutions;digital cultural resources evaluation;digital curation;exhibition interpretation;higher education institutions;visitor engagement","","","","","","","","17-21 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Healthcare data are however very complex and difficult to manage. This is as a result of the astronomical growth of healthcare data, the high speed at which these data are generated as well as the diversity of data types in healthcare. The capturing, storage, analysis and retrieval of health related data are rapidly shifting from paper based system towards digitization. However, the vast volume as well as the complexity of these data makes it difficult for the data to be processed and analyzed by traditional approaches and techniques. Consequently, technologies such as cloud computing and virtualization are now gradually used for processing massive data effectively and securely in healthcare. Hence, the healthcare system is swiftly becoming a big data industry. Thus, this paper examines the concept of big data in healthcare, its benefits and attendant challenges. This paper revealed that the fragmentation of healthcare data, ethical issues, usability issues as well as security and privacy issues are some of the factors impeding the successful implementation of big data in healthcare. This paper therefore suggests that ensuring security and privacy of healthcare data, the adoption of a standardized healthcare terminology, education strategy and the design of usable systems for processing large volumes of data are some of the ways of successfully implementing big data in healthcare.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4171-8; POD:978-1-5090-4172-5","10.1109/FTC.2016.7821747","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7821747","big data;healthcare;information and communication technology","Big data;Biomedical imaging;Cloud computing;Databases;Google;Medical services;Security","Big Data;health care","Big Data;data complexity;data diversity;education strategy;healthcare data privacy;healthcare data security;healthcare system;standardized healthcare terminology","","","","","","","","6-7 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The College of Computing and Informatics at UNC Charlotte-comprised of three departments with an undergraduate enrollment of approximately 1,500 students-is a large research institution in an urban setting with a diverse student population. Within this unique context, the project aim is to build a sustainable practice of educational innovation across the undergraduate computing curriculum by increasing faculty awareness of teaching innovations, resources for pedagogical change, and support for teaching practices that engage students. The vision is to create an active learning environment that transforms the student entering the computing undergraduate program from a person with an interest in computing to a person with an affinity identity [1] as a computing professional through these ongoing connections. We employ a systems theory of change for the Connected Learner based on two foundational concepts: flipped classrooms and engagement theory. To achieve related goals of improving student retention and time to graduation, Connected Learner teaching strategies are being integrated across the undergraduate curriculum with an initial focus on introductory gateway courses. Change is occurring via infrastructure supports to sustain learning practices across our college through faculty development initiatives (hiring, training, mentoring, and incentives) that are designed to inform faculty about engagement pedagogies, motivate faculty to adopt these practices, and shift pedagogical attitudes. During the first year of the five-year project, quantitative and qualitative data from students and faculty was collected and analyzed. This data provides a baseline of student attitudes and performance as well as a baseline of faculty attitudes and teaching practices.

"Academics' experience of teaching Open Ended Group Projects: A phenomenographic study","M. Voogt; Chuan Sheng Chen; N. Thota","Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, Sweden","2016 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","20161201","2016","","","1","7","An Open Ended Group Project (OEGP) is a distinguishable pedagogical tool, used by teachers in computing, engineering, and information technology courses. The tool contributes to the development of `soft' skills essential for students' future career needs. This paper reports on a phenomenographic study that investigates the research question: What are the ways in which academics teaching Open Ended Group Projects experience teaching the course? Previous studies, using the phenomenographic research approach, have offered insights into academics' conceptions of science learning and teaching. However, there are no studies that investigate the experiences of teachers who use OEGP in their classes. This is the first study, that asks academics using an OEGP how they experience teaching these courses. Students enrolled in a course on computing education research conducted the small-scale study at Uppsala University, Sweden. In order to answer the research question, a theoretical sample was selected with a wide range of relevant population characteristics (e.g. background, prior experience, gender, and age). The semi-structured interview questions focused on understanding of OEGP, the learning objectives of OEGP, strategies for teaching these learning objectives, and the teacher's experience in teaching through OEGP. The results indicate that teachers see their role within OEGP as a coach and that the variation between experiences lies in what is intended to be coached. This variation is presented in a hierarchy (the outcome space). Categories focus on: the team, discipline, problem solving skills, learning and motivation. We also look at the first-hand experience of a student in an OEGP course and discuss the teachers' perceptions of students' experiences of OEGP. The implication for teaching is that a teacher needs to reconsider the way he or she teaches more often in OEGP than in regular courses. There are two reasons for this. First, teaching OEGP is based less on- teaching content knowledge and more on teaching skills. Secondly, OEGP deals with a `real problem', and aspects of the problem continuously change. Teachers are recommended to aim for reaching a higher category, indicating a deeper level of experience, and to use the experience of coaching OEGP in other courses as well. The importance of metacognition (reflection on action) and discussion with other teachers who have experience in teaching OEGP is highlighted.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1790-4; POD:978-1-5090-1791-1","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757474","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757474","Open Ended Group Project (OEGP);phenomenography;teaching experience","Collaboration;Context;Data analysis;Education;Engineering profession;Information technology;Interviews","computer science education;educational courses;engineering education;teaching","OEGP;Sweden;Uppsala University;academics experience;computing courses;computing education research;engineering courses;information technology courses;metacognition;open ended group projects;pedagogical tool;phenomenographic study;teaching skills","","","","","","","","12-15 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In general, these games do not allow students to create agile process models or experiment with process improvement strategies. We are creating a serious game that will serve as a virtual learning environment to allow students to explore agile process improvement practices. Our game is designed as a single-player game where the player takes the role of software team leader and plays against an AI (artificial intelligence) opponent representing the customer's interests and needs. Players are rewarded for developing project strategies that allow for completion of projects on time, within budget, and meet the necessary software quality requirements.

This demand requires engineers with specialized skills and knowledge. For this, the higher education institutions are developing training strategies aimed primarily at lectures and laboratory practices. However, these strategies are insufficient for the development of technical and social skills required by engineers. In addition, currently there is a lack of a common framework to facilitate teaching-learning process and achievement of learning objectives. In this paper, the authors present a proposal for representation of teaching and learning practices about embedded systems, which have been oriented to track and encourage competency development. The proposal is based on the SEMAT kernel as universal framework for representing software engineering practices, defining an extension to such kernel. In addition, a methodology is proposed with a practical approach for creating theories related to computing, this methodology is used to define an extension of the SEMAT kernel for another discipline domain. In this paper, a first form of general representation of teaching and learning practices about embedded system is proposed. The proposal includes the minimum elements that should have any practice of teaching and learning about embedded systems, and the extension mechanisms to represent specific elements.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1074-5; POD:978-1-5090-1075-2","10.1109/CONISOFT.2016.15","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7477909","SEMAT kernel;embedded system;learning;practice;teaching","Education;Embedded systems;Kernel;Proposals;Software engineering;Stakeholders","embedded systems;further education;teaching","SEMAT kernel;competency development;embedded systems;higher education institutions;laboratory practices;learning practices;lectures;social skills;software engineering practices;teaching-learning process;universal framework","","","","32","","","","27-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this article, we intend to outline our approach to supporting personalized learning strategies by constructing dynamical student profiling using ubiquitous computing capability. This profiling includes recorded data on students' affective responses to learning to discern students' level of motivation and details from generic student profiles to describe and predict student learning patterns. Learning pattern data analysis derives conclusions using decision trees. Through this process, information can be extracted from students' affective responses and students' profile data and relevant correlations between the two data sets can be recognized automatically. A personalized learning component uses this information to offer proactive support to students. This is achieved by recommending personalized courses of action which are beneficial to students.

STEM careers have been noted as particularly discouraging to professionals, especially women, for work/family concerns among other reasons. However, little research has explored the work/family attitudes of prospective professionals in these careers. This paper explores the work/family attitudes of graduate students in computing. Based on data from the Computing Research Association's (CRA) Center for Evaluating the Research Pipeline (CERP) 2011-12 nationwide survey of 1286 computing graduate students, our analysis explores at the aggregate and by sex, the connections between graduate computing education, work/family issues, and career expectations. The analysis of the data reveals work/family issues are important to those in advanced education planning careers in the field. Computing graduate students are strongly influenced by work/family issues in their decision-making regarding advanced computing education. Graduate computing students report high levels of knowledge of work/life strategies and express confidence about their abilities, and their likelihood, for balancing work and family. These findings should help graduate educators and prospective employers concerned with diversity understand the work/family concerns of computing students and future computing professionals.","","Paper:978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344176","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344176","computing careers;computing education;gender in computing;work/family attitudes","Aggregates;Education;Engineering profession;Knowledge engineering;Optimized production technology;Pipelines;Planning","computer science education;gender issues","STEM career;computing education;computing graduate student;professional career;work-family attitude;work-family conflict","","","","28","","","","21-24 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So far, we have reported on mentoring methods that support women of color, as well as a unique enactment of activism by women of color in computing. (We define activism as volunteer work in which women engage for the purpose of increasing diversity in the field.) Such activism is an example of a strategy in which women use their own agency to increase opportunities for others like them, a strategy we have found in other disciplines also indirectly supports their own success. What is not fully understood are the many ways women of color act directly, using their own agency to create success for themselves. These agentic strategies are the focus of our current analysis, the strategies they use rather than those enacted upon them by others. In this paper, we present findings from our interviews with women computing students and professionals of color, who describe their approaches, often inspired by those who teach, mentor and even challenge them. Among the most compelling findings are those strategies women employ when they witness the successes and failures of others, and are inspired to try new things.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0151-4; POD:978-1-5090-0152-1","10.1109/RESPECT.2015.7296497","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7296497","agency;computing;gender;minority;race;women of color","Color;Education;Engineering profession;Image color analysis;Interviews;Navigation;Organizations","educational computing;knowledge based systems","CBDB;agentic strategies;computing education and careers;knowledge base;women of color","","","","35","","","","13-14 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach complements traditional classroom teaching strategy by incorporating live project demonstrations on multi-core, hands on training on parallel programming, practical code dependency analysis task, think pair-share activity and open discussions on research issues in multi-core computing. Survey results show that 69% (approx.) of the students who attended the ACt-PBL lecture perceived that the lecture method encouraged them to think reflectively on the topic compared to only 36% of students from the traditional lecture. Analysis of assessment results show that the ACt-PBL methodology, being easily adaptable to the students' individual needs, has reduced the failure rate of students by approximately 50% vis-à-vis the traditional method. Using this method, a statistically significant (p=0.006) better learning outcome was obtained for freshmen when compared to their counterparts in the traditional lecture class. In contrast this method did not make any significant difference for the sophomores (p=0.74), who had higher prior knowledge than freshmen.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5141-8; POD:978-1-4799-1651-1","10.1109/T4E.2013.13","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6751052","Multi-core computing;active learning;collaborative learning;multi-threading;parallel programming;project based learning","Collaboration;Educational institutions;Parallel processing;Parallel programming;Programming profession","computer based training;computer science education;educational institutions;multiprocessing systems;parallel programming;student experiments","ACt-PBL lecture;ACt-PBL methodology;active collaborative PBLbased teaching methodology;adaptive approach;classroom teaching strategy;freshmen;hands-on-training;learning outcome;lecture class;lecture method;live project demonstrations;multicore computing;pair-share activity;parallel programming;practical code dependency analysis task;student failure rate;students individual needs;university education","","0","","13","","","","18-20 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While investigation of metacognitive strategies used by students is now an established research topic within Computer Science and Information Technology education, the study of personal epistemology is relatively undeveloped. This is so despite there being significant epistemological issues associated with learning the subject itself, such as those concerned with the way in which programming exercises change from convergent to divergent problems, or the process by which software project management problems very quickly become ill-defined. In this paper, we describe a preliminary investigation into the personal epistemology of two cohorts of computing students. We review some models of personal epistemological development and describe an empirical study in which we investigated the dimensions of epistemological beliefs of two cohorts of computing students. The results show that there appears to be a wide range of epistemological belief amongst computing students. Finally, we make some observations about the importance of personal epistemology for learning in Computer Science and outline further work in this area.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4673-5261-1; POD:978-1-4673-5259-8; USB:978-1-4673-5260-4","10.1109/FIE.2013.6684941","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6684941","epistemological beliefs;ill-structured problems;learning;personal epistemology","Computer science;Context;Educational institutions;Knowledge acquisition;Loading;Psychology","computer science education;human factors;philosophical aspects","Computer Science education;Information Technology education;computing students;epistemological beliefs;epistemological issues;knowledge perception;learning;metacognitive strategy;personal epistemological development;programming exercises;software project management problem","","1","","33","","","","23-26 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The participants of this study included 15 elementary, high school and college level teachers who are also graduate students from a master program in engineering. As part of the workshop participants developed a learning activity that included a set of learning objectives, the design of computational thinking related activities considering appropriate pedagogical strategies, and the integration of mechanisms to evaluate students' performance. Here we describe (a) how participants embodied the CS Principles in the design of learning activities to be integrated into their classrooms, (b) how they used the backwards design process as a tool to implement elements of the CS Principles and (c) what is teachers' performance in integrating CS Principles to the design of learning activities as evidenced by their peer evaluations.

Research shows digital goods are superior in terms of minimizing the use of energy and CO2 versus their physical counterparts, including physical activities (e.g, travel). But dematerialization of goods comes with challenges. One of them is security. Various (educational, military, government and medical) institutions have been reluctant in adopting the full dematerialization of their specific goods (medical records, and classified military and government information) and delivery of services because of Cyber adversaries. Transmitting sensitive data for these organizations is, hence, as important as national security.

There were used the concepts of content analysis in social science: content units (delivered information blocks), record units (key features worth to be recorded and checked) and frequency units (associated with repetition to enforce learning and trustful evaluation). The authors collected and processed a broad range of experimental data in an instructional case study for education in electrical engineering: computer networking as a diverse learning collection of materials and methods, driven by modern certification services.

Information technology plays a major role in the future of education, as they break geographical barriers and make educational content widely available. Knowledge collaboration is possible by creating virtual classrooms by interconnecting lecturers to geographically scattered students. Making educational material, such as tutorials and recorded lectures, available worldwide through high-storage infrastructures. Digitalizing and making books available through high-storage infrastructures. But this E-learning system requires huge investment for high-storage infrastructure. Some educational organizations and research institutes cannot afford expensive investments. On the other hand, in most of the organizations, there are large amounts of underutilized computing power and storage existing. Data Grid connects underutilized secondary storage of machines and provides huge secondary storage. It enables resource sharing among the geographically distributed users and resources. Therefore the institutes which do not have sufficient budget can make use of Data Grid efficiently. In this paper we have presented that how Grid computing can be used for inexpensive collaborative E-learning. Data replication increases availability, reliability of data and allows fast access to data. Replication reduces bandwidth consumption and congestion over communication line. Therefore replication is the major issue in Data Grid. Replication strategies determine when and where to create a replica of the data. A good replication strategy should ideally minimize file access time, reduce network congestion and minimize job execution time to improve performance of Data Grid. We strongly believe that the technological revolution that the grid is about to bring will definitely change the way that people dea- with information and, ultimately, knowledge. In this sense, grid computing and e-learning form a perfect match.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0726-1; POD:978-1-4577-0725-4","10.1109/ICTEE.2012.6208636","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208636","Computational grid;Data Replication;Data grid;Grid computing","Bandwidth;Collaboration;Distributed databases;Electronic learning;Grid computing;Reliability","courseware;electronic publishing;grid computing;groupware;information retrieval;knowledge management;reliability;resource allocation;software performance evaluation","bandwidth consumption reduction;communication line congestion reduction;data access;data availability;data grid performance improvement;data reliability;data replication;educational content;educational material;educational organizations;electronic books;file access time minimization;geographically distributed resources;geographically distributed users;geographically scattered students;grid computing;high-storage infrastructures;inexpensive collaborative e-learning;information access;information technology;job execution time minimization;knowledge collaboration;knowledge sharing;network congestion reduction;research institutes;resource sharing;secondary storage;unused resource exploitation;virtual classrooms","","1","","19","","","","3-5 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While direct load control of end-use loads has existed for decades, price driven response programs are only beginning to be explored at the distribution level. These programs utilize a price signal as a means to control demand. Active markets allow customers to respond to fluctuations in wholesale electrical costs, but may not allow the utility to control demand. Transactive markets, utilizing distributed controllers and a centralized auction, can be used to create an interactive system which can limit demand at key times on a distribution system, decreasing congestion. With the current proliferation of computing and communication resources, the ability now exists to create transactive demand response programs at the residential level. With the combination of automated bidding and response strategies, coupled with education programs and customer response, emerging demand response programs have the ability to reduce utility demand and congestion in a more controlled manner.

In the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra (ISEC), Department of Electrical Engineering, preference was given to apply methods integrating technology in the learning and then evaluating the outcomes. Problem-based learning (PBL) was used as an instructional strategy of active learning, and adapted for use in the Lighting Design course. The students are presented with a virtual scenario, quite similar to the real world, where they are required to perform as they would in a real life situation. The emphasis is given to PBL so that they can learn to become autonomous, skilled and explore their own potential as well as improve team work skills/spirit and that can be applied to a wide range of students and subject matters. PBL is introduced to the students as a `learn by doing' project. The project incorporates aspects of electrical engineering and computing skills. This study analyses the learning process/techniques that help students deal with the complexity of a Lighting Design Project and assesses its effectiveness and impact on the students. Essentially, it encourages them to be in charge of their education. The benefits of PBL in the Lighting Design course are visible in the improvement of the study and analysis of a Lighting Design project. The method may also bring benefits for Electrical Engineering programmes where educators struggle for improved teaching and learning.

It also helps bridge the gap between knowledge production and its use whenever academics become involved with open source development contrary to the proprietary model where software is produced within the confines of commercial vendors R&D labs. However in higher education, open source has not broken through the bottom of the software stack where it is confined to fulfilling mostly system computing requirements. At the application and visible level, open source adoption is hampered by a number of factors chief amongst these is the lack of reliable ICT governance structures. The problem is exacerbated in developing country contexts where governance in general is subjected to the power-play between several actors of the higher education scene. The governance conundrum faced by open source adoption in developing countries is illustrated through a detailed case study of an open source project failure at GNU, an American-style university in the Gulf region. The rise and fall of GNU open source project is discussed within a general framework of ICT and open source governance in developing countries higher education sector.

The present work differs from previous methods which aim at minimizing the number of input viewpoints while ensuring full coverage of a specific object. Our work analyzes the visibility for a set of views captured by a linear camera array, and can be extended to a set of images from a 2D camera mesh.

In the fall of 2007, we implemented this approach in a pre-CS1course by requiring students to present their solutions to five course programming projects in face-to-face review sessions. Interview and observational data collected in this course pointed out several practical and logistical problems surrounding the face-to-face review sessions that diminished their educational effectiveness. To address these problems, we describe the preliminary design of a novel asynchronous Web-based project review system to support and augment face-to-face studio-based review sessions.","1943-6092;19436092","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2529-7; POD:978-1-4244-2528-0","10.1109/VLHCC.2008.4639098","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4639098","","Computer science;Computer science education;Educational programs;Feedback;Learning systems;Peer to peer computing;Programming profession;Switches;Systems engineering education;Visualization","Internet;computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;programming;reviews","asynchronous Web-based project review system;computer programming learning;computer science learning;computing education;face-to-face studio-based review sessions;pre-CS1course;studio-based learning","","0","","5","","","","15-19 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to generate a test paper automatically, a modified genetic particle swarm optimization (GPSO) is presented, in which the values of parameters will be decreased linearly with the number of iterations for improving the late convergence rate. For the implementation of GPSO based on multi-agent system, a core agents TPAgent (TPA) is provided to undertake the operations of GPSO and will control the evolution operations of each generation of population. To keep communication between different nodes at a minimum cost, fitness evaluation tasks are implemented by the TPAgents at local nodes, only the local minimum fitness and the corresponding best particle are sent to center node so as to get the global best particle in the parallel computing environment. For avoiding the prematurity, the global best particle will be dispatched to remote node randomly. Based on the JADE, a prototype system is setup , and the simulation results show that the proposed approach is feasible and robust.","1089-778X;1089778X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1823-7; POD:978-1-4244-1822-0","10.1109/CEC.2008.4631085","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4631085","","Area measurement;Automatic testing;Communication system control;Convergence;Distance learning;Genetics;Intelligent systems;Multiagent systems;Particle swarm optimization;System testing","computer aided instruction;distance learning;genetic algorithms;multi-agent systems;parallel processing;particle swarm optimisation","GPSO;JADE;MAS;PSO;TPA;TPAgent;Web-based distance education;Web-based test;agent-oriented design;genetic particle swarm optimization;intelligent test paper generation;learners' knowledge;multi agent system;parallel computing;particle swarm optimization","","6","","9","","","","1-6 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are many standards defining how to search, evaluate, acquire, share, and use this kind of resource by instructors, students, and automated software processes. Aiming to explore the learning-object paradigm, it was modeled, built, and tested a learning-object database that is part of a collaborative environment, which supports distance learning of computer programming languages. One of the available standards was adopted, the learning object metadata standard - LOM. In order to build and manipulate the learning-object database, some strategies showed to be necessary and thus they were defined. This paper presents an adherence analysis of the LOM standard, considering the development of a learning object repository.

Broadband wireless technologies are increasingly gaining popularity by the successful global deployment of the wireless personal area networks (Bluetooth-IEEE 802.15.1), wireless local area networks (WiFi- IEEE 802.lln), and wireless metropolitan area networks (WiMAX- IEEE 802.16). New ICT and e-Learning strategies and advances in wireless standards and technologies- particularly in the areas of Bluetooth, WiFi (wireless fidelity), WiMAX (worldwide interoperability for microwave access) and mobile computing can help to bridge the digital divide in education and research. Using open broadband Wireless technologies and implementing mobile computing architectures, one can overcome the challenges of ground, infrastructure, and finance to increase access; deploy broadband quickly and cost-effectively to areas currently not served; and extend the benefits of digital revolution to previously unreachable populations. These technologies aim to provide low-cost, high-performance Wireless access to residential and business applications. As technology evolves to address portable and mobile applications, the required features and performance of the system will increase. Evolution toward the phase called ""full mobility"" provides incremental support for low latency, low packet loss and real-time handoff of subscriber terminals operating at high speeds. This paper presents the analogy of promising wireless technologies on different frequencies: Bluetooth, WiFi, and WiMAX. This paper is organised into four parts: part I describes the functionality and usage of Bluetooth in the wireless personal area networks, part II presents the WiFi- IEEE 802.1 In strategies for users considering higher-bandwidth alternatives to existing wireless personal area networks, part III discusses how the WiMAX is used as a current standard for Wireless data transmission tec- hnology, which is optimized to deliver high, bursty data rates to mobile subscribers, and to support real-time multimedia and Voice over IP (VoIP) applications, and part-TV explores how these emerging Wireless technologies differ from one another.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-2846-5; POD:0-7695-2842-2","10.1109/AUSWIRELESS.2007.27","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4299663","Bluetooth;WiFi;WiMAX.","Bluetooth;Electronic learning;Explosives;Frequency;Internet;Metropolitan area networks;Mobile computing;WiMAX;Wireless LAN;Wireless personal area networks","Bluetooth;Internet telephony;broadband networks;mobile computing;multimedia systems;wireless LAN","Bluetooth;Internet;Voice over IP;WiFi;WiMAX;broadband wireless technologies;e-Learning;mobile computing;multimedia application;ubiquitous computing;wireless data transmission;wireless local area networks;wireless metropolitan area networks;wireless personal area networks","","21","","11","","","","27-30 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such environments consist of network applications and services. Good interactive response time is crucial to their success. Slow responses can quickly dissuade teachers and learners alike from investing their time in the use of these services. Responsiveness timings taken across 155 Mb/s IP/ATM networks have exposed traditional monolithic server performance as the main bottleneck in interactive response time. A strategy of providing bigger and faster monolithic server hardware in response to each occurrence of system slow down is not a good solution as it is expensive and inflexible. Cluster computing has proven a successful and cost effective alternative to conventional supercomputing and it would now seem to be appropriate to investigate its application to the problem of high performance network service provision. In order to research this issue a replicated resolute architecture has been designed to harness the combined power of multiple independent computers.

To support practical lectures in an OSs course, instructors may adopt an OS on which students can work, exercising their knowledge and enhancing their practical skills. In this context, we present Nanvix, a new OS designed to address this use in undergraduate OSs courses. We introduce a flexible assignment-based teaching methodology for our OS, and we assess the effectiveness of this methodology by applying it in the OSs course of the Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais. When using Nanvix, the average score of the students in the course increased in 11.2%, and the failure rate dropped 47.7%. Moreover, we observed that with Nanvix students got more motivated and interested in the OSs field.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3590-2; POD:978-1-5386-3591-9","10.1109/SBESC.2017.33","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8116579","Assignments;Operating Systems;Teaching Methodology","Documentation;Education;Hardware;Kernel;Schedules","","","","","","","","","","6-10 Nov. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the accumulated calling and computing of SMT solvers are time and resource consuming. This paper presents TsmartLW, an alternate static analysis tool in which we implement a path constraint solving engine to speed up reachability determination. Within the engine, typical types of constraint-patterns are firstly defined based on an empirical study of a large number of code repositories. For each pattern, a constraint solving algorithm is designed and implemented. For each program, the engine predicts the most suitable strategy and then applies the strategy to solve path constraints. The experimental results on some well-known benchmarks and real-world applications show that TsmartLW is faster than some state-of-the-art static analysis tools. For example, it is 1.32× faster than CPAchecker and our engine is 369× faster than SMT solvers in solving path constraints.

Li","School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China","IEEE Access","20171122","2017","5","","24344","24352","In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing relay networks with in-phase and quadrature imbalances and full-duplex relay station (RS), how to optimize pilot pattern and power allocation using the criterion of minimizing the sum of mean square errors (Sum-MSE) for the frequency-domain least-squares channel estimator has a heavy impact on self-interference (SI) cancellation. First, the design problem of pilot pattern is casted as a convex optimization. From the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions, the optimal analytical expression is derived when source and RS powers are given or fixed. Second, under the total transmit power sum constraint of source node and RS, an optimal power allocation (OPA) strategy is proposed to further alleviate the effect of Sum-MSE. Simulation results show that the proposed OPA performs better than equal power allocation (EPA) in terms of Sum-MSE, and the Sum-MSE performance gain increases with deviating <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$rho $ </tex-math></inline-formula> from the value of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$rho ^{o}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> minimizing the Sum-MSE, where <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$rho $ </tex-math></inline-formula> is defined as the average ratio of the residual SI channel gain at RS to the intended channel gain from source to RS. For example, the OPA achieves approximately 5-dB signal-to-noise ratio gain over EPA by shrinking or stretching <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$rho $ </tex-math></inline-formula> with a factor 4. More importantly, the more <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$rho $ </tex-math></inline-formula> decreases or increases, the more the performance gain becomes significant.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2766703","Foundation of Cloud Computing and Big Data for Agriculture and Forestry; Open Research Fund of National Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Environment, China Research Institute of Radiowave Propagation; Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China; open research fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8085119","Full-duplex;IQ imbalances;pilot optimization;power allocation;relay","Channel estimation;OFDM;Radio frequency;Relay networks (telecommunications);Resource management;Silicon","","","","","","","","","20171026","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our system produces reasonable animated constructions of Chinese brush paintings with minimal or no user intervention. We test our algorithm on a range of input paintings with varying degrees of complexity and structure and then evaluate the results via a user study.

"Neuroadaptive Control With Given Performance Specifications for MIMO Strict-Feedback Systems Under Nonsmooth Actuation and Output Constraints","Y. Song; S. Zhou","Key Laboratory of Dependable Service Computing in Cyber Physical Society, Ministry of Education, School of Automation, Chongqing University, Chongqing 400044, China.(e-mail: ydsong@cqu.edu.cn)","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","","2017","PP","99","1","12","This paper studies the prescribed performance tracking control problem for a class of multi-input multi-output strict-feedback systems with asymmetric nonsmooth actuator characteristics and output constraints as well as unexpected external disturbances. By combining a novel speed transformation with barrier Lyapunov function, a neural adaptive control scheme is developed that is able to achieve given tracking precision within preassigned finite time at prespecified converging mode. At each of the first $n-1$ steps of backstepping design, we make use of the radial basis function neural networks to cope with the uncertainties arising from unknown and time-varying virtual control gains, and in the last step, we introduce a matrix factorization technique to remove the restrictive requirement on the unknown control gain matrix and its NN-approximation, simplifying control design. Furthermore, to reduce the number of parameters to be online updated, we introduce a virtual parameter to handle the lumped uncertainties, resulting in a control scheme with low complexity and inexpensive computations. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated by systematic stability analysis and numerical simulation.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2766123","Graduate Scientific Research and Innovation Foundation of Chongqing; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Technology Transformation Program of Chongqing Higher Education University; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8107500","Given performance specifications;input saturations;matrix factorization technique;multi-input multi-output (MIMO) strict-feedback systems;output constraints;speed transformation.","Adaptive control;Artificial neural networks;Control design;MIMO;Nonlinear systems;Symmetric matrices;Uncertainty","","","","","","","","","20171114","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, our objectives are to achieve the tracking control of multi-point temperature, ensure the global temperature uniformity, and enhance the system adaptivity for deviation of the temperature detecting position in the microwave heating system with the input constraints. Therefore, a multirate simple adaptive control strategy based on almost strictly positive real (ASPR) conditions is proposed, which multirate sampling and lifting technique is used to solve the case that the system has less inputs than outputs.

However, these storage systems usually adopt the same replication and storage strategy to guarantee data availability, i.e., creating the same number of replicas for all data sets and randomly storing them across data nodes. Such strategies do not fully consider the difference requirements of data availability on different data sets. More servers than necessary should thus be used to store replicas of rarely-used data, which will lead to increased energy consumption. To address this issue, we propose an energy-efficient storage strategy for cloud datacenters based on a novel hypergraph coverage model. According to users’ requirements of data availability in different applications, our proposed algorithm can selectively determine the corresponding minimum hyperedge coverage, which represents the minimum set of data nodes required in the datacenter. Hence, some other data nodes can be turned off for the purpose of energy saving. We have also implemented our proposed algorithm as a dynamic runtime strategy in a HDFS based prototype datacenter for performance evaluation. Experimental results show that the variable hypergraph coverage based strategy can not only reduce energy consumption, but can also improve the network performance in the datacenter.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2017.2723004","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National program of international S&T cooperation; 10.13039/501100000923 - Australian Research Council; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100006606 - Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7968334","Energy saving;cloud datacenters;data availability;hypergraph;minimum <italic xmlns:ali=""http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/"" xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"">K</italic>-coverage","Algorithm design and analysis;Cloud computing;Distributed databases;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Energy storage;Heuristic algorithms","","","","","","","","Traditional","20170704","Dec. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The resubmission based strategy has an advantage in resource utilization, while the replication based strategy can reduce the task completed time in the context of fault. However, few researches take these two techniques together for fault-tolerant workflow scheduling, especially in Cloud systems. In this paper, we present a novel fault-tolerant workflow scheduling (ICFWS) algorithm for Cloud systems by combining the aforementioned two strategies together to play their respective advantages for fault tolerance while trying to meet the soft deadline of workflow. First, it divides the soft deadline of workflow into multiple sub-deadlines for all tasks. Then, it selects a reasonable fault-tolerant strategy and reserves suitable resource for each task by taking the imbalance sub-deadlines among tasks and on-demand resource provisioning of Cloud systems into consideration. Finally, an online scheduling and reservation adjustment scheme is designed to select a suitable resource for the task with resubmission strategy and adjust the sub-deadlines as well as fault-tolerant strategies of some unexecuted tasks during the task execution process, respectively. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on both real-world and randomly generated workflows. The results demonstrate that the ICFWS outperforms some well-known approaches on corresponding metrics.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2017.2687923","Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002729 - Anhui University; 10.13039/501100005240 - Changjiang Scholars from the Ministry of Education; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7887706","Cloud systems;Fault-tolerant;imbalance;replication;resubmission;workflow","Algorithm design and analysis;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Context awareness;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Scheduling algorithms","","","","","","","","Traditional","20170327","Dec. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For each class, we first model the characters of images within the same class using Gaussian mixture model (GMM). We then represent each image by calculating the Euclidean distance and relative Euclidean distance between the image and the GMM model for each class. We concatenate the representations of each class for joint representation. In this way, we can represent an image by not only considering the visual contents but also combining the class-specific characters.

This is in sharp contrast to another approach that forces students to take a passive rote-learning strategy. To promote active learning, CityU Hong Kong adopted the so-called discovery-enriched curriculum (DEC) pedagogical approach to enhance student learning at the tertiary education setting. While various curriculum design and instructional methods have been explored in recent years, an effective way to assess students' novel discoveries and creativity remains a great challenge. This paper investigates into a relatively new text analytics computational approach to facilitate instructors of identifying and assessing the concrete evidences of students' achievements under a DEC-based pedagogical approach. In particular, we illustrate a topic modeling-based text mining method which can extract the hidden intents and creative ideas of students embedded in their project work. According to our best knowledge, this is one of the few successful research work of applying a topic modeling method to enhance the assessment of students' achievements under a DEC pedagogical approach. The practical application and implications of our work is that educational practitioners can apply the proposed computational method to facilitate the assessment of students' novel discoveries.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2761-7; POD:978-1-5386-2762-4; USB:978-1-5386-2760-0","10.1109/UMEDIA.2017.8074123","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8074123","","Computational modeling;Conferences;Knowledge discovery;Manganese;Noise measurement;Probabilistic logic;Text mining","computer aided instruction;data mining;educational administrative data processing;educational courses;further education;multimedia computing;text analysis","CityU Hong Kong;DEC pedagogical approach;active learning;computational method;contemporary instructional design methods;curriculum design;discovery-enriched curriculum pedagogical approach;important pedagogical approach;instructional methods;passive rote-learning strategy;relatively new text analytics computational approach;sharp contrast;student learning;tertiary education setting;text mining approach;text mining method;topic modeling method","","","","","","","","1-4 Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Power Efficiency and Delay Tradeoff of 10GBase-T Energy Efficient Ethernet Protocol","X. Pan; T. Ye; T. T. Lee; W. Hu","State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","20171018","2017","25","5","2773","2787","In this paper, we study the power efficiency and delay performance of the burst mode transmission (BTR) strategy for the IEEE 802.3az energy efficient Ethernet (EEE) protocol. In the BTR strategy, the Ethernet interface goes to sleep once its transmission buffer becomes empty and wakes up as soon as the first arrival has waited for time r or the N-th frame arrives at the interface. Based on the number of arrivals during the vacation time, a new approach is proposed to analyze the M/G/1 queue with vacation times that are governed by the arrival process and the r and N parameters of BTR strategy. Our key idea is to establish the connection between the vacation time and the arrival process to account for their dependency. We first derive the distribution of the number of arrivals during a vacation time based on an event tree of the BTR strategy, from which, we obtain the mean vacation time and the power efficiency. Next, from the condition on the number of arrivals at the end of a vacation period, we derive a generalized P-K formula of the mean delay for EEE systems, and prove that the classical P-K formula of the vacation model is only a special case when the vacation time is independent of the arrival process. Our analysis demonstrates that the r policy and N policy of the BTR strategy are compensating each other. The r policy ensures the frame delay is bounded when the traffic load is light, while the N policy ensures the queue length at the end of vacation times is bounded when the traffic load is heavy. These results, in turn, provide the rules to select appropriate r and N. Our analytical results are confirmed by simulations.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2017.2703928","Open Research Fund of Key Laboratory of Optical Fiber Communications (Ministry of Education of China); 10.13039/501100001809 - National Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7936512","EEE protocol;Ethernet;IEEE802.3az;M/G/1 queue with vacations;P-K formula","Delays;EPON;IEEE 802.3 Standard;IEEE transactions;Power demand;Protocols;Radiation detectors","IEEE standards;local area networks;protocols;queueing theory","10GBase-T energy efficient ethernet protocol;BTR strategy;IEEE 802.3az;M/G/1 queue;burst mode transmission strategy;power efficiency;traffic load","","","","","","Traditional","20170531","Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The only limitations at this stage are the materials available for the manufacture of components and prototypes on 3D printers. Traditional manufacturing processes like fabrication and machining are still sometimes required to complete projects. This has seen a greater demand and workload for traditional machine shops and trades people. Some of the manufacturing work has to still be completed by skilled experienced trade's people but some of the simpler less complex machining and fabrication tasks could be easily completed by unskilled students with basic training and minimal supervision. We needed to come up with a system that provided students access to industrial fabrication and machining equipment in a safe and productive environment. The peer support system provides a framework enabling students with little or no machine operating skills to safely access industrial equipment with minimal staff, supervision and danger of injury.

Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) are adopting different strategies in their teaching curricula and assessment methods to encourage the development of team management skills among graduates, one of which is peer assessment. It is an important component in the design of an effective learning environment in Higher Education (HE) and for promoting a strong participatory and collaborative culture among students. It provides students with a platform to not only engage with the HE learning process but also to learn from each other by receiving and giving critical feedback. Reflective writing in HE offers a flexible platform for students to discuss the contributions made by peers in teamwork however, not many researchers have looked at its potential as a peer assessment tool. This study addresses this gap by using the case study of the MSc Engineering Management (EM) programme at York (UK). Using the method of content analysis, this study looks at the quality of peer assessment and the skills gap analysis demonstrated in the reflective assignments students undertake in one of the modules. The findings show the viability and potential of this method for building peer assessment skills. It eliminates some of the limitations like bias among students usually encountered in other peer assessment tools. It also helps in skills gap analysis and for understanding group dynamics in teamwork. Students should therefore, be encouraged to seek the application of such tools for skills analysis, to build up confidence in peer assessment and boosting employability factors.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3968-9; POD:978-1-5386-3969-6; USB:978-1-5386-3967-2","10.1109/ITHET.2017.8067802","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8067802","Employability;Higher Education;Peer Assessment;Reflective Writing;Teamwork","Education;Research and development management;Teamwork;Tools;Writing","educational computing;educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;further education;teaching;team working","MSc Engineering Management programme;employability factors;higher education students;peer assessment tool;teaching curricula;team management skills;team members","","","","","","","","10-12 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To distinguish which ones are direct or significant causal (harmful) factors to the target systems, we often need to calculate a (local) causal network, but the existing methods usually return Markov equivalence classes instead of an actual causal structure. In this paper, a new approach for inferring causal direction from multi-dimensional causal networks for assessing harmful factors in security analysis is proposed based on a split-and-merge strategy. The method first decomposes an n-dimensional network into induced subnetworks, each of which corresponds to a node in the network. We show that each induced subnetwork can be subsumed into one of the three substructures: one-degree, non-triangle, and triangle-existence substructures. Three effective algorithms are developed to infer causalities from the three substructures. The whole causal structure of the multi-dimensional network is obtained by learning these induced subnetworks separately. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is more general and effective than the state-of-the-art methods.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2746539","10.13039/501100001809 - NSFC-Guangdong Joint Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100007162 - Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8023750","Bayesian causal model;causal direction learning;security analysis;split-and-merge","Additive noise;Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Bayes methods;Boolean functions;Data structures;Security","","","","","","","","OAPA","20170831","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The task of leveraging this data by employing moving objects database techniques to predict spatio-temporal locations in an accurate and efficient fashion, comprising a complete trajectory remains an actively researched area. Existing methods for frequent sequential pattern mining tend to be limited to predicting short-term partial trajectories, at extremely high computational costs. In order to address these limitations, we designed a prefix-projection-based trajectory prediction algorithm called PrefixTP, which contains three essential phases. First, data collection, connected vehicles equipped with sensors comprise a vehicle grid and generate copious amounts of spatio-temporal data, in order to communicate and share traffic information. Second, model training, examining only the prefix subsequences, and projecting only their corresponding postfix subsequences into projected sets. Finally, trajectory matching, recursively finding postfix sequences meeting the requirement of minimum support count, and outputting the most frequent sequential pattern as the most probable trajectory. Fundamentally, PrefixTP supports three trajectory matching strategies which encompass all possibilities of prediction. Extensive experiments were conducted using real world GPS data sets, and the results show, when comparing predicted complete trajectories against partial short-term trajectories with a guarantee of real-time forecasting, that PrefixTP outperforms first-order, second-order Markov models, and Apriori-based trajectory prediction algorithm.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2017.2750075","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Planning Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education of China; Youth Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8063439","Trajectory prediction;connected vehicles;frequent sequential pattern;moving objects databases;prefix-projection.","Databases;Hidden Markov models;Pattern matching;Predictive models;Roads;Trajectory;Uncertainty","","","","","","","","","20171009","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The explosive prevalence of Internet of Things, big data, and fog computing in the context of cloud computing makes it extremely challenging to explore both cloud and fog resource scheduling strategy so as to improve the efficiency of resources utilization, satisfy the users' QoS requirements, and maximize the profit of both resource providers and users. This paper proposes a resource allocation strategy for fog computing based on priced timed Petri nets (PTPNs), by which the user can choose the satisfying resources autonomously from a group of preallocated resources. Our strategy comprehensively considers the price cost and time cost to complete a task, as well as the credibility evaluation of both users and fog resources. We construct the PTPN models of tasks in fog computing in accordance with the features of fog resources. Algorithm that predicts task completion time is presented. Method of computing the credibility evaluation of fog resource is also proposed. In particular, we give the dynamic allocation algorithm of fog resources. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can achieve a higher efficiency than static allocation strategies in terms of task completion time and price.","","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2709814","Project of Shandong Province Higher Educational Science and Technology Program; Qingdao Post-Doctoral Researchers Applied Research Projects Fund (Cloud Computing in Mine Geology Data Storage and Analysis Application); 10.13039/501100001809 - NSF of China; 10.13039/501100004204 - Open Project of Tongji University Embedded System and Service Computing of Ministry of Education of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7935527","Fog computing;modeling and simulation;priced timed Petri nets (PTPNs);resource allocation;resource scheduling","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Edge computing;Heuristic algorithms;Internet of Things;Petri nets;Resource management","Petri nets;cloud computing;quality of service;resource allocation;scheduling","PTPN models;cloud computing;fog computing;fog resource scheduling strategy;fog resources dynamic allocation algorithm;priced timed Petri nets;quality of service;resource allocation strategy;resources utilization","","","","","","Traditional","20170530","Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Virtualization is an economic way of solving this problem. The data-collected by different vendors' sensors-share the same computing program encapsulated by the virtual machine (VM), so that the physical-layer difference can be hidden. To eliminate the extra cost and long delay of transferring VMs to the remote cloud, the edge device (ED) processes local VMs' requirements in prior. Hence, the sustainable strategy for recycling EDs is an important way to safeguard the network sustainability. To improve the recycling efficiency, most of the EDs should be upgraded simultaneously during one batch by migrating their local VMs to others for the service continuity. We investigate the least upgrade batch for recycling EDs in IoT networks. A two-step algorithm called minimized upgrade batch VM scheduling and bandwidth planning (MSBP) is designed to minimize the number of upgrade batches. As the frequent VM migration brings the bandwidth consumption and contention of trajectories, in our MSBP, two strategies: 1) shortest trajectory first and 2) least bandwidth utilization first (LBUF), are also considered. The simulation results show that: 1) MSBP has the optimal recycling efficiency (least number of upgrade batches) for EDs and 2) LBUF more effectively mitigates the negative impact of the path contention level on the recycling efficiency.","","","10.1109/JIOT.2017.2727098","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; 10.13039/100010002 - General Armament Department and Ministry of Education United Fund; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7981334","Edge devices recycling;Internet of Things (IoT) network sustainability","Bandwidth;Batteries;Internet of Things;Optical fiber communication;Optical sensors;Recycling;Trajectory","Internet of Things;cloud computing;recycling;scheduling;virtual machines;virtualisation","ED;Internet of Things devices;IoT networks;MSBP;bandwidth consumption;bandwidth planning;data interoperability;edge device;frequent VM migration;local VM requirements;minimized upgrade batch VM;network sustainability;operation principles;optimal recycling efficiency;remote cloud;scheduling;sustainable Internet of Things networks;sustainable strategy;virtual machine;virtualization","","","","","","Traditional","20170714","Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It is of interest to find optimal assignments of tasks to local and remote devices that can take into account the application-specific profile, availability of computational resources, and link connectivity, and find a balance between energy consumption costs of mobile devices and latency for delay-sensitive applications. We formulate an NP-hard problem to minimize the application latency while meeting prescribed resource utilization constraints. Different from most of existing works that either rely on the integer programming solver, or on heuristics that offer no theoretical performance guarantees, we propose Hermes, a novel fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS). We identify for a subset of problem instances, where the application task graphs can be described as serial trees, Hermes provides a solution with latency no more than (1 + ε) times of the minimum while incurring complexity that is polynomial in problem size and 1/ε. We further propose an online algorithm to learn the unknown dynamic environment and guarantee that the performance gap compared to the optimal strategy is bounded by a logarithmic function with time. Evaluation is done by using real data set collected from several benchmarks, and is shown that Hermes improves the latency by 16 percent compared to a previously published heuristic and increases CPU computing time by only 0.4 percent of overall latency.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2017.2679712","10.13039/100002463 - General Motors Corporation; 10.13039/100009533 - Armenian National Science and Education Fund; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7874147","Mobile cloud computing;approximation algorithms;computational offloading;on-line learning","Cloud computing;Complexity theory;Electronic mail;Mobile computing;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation;Servers","cloud computing;computational complexity;file servers;graph theory;integer programming;linear programming;mobile computing;mobile handsets","CPU computing time;FPTAS;Hermes;NP-hard problem;application task graphs;cloud servers;computational resources;computational tasks offloading;delay-sensitive applications;energy consumption costs;fully polynomial time approximation scheme;integer programming solver;latency optimal task assignment;link connectivity;local resource usage;mobile devices;remote devices;resource utilization constraints;resource-constrained mobile computing;theoretical performance guarantees;unknown dynamic environment","","","","","","Traditional","20170308","Nov. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Specifically, we present a system architecture to enable the road-side unit assisted data scheduling via vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. Then, we give a theoretical analysis on the opportunity of successful data sharing among vehicles driving in opposite directions based on the analysis of signal-to-interference-noise-ratio of V2V communication.

In this model, based on the individual utility, the strategy state will be asynchronously updated according to the Fermi-like rule. Among them, each individual will be initially endowed with an integral reputation value, and then it evolves during the evolution of strategy; while for the individual utility, it is characterized as the product of the game payoff and a power function of reputation value. Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method is adopted here to verify the system's evolutionary characteristics, and large quantities of simulations demonstrate that the cooperation behavior can be greatly varied and enhanced when the reputation is incorporated into the utility evaluation. Detailed strategy distribution proves that the individual with large reputation value renders the cooperators to lower their risks to be reaped by defectors, and dominates the evolution of cooperation within the whole population. In addition, the whole cooperation phase diagrams show that the coexistence region of cooperators and defectors becomes narrower and narrower as the reputation is introduced more and more. Meanwhile, it is also displayed that the reputation effect favors the evolution of cooperation, and greatly fosters the cooperators to form the compact clusters so as to reduce the risk of being invaded by defectors. To summarize, current results are conducive to making a deeper insight into the evolution of collective cooperation within many real-world biological and man-made systems.","1932-8184;19328184","","10.1109/JSYST.2016.2539364","Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars (Ministry of Education); 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC); 10.13039/501100002858 - China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7448876","Cooperation risk analysis;promotion of cooperation;public goods game (PGG);reputation effect;spatial reciprocity","Analytical models;Evolution (biology);Games;Lattices;Risk analysis;Sociology","Monte Carlo methods;economics;evolutionary computation;game theory;risk analysis;utility theory","Fermi-like rule;MCS;Monte Carlo simulation;PGG;cooperation yielded;evolutionary game;individual utility;risk analysis;risk enhancement;spatial public goods game;utility evaluation","","","","","","Traditional","20160407","Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

There are two main drawbacks when the Group Lasso penalty has been directly employed during network training. They are numerical oscillations and theoretical challenges in computing the gradients at the origin. To overcome these obstacles, smoothing functions have then been introduced by approximating the Group Lasso penalty. Numerical experiments for classification and regression problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithms perform better than the other three classical penalization methods, Weight Decay, Weight Elimination, and Approximate Smoother, on both generalization and pruning efficiency. In addition, detailed simulations based on a specific data set have been performed to compare with some other common pruning strategies, which verify the advantages of the proposed algorithm.

To improve the reception reliability of destinations with poor channel conditions, we first divide destinations in the network into two types: Type I and Type II. Type I destinations refer to the destinations with capability of successful information decoding and energy harvesting, which serve as relays to help other destinations. Type II destinations have poor connections to the source and hence compete to obtain help from Type I destinations. Accordingly, cooperative relaying strategies for the two types of destinations are proposed on the basis of coalition formation game. First, we propose to utilize the dynamic programming (DP) approach to obtain the optimal coalition structure in the network, though at the cost of heavy time and storage complexity. Then, two distributed hedonic coalition formation (DHCF) approaches are developed to generate coalition structures, which are more efficient than the DP approach. Simulation results show that all proposed approaches outperform the non-cooperative one (i.e., direct link transmission). The results also illustrate that the DP approach achieves the largest data rate and lowest outage probability for destinations, and the DHCF approaches achieve near-to-optimal performance.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2749515","Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation; H2020-MSCA-RISE-2015; 10.13039/501100000266 - U.K. EPSRC; 10.13039/501100001809 - NSFC; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8030997","Cooperative networks;coalition formation game;energy harvesting","Complexity theory;Cooperative systems;Game theory;Games;Receivers;Relays;Wireless communication","cooperative communication;decoding;dynamic programming;energy harvesting;game theory;probability;radiofrequency power transmission;relay networks (telecommunication);telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication power management","DHCF approaches;DP approach;SWIPT;Type I destinations;Type II destinations;coalition formation game;cooperative networks;cooperative relaying strategies;data rate;distributed hedonic coalition formation approaches;dynamic programming approach;energy harvesting;game-theoretic approaches;information decoding;optimal coalition structure;outage probability;reception reliability;simultaneous wireless information-and-power transfer","","","","","","OAPA","20170911","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, with the proliferation of MIMO technologies, traditional single-core-based solutions are hardly able to fulfill requirements with acceptable power and area cost. The reliance on multi-/many-core system is increasing. Different from the computation-limited single-core-based solutions, multi/many-core systems are often communication-limited. In this paper, aiming at MIMO interference cancellation algorithms, we propose a flexible master-slave-based multiprocessor system-on-chiparchitecture based on a systematically divide-and-conquer approach to optimize the communication problems from the application-, architecture- and programming-levels. First, a comprehensively analysis of several typical applications in terms of parallelism, communication patterns and computation patterns is presented. According to the analysis results, a low-complexity and flexible ad hoc point-to-point interconnected fine-grained programmable-element (f -PE) is proposed to execute the arithmetic calculation. In order to reduce the communication traffic, an f-PE-based slave-node is constructed to exploit the data and instruction localities of applications, and a master node that is used to schedule and serve data for the slave nodes is also integrated.

In this paper, in order to answer the open problem whether this functioning of producing more spikes and replicating spikes can be avoided by using some strategy without the loss of computation power, we introduce cSN P systems with request rules, which have classical spiking rules and forgetting rules, and also request rules in the skin membrane. The skin membrane can receive spikes from the environment by the application of request rules. cSN P systems with request rules are proved to be Turing universal. The results show that the decrease of computation power caused by removing the internal functioning of producing more spikes and replicating spikes can be compensated by request rules, which suggests that the communication between a cell and the environment is an essential ingredient of systems in terms of computation power.","1536-1241;15361241","","10.1109/TNB.2017.2722466","Innovation Scientists and Technicians Troop Construction Projects of Henan Province; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7967629","Bio-inspired computing;computation power;membrane computing;spiking neural P system;universality","Biological neural networks;Biomembranes;Computational modeling;Nanobioscience;Neurons;Registers;Skin","bioelectric phenomena;biomembranes;neurophysiology;skin","cSN P systems;cell-like spiking neural P systems;classical spiking rules;compartmentalized structures;computation power;distributed computation models;forgetting rules;living cells;parallel computation models;skin membrane","","","","","","Traditional","20170703","Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To authenticate the scalable video coding (SVC) streams by fully utilizing its decoding relationship without reducing its scalability, we establish an acyclic and directed decoding dependence graph (DDG) on the logical units of SVC steams. By applying the topological sort on DDG, we obtain the hash appendence mode for different layers of the streams (i.e., spatial and temporal layers). We propose a secure and efficient SVC authentication method based on the deduced hash appendence mode. With regard to the quality layer, we consider the corresponding quality data packets with unequal importance, and propose a grouping authentication strategy with constrained group lengths. We form the optimization problem of minimizing the authentication cost, and solve it by an iteration method.

We built a prototype consisting of a two-dimensional tangential force sensor and a surface transducer to test the effectiveness of the model. Participants in user experiments with the prototype perceived the rigid surface of the prototype as a moving, rubber-like plate. The main findings of the experiments are: 1) the perceived stiffness of a simulated material can be controlled by controlling the force-playback transfer function, 2) its perceptual properties such as softness and pleasantness can be controlled by changing friction grain parameters, and 3) the use of the vibrotactile compliance feedback reduces participants' workload including physical demand and frustration while performing a force repetition task.","1939-1412;19391412","","10.1109/TOH.2016.2604305","Basic Science Research Program; Ministry of Education; 10.13039/100007431 - National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7556272","Haptic I/O;input devices and strategies;tactile displays","Force;Force measurement;Friction;Haptic interfaces;Prototypes;Springs;Vibrations","actuators;force sensors;haptic interfaces;transducers;vibrations","force-playback transfer function;friction grain parameters;friction-induced vibrations;haptic illusion;perceptual properties;rigid surface;surface transducer;tangential force interaction;two-dimensional tangential force sensor;vibration patterns;vibrotactile actuator;vibrotactile compliance feedback","","","","","","Traditional","20160830","July-Sept. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, SNs also bring in new threats to smart grid: misinformation in SNs may cause smart grid users to alter their demand, resulting in transmission line overloading and in turn leading to catastrophic impact to the grid. In this paper, we discuss the interdependence in the SN coupled smart grid and focus on its vulnerability. That is, how much can the smart grid be damaged when misinformation related to it diffuses in SNs? To analytically study the problem, we propose the misinformation attack problem in social-smart grid that identifies the top critical nodes in the SN, such that the smart grid can be greatly damaged when misinformation propagates from those nodes. This problem is challenging as we have to incorporate the complexity of the two networks concurrently. Nevertheless, we propose a technique that can explicitly take into account information diffusion in SN, power flow balance, and cascading failure in smart grid integratedly when evaluating node criticality, based on which we propose various strategies in selecting the most critical nodes. Also, we introduce controlled load shedding as a protection strategy to reduce the impact of cascading failure. The effectiveness of our algorithms is demonstrated by experiments on the IEEE bus test cases as well as the Pegase data set.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2738565","10.13039/100000001 - NSF EFRI; 10.13039/501100002560 - Soonchunhyang University Research Fund; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8017402","Social network;cascading failure;interdependent networks;power grid;smart grid","Companies;Integrated circuit modeling;Load modeling;Power transmission lines;Smart grids;Social network services","load flow;load shedding;power engineering computing;smart power grids;social networking (online)","IEEE bus test case;Pegase data set;SN coupled smart grid;controlled load shedding;energy usage reduction;load curve smoothing;misinformation attack problem;power flow balance;protection strategy;social network;social-smart grid;transmission line overloading;utility companies;vulnerability analysis","","","","","","OAPA","20170829","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A controller called Ahura (a heuristic-based racer) for the open racing car simulator is proposed in this paper. Ahura includes five modules, namely steer controller, speed controller, opponent manager, dynamic adjuster, and stuck handler. These modules have 23 parameters all together that are tuned using an evolutionary strategy for a particular car to ensure fast and safe drive on different tracks. These tuned parameters are further modified by the dynamic adjuster module during the run according to the width, friction, and dangerous zones of the track. The dynamic adjustment enables Ahura to decide on-the-fly based on the current situation; hence, it eliminates the need for prior knowledge about the characteristics of the track. The driving performance of Ahura is compared with other state-of-the-art controllers on 40 tracks when they drive identical cars. Our experiments indicate that Ahura performs significantly better than other controllers in terms of damage and completion time especially on complex tracks (road tracks). Also, experiments show that the overtaking strategy of Ahura is safer and more effective compared to other controllers.","1943-068X;1943068X","","10.1109/TCIAIG.2016.2565661","ARC Discovery; Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education (MNiSW); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7467534","Automatic car racing;car racing simulator;evolutionary strategy;neural networks","Acceleration;Australia;Automobiles;Gears;Sensors;Wheels","automobiles;computer games;control engineering computing;evolutionary computation;road traffic control;traffic engineering computing","Ahura;artificial intelligence;automatic drivers;car racing;dynamic adjuster module;evolutionary strategy;heuristic-based racer;open racing car simulator;opponent manager module;overtaking strategy;robotics;speed controller;speed controller module;steer controller module;stuck handler module","","","","","","Traditional","20160510","Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It turns out that minimizing a specified cost may result in remarkable increases of other costs. Then, we propose a short-term prediction based mechanism (SPM) for the cloud provider to periodically deduce the request distribution strategies. With real-world data traces, we show that SPM can always obtain a suitable trade-off among different costs.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1629-1; POD:978-1-5386-1630-7; USB:978-1-5386-1628-4","10.1109/ISCC.2017.8024629","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8024629","","Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Delays;Power demand;Pricing;Renewable energy sources;Servers","cloud computing;computer centres;energy consumption;geographic information systems;optimisation;resource allocation","GLB;SPM;cloud providers;cost efficient cloud data centers;electricity price;energy consumption;geographical load balancing;green energy generation;optimization-based framework;short-term prediction based mechanism;transmission delay","","","","","","","","3-6 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In smart building systems, services, stored as rules, are achieved by rule analyzing and executing. However, the irrational contents of rules and the conflicts among rules may bring confusion and maloperation in the system. To verify the correctness of rules, we propose a lightweight rule verification and resolution framework which mainly include: 1) a rule verification system for content anomaly detection and rule conflict detection by using domain knowledge and probability analysis and 2) a quick resolution strategy for rule conflicts based on conflict-scenario-analysis. This framework can balance the verification quality with speed and guarantee that the rule system performs appropriately. Moreover, in order to reduce the comparison in rule verification, we apply a tree structure to store the building structure hierarchically and bind every rule to one node in the location tree. This way, the position information of a rule can be extracted, and the verification efficiency can be improved. The experimental results show that our proposed framework and strategies can perform efficiently and flexibly in a smart building system.","","","10.1109/TETC.2016.2531288","Research Fund for Doctoral Program of Higher Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7410028","Wireless sensor-actuator networks;anomaly detection;knowledge-based;rule conflict;rule verification;smart building","Feature extraction;Petri nets;Smart buildings;Temperature sensors;Windows;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;building management systems","Internet of Things;content anomaly detection;domain knowledge;probability analysis;rule conflict detection;rule verification system;smart buildings;wireless sensor-actuator networks","","","","","","","20160218","July-Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Knowledge of guidelines is used as decision aids in clinical situations, and during this process, no patient health conditions are considered. In this paper, we propose an SDM system framework for type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients that not only contains knowledge abstracted from guidelines but also employs a multilabel classification model that uses class-imbalanced electronic health record (EHR) data and that aims to provide a recommended list of available antihyperglycemic medications to help physicians and patients have an SDM conversation. The use of EHR data to serve as a decision-support component in decision aids helps physicians and patients to reach a more intuitive understanding of current health conditions and allows the tailoring of the available knowledge to each patient, leading to a more effective SDM. Real-world data from 2542 T2DM inpatient EHRs were substituted by 77 features and eight output labels, i.e., eight antihyperglycemic medications, and these data were utilized to build and validate the recommendation model. The multilabel recommendation model exhibited stable performance in every single-label classification and showed the ability to predict minority positive cases in which the average recall value of the eight classes was 0.9898.

The placement prediction is more complex when the complexity of educational entities increase. Educational institutes look for more efficient technology that assist better management and support decision making procedures or assist them to set new strategies. One of the effective ways to address the challenges for improving the quality is to provide new knowledge related to the educational processes and entities to the managerial system. With the machine learning techniques the knowledge can be extracted from operational and historical data that resides within the educational organization's databases using. The dataset for system implementation contains information about past data of students. These data are used for training the model for rule identification and for testing the model for classification. This paper presents a recommendation system that predicts the students to have one of the five placement statuses, viz., Dream Company, Core Company, Mass Recruiters, Not Eligible and Not Interested in Placements. This model helps the placement cell within an organization to identify the prospective students and pay attention to and improve their technical as well as interpersonal skills. Furthermore, the students in pre-final and final years of their B. Tech course can also use this system to know their individual placement status that they are most likely to achieve.

Specific researches on the relationship among demographic characteristics and the mobile banking functions and marketing strategies are quite few. This article aims to offer a comprehensive analysis of the influence of demographic characteristic factors on the use of mobile banking functions via the use of questionnaires and big data analytics. Several cross analyses and decision trees are used in the process in order to provide banks with implications to find potential target clients groups according to the demographic characteristics, which can help them to improve certain products and services.

However, most existing work on CDG mainly focuses on multihop relaying strategies to improve the performance of data gathering. In this paper, we propose a mobile CDG scheme including a random walk-based algorithm and a kernel-based method for sparsifying sensory data from irregular deployments. The proposed scheme allows a mobile collector to harvest data by sequentially visiting a number of nodes along a random path. More importantly, toward building the gap between CS and machine learning theories, we explore a theoretical foundation for understanding the feasibility of the proposed scheme. We prove that the CS matrices, constructed from the proposed random walk algorithm combined with a kernel-based sparsity basis, satisfy the restricted isometry property. Particularly, we also show that m=O(klog (n/k)) measurements collected by a mobile collector are sufficient to recover a k-sparse signal and t=O(klog (n/k)) steps are required to collect these measurements in a network with n nodes. Finally, we also present extensive numerical results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme by evaluating the performance in terms of energy consumption and the impact of packet losses. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is able to not only significantly reduce communication cost but also combat unreliable wireless links under various packet losses compared to the state-of-the-art schemes, which provides an efficient alternative to data relaying approaches for CDG in WSNS.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMC.2017.2734886","China Scholarship Council; Cross-Strait Joint Fund of National Natural Science Foundation of China; Fujian Collaborative Innovation Center for Big Data Application in Governments the Technology Innovation Platform Project of Fujian Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8013710","Compressive sensing (CS);Gaussian kernel;machine learning theory;mobile data gathering;random walk;wireless sensor network systems (WSNSs)","Loss measurement;Machine learning algorithms;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Routing;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","","20170821","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, we conduct a survey and build the taxonomy on current existing energy efficiency relevant surveys, that is, a survey on surveys of energy efficiency. We classify current existing surveys into five categories, including surveys on the energy efficiency of the whole cloud related systems, surveys on energy efficiency of the certain level or component of the cloud, surveys on all of energy efficient strategies, surveys on a certain energy efficiency techniques, and other energy efficiency related surveys. The survey and taxonomy on the energy efficient relevant surveys conducted in this paper provide comprehensive knowledge on the current level of this research filed. Furthermore, observations are exhibited by the statistic data graphs exacted from the investigated surveys. The observations hidden in those surveys on energy efficiency will make it clear the future research directions in the energy related research field.

Apache Hadoop is an open-source ecosystem that manages large data sets in a distributed environment. MapReduce is a programming model that processes massive amount of unstructured data sets over Hadoop cluster. Recently, Hadoop enhances its homogeneous storage function to heterogeneous storage and stores data sets into multiple storage media, i.e., SSD, RAM, and DISK. This development increases the performance of data block placement strategy and allows a client to store large data sets into multiple storage media efficiently than homogeneous storage. However, this evolution increases the consumption of computing capacity and memory usage over MapReduce job scheduling. The scheduler processes MapReduce job into homogeneous container having configuration of CPU, memory, DISK volume, and network I/O, and accesses, processes, and stores data sets over heterogeneous storage media. This produces a processing latency of locating and pairing source data set to MapReduce tasks and results an abnormal high consumption of computing capacity and memory usage in a Datanode. Similarly, when scheduler assigns MapReduce jobs to multiple Datanodes, the same processing latency can severely affect the performance of whole cluster. In this paper, we present Storage-Tag-Aware Scheduler (STAS) that reduces processing latency by scheduling MapReduce jobs into heterogeneous storage containers, i.e., SSD, DISK, and RAM container. STAS endorses job with a tag of storage media, such as JobSSD, JobDISK, and JobRAM and parses them into heterogeneous shared-queues, which assign processing configuration to enlist jobs. STAS manager then schedules shared-queue jobs into heterogeneous MapReduce containers and generates an output into storage media of the cluster. The experimental evaluation shows that STAS optimizes the consumption of computing capacity - nd memory usage efficiently than available schedulers in a Hadoop cluster.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2725318","10.13039/501100003725 - Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea through the Ministry of Education; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7976300","HDFS;Hadoop;MapReduce;scheduler;storage-tier","Containers;Ecosystems;Media;Memory management;Programming;Random access memory;Schedules","Big Data;data analysis;parallel processing;public domain software;scheduling;storage management","Apache Hadoop;Big Data analytics;CPU;DISK volume;Datanode;Hadoop cluster;MapReduce job scheduling;STAS;data block placement strategy;data set storage;distributed environment;heterogeneous MapReduce containers;heterogeneous shared-queues;heterogeneous storage media;memory;multiple storage media;network I/O;open-source ecosystem;processing configuration;programming model;shared-queue jobs;storage-tag-aware scheduler;unstructured data set processesing","","","","","","OAPA","20170712","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

First, we pointed out that photo response nonuniformity (PRNU) separated by a color filter array forms a pattern independent of others, since the position of each PRNU pixel means that they do not overlap. Using PRNUs from each color channel of an image, we designed a forensic scheme for estimating hue modification. We also proposed an efficient estimation scheme and an algorithm for detecting partial manipulation. The results confirmed that the proposed method distinguishes hue modification and estimates the degree of change; moreover, it is resistant to the effects of common image processing.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2016.2539828","Korea Copyright Commission; 10.13039/501100003561 - Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism; 10.13039/501100003725 - Global Ph.D. Fellowship Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea within the Ministry of Education; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7429729","Color filter array (CFA);digital image forensics;hue;photo response nonuniformity (PRNU);sensor pattern noise","Algorithm design and analysis;Correlation;Digital images;Estimation;Forensics;Forgery;Image color analysis","image colour analysis","PRNU pixel;color filter array;common image processing;digital image;hue modification detection;image forgery;partial manipulation detection;photoresponse nonuniformity;robust forensics scheme","","1","","","","","20160309","Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, in the fuzzy setting, game graphs are yet to be addressed, although some practical applications, such as modeling fuzzy systems that interact with their environments, appeal to such models. To fill the gap, in this paper, we propose a fuzzy version of game graphs and focus on the fuzzy game graphs with reachability objectives, which we will refer to as fuzzy reachability games (FRGs). In an FRG, the goal of one player is to maximize her truth value of reaching a given target set, while the other player aims at the opposite. In this framework, we show that FRGs are determined in the sense that for every state, both of the two players have the same value, and there exist optimal memoryless strategies for both players. Moreover, we design algorithms, which achieve polynomial time complexity in the size of the FRG, to compute the values of all states and the optimal memoryless strategies for the players. For a special class of FRGs, we provide an improved algorithm that achieves linear-logarithmic running time to compute the values of states. In addition, several examples are given to illustrate our motivation and the theoretical development.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2016.2593495","Higher School Doctoral Subject Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002858 - China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7517395","Fuzzy automaton;fuzzy logic;fuzzy transition system (FTS);game graph;reachability","Automata;Computational modeling;Computer science;Fuzzy systems;Games;Stochastic processes;Uncertainty","computational complexity;fuzzy set theory;game theory;probability;reachability analysis","FRGs;computer science;formal verification;fuzzy game graphs;fuzzy reachability games;linear-logarithmic running time;optimal memoryless strategies;polynomial time complexity;probabilistic versions;reactive systems;two-player turn-based games","","","","","","","20160720","Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This combination provides an accelerated implementation on graphics processing unit (GPU), and the proposed method is, therefore, referred to as G-DPSORE. In G-DPSO-RE, a dynamic labor division strategy is incorporated into the swarms according to the designed evolutionary factor during the evolution process. Two novel modifications of the movement equation are designed to update the velocity of particles. Moreover, a chaotic-logistic-based immune RE operator is developed to facilitate the global best individual (gBest particle) to explore a potentially better region. Furthermore, a GPU parallel acceleration technique is utilized to speed up parameter estimation procedure. It has been demonstrated that the proposed method is effective for simultaneous estimation of the PMSM parameters and the disturbance voltage (V<sub>dead</sub>) due to VSI nonlinearity from experimental data for currents and rotor speed measured with inexpensive equipment.

Therefore, the analysis of crowd aggregation behavior has been a new research focus in the field of intelligent video surveillance. However, such public area scenes not only contain moving crowd but also contain other types of objects. The sizes of these objects are usually small, which make their appearances quite similar. Moreover, the individuals in a crowd move randomly and often occlude each other. All the above factors make the analysis of crowd aggregation very difficult. In this paper, the authors attempt to solve this problem in three aspects. Firstly, a novel global feature is used to represent the moving crowd. This feature can well describe the spatial and the temporal motion information of points-of-interest. Then, a strategy is adopted to cluster the feature points firstly and then calculate the collectiveness. This makes the collectiveness computation of individual groups more consistent and effective. Finally, more comprehensive collective crowd descriptors are proposed to provide a detailed description of the crowd status. Based on the proposed descriptor, the authors realize the evolution analysis of the group movement and the crowd abnormal detection. The experiment results show that the proposed method is able to efficiently compute the crowd collectiveness in various public areas and provide a reliable reference for the public safety management.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2017.2731866","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7990566","abnormal detection;collectiveness computation;crowd movement;global feature extraction;movement evolution","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Dynamics;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Tracking;Trajectory","","","","","","","","","20170725","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Moreover, this controller is structurally simple and computationally inexpensive. From Lyapunov-stability analysis, it is shown that all signals of the controlled closed-loop system are uniformly ultimately bounded.

Nowadays, graph-based methods are widely applied to saliency detection including manifold ranking(MR) method, which is shown to be fast and effective. However, because of only using a single feature and imperfect selection strategy for background seeds, MR has a poor performance in some circumstances. In order to complete more challenging saliency detection, an improved method based on manifold ranking algorithm is proposed in this paper. The adopted parallel architecture enables the final detection results generated with the combination of calculations from background seeds and foreground seeds. These seeds are quickly obtained by using priori information and the graph structure is optimized with adding three constraints. Moreover, the graph edge weights are computed by utilizing a adaptive local width parameter and measuring multi-features distance. Three-stage strategy is used to calculate the final saliency map. Experiment results on two large famous datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs better comparing with MR and other state-of-the-art methods.","","CD:978-1-5090-4656-0; Electronic:978-1-5090-4657-7; POD:978-1-5090-4658-4","10.1109/CCDC.2017.7979048","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7979048","Background seeds;Foreground seeds;Graph edge weights;Graph structure;Manifold ranking;Parallel architecture;Saliency detection;Three-stage strategy","Aerospace electronics;Histograms;Image color analysis;Image edge detection;Kernel;Manifolds;Parallel architectures","computer vision;graph theory","background seeds;computer vision;foreground seeds;graph structure;graph-based methods;improved saliency detection;manifold ranking algorithm;parallel architecture;priori information;three-stage strategy","","","","","","","","28-30 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By constructing a cost function, an optimal route for a mobile agent between the sink and the cluster is obtained. An improved ant colony algorithm (ACA) is presented to form the route for the mobile agent in a cluster. Moreover, a simple scheme that turns off redundant nodes according to the measurement requirement is designed to improve the energy efficacy.

To deal with their emerging challenge of physical layer security, in this paper, we study the antieavesdropping problem in the presence of selfish jammers, who desire to achieve maximum profit for themselves. We consider both the single-channel multijammer (SCMJ) model and the multichannel single-jammer (MCSJ) model. We investigate the interaction between the source that transmits secret information and friendly jammer nodes who assist the source by interfering with the eavesdropper. This problem is formulated as an oligopoly market consisting of a few firms and a buyer. By modeling the problem as a Bertrand game based on price competition, we obtain the optimal pricing scheme for the friendly, while for selfish jammers, the utility of those jammers is maximized. For the SCMJ model, we prove the existence of Bertrand Equilibrium by deriving a closed-form expression for the optimal price strategy. For the MCSJ model, a closed-form expression for power allocation is derived, based on which a new algorithm is designed to obtain the optimal strategy of the jammer. Finally, via simulations, we verify our theoretical analysis.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2016.2639827","National Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Open Research Fund of the Key Laboratory of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology (NUPT); Qinlan Project of Jiangsu Province; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; 10.13039/501100005374 - NUPT; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7782794","Bertrand game;eavesdropping;game theory;jamming;security;wireless networks","Game theory;Games;Jamming;Physical layer;Security;Wireless networks","game theory;jamming;pricing;radio networks","Bertrand equilibrium;Bertrand game approach;MCSJ model;SCMJ model;antieavesdropping;closed-form expression;multichannel single-jammer;oligopoly market;optimal price strategy;optimal pricing scheme;physical layer security;power allocation;price competition;selfish jammers;selfish jamming;single-channel multijammer;wireless communications;wireless networks","","","","","","","20161214","July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to the inherent conflicts, however, simultaneously achieving optimum on all these properties is impractical. N-way Replication and Erasure Coding, two extensively-applied storage schemes with high reliability, adopt opposite and unbalanced strategies on the tradeoff among these properties, thus considerably restraining their effectiveness on wide range of workloads. To address the aforementioned obstacle, we propose a novel storage scheme called ASSER, an ASSembling chain of Erasure coding and Replication. ASSER stores each object in two parts: a full copy and a certain amount of erasure-coded segments. We establish dedicated read/write protocols for ASSER leveraging the unique structural advantages. On the basis of elementary protocols, we implement sequential and PRAM (Pipeline-RAM) consistency to make ASSER feasible for various services with different performance/consistency requirements. Evaluation results demonstrate that under the same fault tolerance and consistency level, ASSER outperforms N-way replication and pure erasure coding in I/O throughput under diverse system and workload configurations with superior performance stability. More importantly, ASSER delivers stably efficient I/O performance at much lower storage cost than the other comparatives.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2017.2671871","Ministry of Education of China; National Science and Technology Supporting Program of China; New-Century Excellent Talents Program; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100000923 - Australian Research Council; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7859394","ASSER;cost-effective;efficient;object-based storage;reliable","Cloud computing;Encoding;Fault tolerance;Multiprotocol label switching;Phase change random access memory;Servers","cloud computing;concurrency theory;input-output programs;storage management","ASSER;I/O performance;N-way replication;PRAM;assembling chain of erasure coding and replication;cost-effective storage scheme;object-based cloud storage systems;pipeline-RAM;reliable storage scheme","","","","","","","20170220","Aug. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, the direct yaw-moment control strategies are proposed for in-wheel electric vehicles by using sliding mode (SM) and nonlinear disturbance observer (NDOB) techniques. The ideal sideslip angle at the center of gravity and the yaw rate are first calculated based on a linear two degree of freedom vehicle model. Then, the actual sideslip angle is identified and estimated by constructing a state observer. On this basis, a traditional discontinuous SM direct yaw-moment controller is designed to guarantee that the sideslip angle and the yaw rate will approach the ideal ones as closely as possible. To tackle the chattering problem existing in the traditional SM controller, a second-order sliding mode (SOSM) controller is further designed by taking the derivative of the controller as the new control, which implies that the actual control can be an integration of the SOSM controller. Finally, to avoid the large gains in the derived controllers, by combining the NDOB with the derived controllers, the composite control schemes are also proposed. In comparison with the discontinuous first-order SM controller, the proposed SOSM controller is shown to be more effective.","0278-0046;02780046","","10.1109/TIE.2017.2682024","Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Zhejiang Open Foundation of the Most Important Subjects; 10.13039/501100000923 - Australian Research Council; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002858 - China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7878609","Direct yaw-moment control (DYC);disturbance observer;finite-time control;sliding mode (SM)","Electric vehicles;Gravity;Mathematical model;Observers;Torque;Vehicle dynamics;Wheels","electric vehicles;machine control;variable structure systems","degree of freedom vehicle model;in-wheel electric vehicles;nonlinear disturbance observer;second-order sliding mode controller;sliding mode direct yaw-moment control design;vehicle stability","","","","","","","20170314","Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Handling scheduling uncertainties through traffic shaping in Time-Triggered train networks","Qinghan Yu; Xibin Zhao; Hai Wan; Yue Gao; Chenyang Lu; Ming Gu","Key Laboratory for Information System Security, Ministry of Education, China","2017 IEEE/ACM 25th International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS)","20170707","2017","","","1","6","While trains traditionally relied on field bus to support real-time control applications, next-generation trains are moving toward Ethernet as an integrated, high-bandwidth communication infrastructure for real-time control and best-effort consumer traffic. Time-Triggered Ethernet (TT-Ethernet) is a promising technology for train networks because of its capability to achieve deterministic latencies for real-time applications based on pre-computed transmission schedules. However, the deterministic scheduling approach of TT-Ethernet faces significant challenges in handling scheduling uncertainties caused by switch failures and legacy end devices in train networks. Due to the physical constraints on trains, train networks deal with switch failures by bypassing failed switches using a short circuiting mechanism. Unfortunately, this mechanism incurs scheduling errors as frames bypassing the failed switch may arrive ahead of the pre-computed schedule, resulting in early, unexpected, and out of order arrivals. Furthermore, as trains evolve from traditional communication technologies to TT-Ethernet, the network must support legacy end devices that may generate frames at times unknown to the TT-Ethernet. We propose a novel traffic shaping approach to deal with scheduling uncertainties in TT-Ethernet. The traffic shaper of a TT-Ethernet switch buffers early frames and then releases them at their pre-scheduled arrive time. Furthermore, we devise an efficient buffer management method for the traffic shaper in face of fault scenarios. Finally, we use the traffic shaper to integrate legacy devices into TT-Ethernet. We have implemented the traffic shaping approach in a 24-port TT-Ethernet switch specifically designed for train networks. Experiments show the traffic shaping strategy can effectively deal with scheduling uncertainties incurred by switch failures and legacy devices.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2704-4; POD:978-1-5386-2705-1","10.1109/IWQoS.2017.7969171","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7969171","","Out of order;Ports (Computers);Real-time systems;Redundancy;Schedules;Switches;Uncertainty","buffer storage;computer network reliability;next generation networks;railway communication;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","24- port TT-Ethernet switch buffers;best-effort consumer traffic;buffer management method;deter- ministic scheduling approach;deterministic latency;fault scenarios;integrated high-bandwidth communication infrastructure;next-generation trains;precomputed transmission scheduling;real-time applications;real-time control;real-time control application;scheduling uncertainty handling;short circuiting mechanism;switch failures;time-triggered Ethernet;time-triggered train networks;traffic shaping;traffic shaping approach","","","","","","","","14-16 June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Markl","TU Berlin, Berlin, Germany","IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","20170706","2017","29","8","1709","1722","Large-scale graph and machine learning analytics widely employ distributed iterative processing. Typically, these analytics are a part of a comprehensive workflow, which includes data preparation, model building, and model evaluation. General-purpose distributed dataflow frameworks execute all steps of such workflows holistically. This holistic view enables these systems to reason about and automatically optimize the entire pipeline. Here, graph and machine learning analytics are known to incur a long runtime since they require multiple passes over the data until convergence is reached. Thus, fault tolerance and a fast-recovery from any intermittent failure is critical for efficient analysis. In this paper, we propose novel fault-tolerant mechanisms for graph and machine learning analytics that run on distributed dataflow systems. We seek to reduce checkpointing costs and shorten failure recovery times. For graph processing, rather than writing checkpoints that block downstream operators, our mechanism writes checkpoints in an unblocking manner that does not break pipelined tasks. In contrast to the conventional approach for unblocking checkpointing (e.g., that manage checkpoints independently for immutable datasets), we inject the checkpoints of mutable datasets into the iterative dataflow itself. Hence, our mechanism is iteration-aware by design. This simplifies the system architecture and facilitates coordinating checkpoint creation during iterative graph processing. Moreover, we are able to rapidly rebound, via confined recovery, by exploiting the fact that log files exist locally on healthy nodes and managing to avoid a complete recomputation from scratch. In addition, we propose replica recovery for machine learning algorithms, whereby we employ a broadcast variable that enables us to quickly recover without having to introduce any checkpoints. In order to evaluate our fault tolerance strategies, we conduct both a theoretical study and experimental analyses u- ing Apache Flink and discover that they outperform blocking checkpointing and complete recovery.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2017.2690431","German Ministry for Education and Research; 10.13039/501100000064 - Berlin Big Data Center BBDC; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7891628","Fault tolerance;distributed data processing;graph processing;iterative computation;machine learning analytics","Distributed processing;Fault tolerance;Iterative methods;Machine learning","checkpointing;data flow computing;fault tolerance;graph theory;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence)","Apache Flink;checkpointing costs;data preparation;distributed iterative dataflow processing;failure recovery;fault tolerance;large-scale graph;machine learning;model building;model evaluation","","","","","","","20170403","Aug. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One main challenge is solving the joint problems of interference mitigation, user association, and resource allocation. These problems are formulated as an optimization which is then analyzed using two different approaches: Markov approximation and log-linear learning. However, finding the optimal solutions of both approaches requires complete information of the whole network which is not scalable with the network size. Thus, an approach based on a Markov approximation with a novel Markov chain design and transition probabilities is proposed. This approach enables the Markov chain to converge to the bounded near optimal distribution without complete information. In the game-theoretic approach, the payoff-based log-linear learning is used, and it converges in probability to a mixed-strategy ε-Nash equilibrium. Based on the principles of these two approaches, a highly randomized self-organizing algorithm is proposed to reduce the gap between optimal and converged distributions. Simulation results show that all of the proposed algorithms effectively offload more than 90 percent of the traffic from the macrocell base station to small cell base stations. Moreover, the results also show that the algorithms converge quickly irrespective of the number of possible configurations.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2016.2613864","10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; 10.13039/501100003725 - National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7577794","HetNets;Heterogeneous cellular networks;interference mitigation;resource allocation;user association","Algorithm design and analysis;Base stations;Buildings;Games;Interference;Markov processes;Resource management","Markov processes;approximation theory;cellular radio;game theory;interference suppression;optimisation;probability;radiofrequency interference;randomised algorithms;resource allocation","HetNet;Markov approximation;Markov chain design;bounded near optimal distribution;cellular system;game-theoretic approach;heterogeneous small cell-based network;interference mitigation coordination;log-linear learning;macrocell base station;mixed-strategy ε-Nash equilibrium;optimization;payoff-based log-linear learning;randomized self-organizing algorithm;resource allocation;small cell base stations;traffic offloading;transition probabilities;user association","","","","","","","20160927","Aug. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A subset of relays using alternate relaying is opportunistically selected in terms of producing the minimum total interference level, thereby resulting in network decoupling. As our main result, it is shown that under a certain relay scaling condition, the OND protocol achieves K degrees of freedom even in the presence of interfering links among relays. Numerical evaluation is also shown to validate the performance of the proposed OND.

To do so, we propose a set of noise features derived from the image chain acquisition and which can be used as CT-scanner footprint. Basically, we propose two approaches. The first one aims at identifying a CT scanner based on an original sensor pattern noise (OSPN) that is intrinsic to the X-ray detectors. The second one identifies an acquisition system based on the way this noise is modified by its three-dimensional (3-D) image reconstruction algorithm. As these reconstruction algorithms are manufacturer dependent and kept secret, our features are used as input to train a support vector machine (SVM) based classifier to discriminate acquisition systems. Experiments conducted on images issued from 15 different CT-scanner models of 4 distinct manufacturers demonstrate that our system identifies the origin of one CT image with a detection rate of at least 94% and that it achieves better performance than sensor pattern noise (SPN) based strategy proposed for general public camera devices.","2168-2194;21682194","","10.1109/JBHI.2016.2575398","¿¿¿333¿¿¿ Project; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100004608 - Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7487061","Computed tomography (CT);image origin identification;sensor pattern noise (SPN);three-dimensional (3-D) image reconstruction algorithm","Biomedical imaging;Computed tomography;Filtering algorithms;Image reconstruction;Reconstruction algorithms;Three-dimensional displays;X-ray imaging","computerised tomography;diagnostic radiography;feature extraction;image reconstruction;medical image processing;noise;support vector machines","3-D image reconstruction;CT;OSPN;SPN;SVM;X-ray detectors;computed tomography;image chain acquisition;image origin identification;original sensor pattern noise;sensor pattern noise;support vector machine","","","","","","","20160608","July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

First, a TV-L<sup>1</sup> form for flow estimation is defined using a combination of the brightness constancy and gradient constancy assumptions in the data term and by varying the weight under the Charbonnier function in the smoothing term. Second, to handle the potential risk of the outlier in the flow field, a general non-local term is added in the TV-L<sup>1</sup> optical flow model to engender the typical non-local TV-L<sup>1</sup> form.

The proposed non-local TV-L<sup>1</sup> optical flow model is performed in a linearizing iterative scheme using improved median filtering and a coarse-to-fine computing strategy. The results of the complex experiment indicate that the proposed method can overcome the significant influence of non-rigid motion, motion occlusion, and large displacement motion.

Cloud manufacturing (CMF) provides a cooperation platform for efficient utilization of distributed manufacturing resources in regional enterprise cluster. However, effective scheduling of tasks or subtasks to these resources is a challenging problem. Based on the analysis on the procedure of task processing, this paper proposes a CMF scheduling model for efficiently exploiting distributed resources, so industrial robots in different enterprises can cooperatively handle a batch of tasks. Specifically, this paper considers the performance of four robot deployment methods, including random deployment, robot-balanced deployment, function-balanced deployment, and location-aware deployment. Furthermore, three subtask-scheduling strategies are derived for three optimization objectives, including load-balance of robots, minimizing overall cost, and minimizing overall processing time. Moreover, these strategies are implemented by genetic algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that each strategy can achieve the relevant optimization objective. In addition, the results also show that the physical distance between two enterprises can influence the overall cost, and location-aware deployment leads to smaller transportation cost. Location-aware deployment and function-balanced deployment lead to smaller overall processing time for the low-workload state and high-workload state of the system, respectively.","1932-8184;19328184","","10.1109/JSYST.2015.2438054","2013 Special Fund of Guangdong Higher School Talent Recruitment; 2013 top Level Talents Project in &#8220;Sailing Plan&#8221; of Guangdong Province; 2014 Guangdong Province Outstanding Young Professor Project.

"Mining Coherent Topics With Pre-Learned Interest Knowledge in Twitter","Y. He; C. Wang; C. Jiang","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China","IEEE Access","20170623","2017","5","","10515","10525","Discovering semantic coherent topics from the large amount of user-generated content (UGC) in social media would facilitate many downstream applications of intelligent computing. Topic models, as one of the most powerful algorithms, have been widely used to discover the latent semantic patterns in text collections. However, one key weakness of topic models is that they need documents with certain length to provide reliable statistics for generating coherent topics. In Twitter, the users' tweets are mostly short and noisy. Observations of word co-occurrences are incomprehensible for topic models. To deal with this problem, previous work tried to incorporate prior knowledge to obtain better results. However, this strategy is not practical for the fast evolving UGC in Twitter. In this paper, we first cluster the users according to the retweet network, and the users' interests are mined as the prior knowledge. Such data are then applied to improve the performance of topic learning. The potential cause for the effectiveness of this approach is that users in the same community usually share similar interests, which will result in less noisy sub-data sets. Our algorithm pre-learns two types of interest knowledge from the data set: the interest-word-sets and a tweet-interest preference matrix. Furthermore, a dedicated background model is introduced to judge whether a word is drawn from the background noise. Experiments on two real life twitter data sets show that our model achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2696558","Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation for Young Teachers in the Higher Education Institutions of China; Shanghai Science and Technology Innovation Action Plan; 10.13039/501100001809 - Integrated Project for Major Research Plan of the National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100003024 - Shuguang Program from the Shanghai Education Development Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7941989","Topic model;short texts;social network","Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Data mining;Noise measurement;Semantics;Twitter","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;social networking (online);statistics;text analysis","Twitter;UGC;coherent topic mining;dedicated background model;documents;downstream applications;intelligent computing;interest-word-sets;latent semantic patterns;prelearned interest knowledge;retweet network;semantic coherent topic discovery;social media;statistics;text collections;topic learning;topic models;tweet-interest preference matrix;user clustering;user interest mining;user-generated content","","","","","","OAPA","20170607","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While effective in canceling interference, vectoring does incur major communication overhead and computational overhead in terms of the transmission of idle symbols and precoder-data multiplications at each data frame, resulting in significant energy consumption when the number of lines is large. To facilitate energy efficient transmission, it has been recently proposed (in the G.fast standard) that each data frame is divided into a normal operating interval (NOI) and a discontinuous operating interval (DOI). In the NOI, all lines (or users) are involved in a common vectoring group, which requires a large matrix precoder, whereas in the DOI, the lines are subdivided into multiple small nonoverlapping vectoring subgroups and are transmitted in a time division multiple access manner, requiring small matrix multiplications and, thus, improving the energy efficiency. In this paper, we consider the key dynamic resource allocation problems in downlink DSL: given the real-time demands, determine the optimal transmission scheme: The optimal NOI and DOI size in each data frame as well as the optimal grouping strategy in the DOI, and optimally adjust the transmission scheme. We formulate these optimal dynamic resource allocation problems and propose efficient real-time algorithms to solve them to global optimality.

Their multiple bridge machines work concurrently in their serially arranged and partially overlapping workspaces. To solve totally the job scheduling and collision resolution problems of MBMS, our prior work proposes a serial-colored traveling salesman problem (S-CTSP)-based method. Each salesman in S-CTSP visits his exclusive cities and some cities shared with his neighbor(s). To endow MBMS with fault-tolerance ability, this paper presents a two-stage method for both static path planning and dynamic collision avoidance of multiple machines. At the first stage, the path planning problem abstracted as an S-CTSP is solved by a population-based incremental learning (PBIL) algorithm. The PBIL introduces a local search operation, two types of possibility vectors, and a selection strategy of exclusive and shared cities. The second stage uses a Petri net supervisor to dynamically avoid any emerging collision when performing the scheduled work. This work also provides a novel priority net structure to prevent mutual waiting of two neighboring machines ready to enter their overlapping workspace. Then, we apply the presented method to a large tribridge waterjet cutting case to show its performance.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMC.2016.2531648","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7435349","Collision avoidance;Petri nets;colored traveling salesman problem;discrete event system;modeling and analysis;multibridge machining systems;multiple traveling salesman problem;path planning;population-based incremental learning","Collision avoidance;Job shop scheduling;Machining;Path planning;Petri nets;Robot kinematics","Petri nets;collision avoidance;control engineering computing;learning (artificial intelligence);production engineering computing;scheduling;search problems;travelling salesman problems;water jet cutting","MBMS;PBIL;Petri net supervisor;S-CTSP;collision resolution problems;dynamic collision avoidance;fault-tolerance ability;job scheduling;local search operation;multibridge machining systems;partially overlapping workspaces;path planning;population-based incremental learning algorithm;priority net structure;production capacity;serial-colored traveling salesman problem-based method;static path planning;tribridge waterjet cutting","","","","","","","20160317","July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To solve this problem, a new method based on online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) is proposed in this paper to predict online job termination status. With this method, real-time data are collected according to the sequence of job arriving, the job status could be predicted and the operation model is thus updated based on these data. The method with online incremental learning strategy has fast learning speed and good generalization. Comparative study using Google trace data shows that prediction accuracy of the proposed method is 93% with updating model in 0.01 s. Compared with some state-of-the-art methods, such, as support vector machine (SVM), ELM, and OS-SVM, the method developed in this paper has many advantages, such as less time-consuming in establishing and updating the model, higher prediction accuracy and precision, and better false negative performance.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2706740","Key Science and Technology Program of Henan Province; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China; National Science-Technology Support Plan Projects; Natural Science Research Projects of the Department of Education of Henan Province; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7932064","Cloud cluster;OS-ELM model;jobs termination status;online predicting;the Google cluster traces","Computational modeling;Data models;Google;Predictive models;Real-time systems;Support vector machines","cloud computing;computer centres;learning (artificial intelligence);resource allocation;system recovery","Google trace data;OS-ELM;compute cloud;disposal steps;job failure prediction;large-scale data center;machine learning-based prediction methods;offline working pattern;online incremental learning strategy;online job termination status prediction;online sequential extreme learning machine;operation model;resource utilization;time 0.01 s","","","","","","OAPA","20170519","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As various component/fiber failures may occur in hybrid FiWi networks, thus affecting huge numbers of end users, survivability has become one of the key important deployment considerations in such networks. This paper focuses on developing optimal network planning strategies to achieve survivable hybrid FiWi networks. In particular, to address the additional cost involved in deploying backup fibers in previously proposed redundancy strategies against distribution fiber failures, we propose the use of wireless routing through the ubiquitous wireless coverage of end users in a hybrid FiWi network. We present an optimization framework to optimally plan and deploy a survivable hybrid FiWi network, where traffic from an affected optical network unit (ONU) can be effectively rerouted to backup ONUs through wireless connections in the event of a distribution fiber failure. However, focusing only on the resilience of a network without considering its cost, and ignoring the resultant capacity, latency, and coverage under normal and protection operating conditions, is impractical. Our proposed framework therefore ensures maximum end-user coverage whilst satisfying survivability, connectivity, delay, and capacity constraints of the network, by optimizing the placement of passive optical splitters, ONUs, and wireless routers in conjunction with fiber and wireless connections. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of our framework in the context of an urban deployment under different deployment scenarios. In particular, our results provide insight into how survivable FiWi networks can be deployed without compromising on the latency, coverage, and capacity requirements of such networks.","1943-0620;19430620","","10.1364/JOCN.9.000466","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7947084","","Delays;Optical fiber devices;Optical network units;Optimization;Passive optical networks;Wireless communication","optical fibre networks;optimisation;telecommunication network planning","FiWi networks;ONU;component-fiber failures;distribution fiber failures;hybrid fiber wireless network;next-generation broadband access;optical network unit;optical networks;optimal network planning strategies;optimization framework;survivable deployment;ubiquitous access;ubiquitous wireless coverage;wireless connections;wireless networks;wireless routing","","","","","","","","June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Two criteria for the existence of globally exponentially stable periodic solutions are developed. The first one can deal with the case where no bounds on the derivative of the discrete delay are given, while the second one is a refined version of the first one when the discrete delay is constant. Both stability criteria possess several adjustable parameters, which will increase the flexibility for designing impulsive control laws. In particular, choosing appropriate adjustable parameters can lead to partial state impulsive control laws for certain periodic neural networks. The proof techniques employed includes two aspects. In the first aspect, by choosing a weighted phase space PC<sub>α</sub>, a sufficient condition for the existence of a unique periodic solution is derived by virtue of the contraction mapping principle. In the second aspect, by choosing an impulse-time-dependent Lyapunov function/functional to capture the dynamical characteristics of the impulsively controlled neural networks, improved stability criteria for periodic solutions are attained.

This work investigates how a simulation game should be designed to support the development of computational problem-solving strategies through the medium of learning fundamental computer science concepts, by proposing a theoretical game playing framework.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5467-1; POD:978-1-5090-5468-8; USB:978-1-5090-5466-4","10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7942991","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7942991","Open Sim;Scratch4SL;computational problem-solving;computing education;game-based learning","Computational modeling;Games;Problem-solving;Programming profession;Three-dimensional displays;Visualization","computer science education;interactive systems;serious games (computing)","computational problem-solving strategies;game making;game playing;game-based learning;interactive environments;introductory programming courses;simulation game","","","","","","","","25-28 April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Also, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are recognized as a good strategy to enhance engineering education. Nevertheless, MOOCs have two main weaknesses: first, lack of addressing personal goals; and second, low completion rates in comparison to the number of registrations to the MOOCs. To improve learning experiences in MOOCs and to strengthen self-regulated personalized learning we propose the application of gamification in MOOCs. Our assumption is that MOOC learners will better succeed in achieving their goals if they can individually personalize and plan their learning paths through gamification. This assumption is based on the implementation intention theory which claims that people who foster their goal intentions with implementation intentions are comparatively more successful in their personal goal achievements. Based on a preliminary literature review this article presents and arguments on our research idea on how to apply gamification to enhance MOOC users' goal achievement. Besides, it introduces a new perspective on MOOC completion rates based on the user intention and a new way of measuring it via the Personal Goal Achievement Ratio (PGAR) and the Overall Goal Achievement Ratio (OGAR).","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5467-1; POD:978-1-5090-5468-8; USB:978-1-5090-5466-4","10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7943070","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943070","MOOC;completion rate;gamification;goal achievement;implementation intention theory;user intention","Bars;Bibliographies;Context;Engineering education;Games;Training","courseware;educational courses;serious games (computing)","MOOC;MOOC completion rates;OGAR;PGAR;engineering education enhancement;gamification;implementation intention theory;learning experience improvement;massive open online courses;overall goal achievement ratio;personal goal achievement ratio;self-regulated personalized learning;user goal achievement enhancement","","","","","","","","25-28 April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The purpose of this research is to describe the design and development of relevant practical instruction which was introduced into one of the solar energy modules, termed Solar Energy Systems II. This module forms part of the curriculum of the new renewable energy course. The backward curriculum design method was applied in developing the practical instruction. Five learning outcomes were specified while three assessment strategies were selected, including oral presentations, written laboratory reports (headings include the experimental question, hypothesis, materials, procedure, observations, data, conclusion and reflections) and a final written class test. Two main pedagogical methods were used involving authentic learning and computer-based learning, while lectures, group work, videos and a learning management system were also used. A questionnaire was finally used to obtain student feedback on the practical instruction. Students indicated that the practical work was enjoyable (92%), relevant to the theory (83%), and a valuable learning experience (97%).

The dynamical stability of each defense and attack strategy pair is studied according to the replicator dynamics criteria to characterize the locally asymptotically stable equilibrium strategies.

The corresponding four-dimensional trajectory can be later computed from this aircraft intent. Special focus is given to the generation of vertical profiles. This approach is inspired by search strategies used in artificial intelligence: a search tree is generated to evaluate possible maneuvers at each point; and microstrategies are used to build this tree and decide what maneuvers might be possible. It will be shown that this process is flexible enough to meet the needs of many applications of trajectory prediction.

Because microexpressions are fleeting, lasting only a few frames within a video sequence, they are difficult to perceive and interpret correctly, and they are highly challenging to identify and categorize automatically. Existing recognition methods are often ineffective at handling subtle face displacements, which can be prevalent in typical microexpression applications due to the constant movements of the individuals being observed. To address this problem, a novel method called the Facial Dynamics Map is proposed to characterize the movements of a microexpression in different granularity. Specifically, an algorithm based on optical flow estimation is used to perform pixel-level alignment for microexpression sequences. Each expression sequence is then divided into spatiotemporal cuboids in the chosen granularity. We also present an iterative optimal strategy to calculate the principal optical flow direction of each cuboid for better representation of the local facial dynamics. With these principal directions, the resulting Facial Dynamics Map can characterize a microexpression sequence. Finally, a classifier is developed to identify the presence of microexpressions and to categorize different types. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate higher recognition performance and improved interpretability.","1949-3045;19493045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2016.2518162","Ministry of Education of China; 10.13039/100000001 - US National Science Foundation (NSF); 10.13039/100008321 - Pennsylvania State University; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100004543 - China Scholarship Council; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7383236","Microexpression;emotions;expression recognition;face recognition;optical flow","Adaptive optics;Cameras;Face;Frequency division multiplexing;Optical imaging;Strain;Tagging","emotion recognition;face recognition;image sequences","facial dynamics map;iterative optimal strategy;microexpression categorization;microexpression identification;microexpression sequences;optical flow estimation;pixel-level alignment;spatiotemporal cuboids","","","","","","","20170520","April-June 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Despite the significant success, one limitation to most of the existing ensemble clustering methods is that they generally treat all base clusterings equally regardless of their reliability, which makes them vulnerable to low-quality base clusterings. Although some efforts have been made to (globally) evaluate and weight the base clusterings, yet these methods tend to view each base clustering as an individual and neglect the local diversity of clusters inside the same base clustering. It remains an open problem how to evaluate the reliability of clusters and exploit the local diversity in the ensemble to enhance the consensus performance, especially, in the case when there is no access to data features or specific assumptions on data distribution. To address this, in this paper, we propose a novel ensemble clustering approach based on ensemble-driven cluster uncertainty estimation and local weighting strategy. In particular, the uncertainty of each cluster is estimated by considering the cluster labels in the entire ensemble via an entropic criterion. A novel ensemble-driven cluster validity measure is introduced, and a locally weighted co-association matrix is presented to serve as a summary for the ensemble of diverse clusters. With the local diversity in ensembles exploited, two novel consensus functions are further proposed. Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2017.2702343","Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar; NSFC; National Key Research Development Program of China; Ph.D. Start-up Fund of Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7932479","Cluster uncertainty estimation;consensus clustering;ensemble clustering;local weighting","Clustering algorithms;Estimation;Indexes;Partitioning algorithms;Robustness;Uncertainty","","","","","","","","","20170523","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Developing interference suppression strategies is critical for suppressing the inter-tier interference between remote radio heads (RRHs) and a macro base station (MBS) in H-CRANs. In this paper, inter-tier interference suppression techniques are considered in the contexts of collaborative processing and cooperative radio resource allocation (CRRA). In particular, interference collaboration (IC) and beamforming (BF) are proposed to suppress the inter-tier interference, and their corresponding performance is evaluated. Closed-form expressions for the overall outage probabilities, system capacities, and average bit error rates under these two schemes are derived. Furthermore, IC- and BF-based CRRA optimization models are presented to maximize the RRH-accessed users' sum rates via power allocation, which is solved with convex optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived expressions for these performance metrics for IC and BF are accurate, and the relative performance between IC and BF schemes depends on system parameters such as the number of antennas at the MBS, the number of RRHs, and the target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio threshold. Furthermore, it is seen that the sum rates of IC and BF schemes increase almost linearly with the transmit power threshold under the proposed CRRA optimization solution.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2497268","Beijing Natural Science Foundation; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); U.S. National Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7315024","Heterogeneous cloud radio access network;cooperative radio resource allocation;interference coordination;interference suppression","Cloud computing;Interference suppression;Radio access networks;Radio communication;Resource management","array signal processing;error statistics;interference suppression;optimisation;radio access networks;resource allocation","BF-based CRRA optimization;H-CRAN;IC-based CRRA optimization;MBS antennas;RRH;beamforming;bit error rates;cloud computing;collaborative processing;convex optimization;cooperative radio resource allocation;energy efficiency;heterogeneous cloud radio access networks;inter-tier interference suppression;interference collaboration;macro base station;outage probability;power allocation;remote radio heads;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;spectral efficiency;system capacity","","12","","26","","OAPA","20151102","2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Results of wind speed prediction (WSP) methods in the current literature are subject to errors due to the random nature of wind speed and the limited generalization of forecast algorithms. In this paper, a short-term WSP method based on a model of forecast, error correction, wind power generation, support vector machines (SVMs), and prediction algorithms is proposed. In the proposed method, the error model is built to predict the errors of the original predicted wind speed. Subsequently, the predicted errors are incorporated into the original predicted sequence to produce the final forecasts. The final predicted results can be brought to the system operator step by step for use in scheduling strategies. Using SVM and back propagation (BP) prediction algorithm as examples for the basic prediction algorithm, the proposed method is applied to a day-ahead WSP with five daily deliveries and compared with the results by a single SVM or a BP prediction algorithm.

Integrated with clustering strategies for crowding and speciation, two versions of this algorithm are developed, which operate at the niche level. Then these two algorithms are equipped with three distinctive techniques: 1) a dynamic cluster sizing strategy; 2) an alternative utilization of Gaussian and Cauchy distributions to generate offspring; and 3) an adaptive local search. The dynamic cluster sizing affords a potential balance between exploration and exploitation and reduces the sensitivity to the cluster size in the niching methods. Taking advantages of Gaussian and Cauchy distributions, we generate the offspring at the niche level through alternatively using these two distributions. Such utilization can also potentially offer a balance between exploration and exploitation. Further, solution accuracy is enhanced through a new local search scheme probabilistically conducted around seeds of niches with probabilities determined self-adaptively according to fitness values of these seeds. Extensive experiments conducted on 20 benchmark multimodal problems confirm that both algorithms can achieve competitive performance compared with several state-of-the-art multimodal algorithms, which is supported by nonparametric tests.

Both conventional thermal generators and wind turbines are taken into account in the ED model. By decomposing the centralized optimization into optimizations at local agents, a scheme is proposed for each agent to iteratively estimate a solution of the optimization problem in a distributed manner with limited communication among neighbors. It is theoretically shown that the estimated solutions of all the agents reach consensus of the optimal solution asymptomatically. This scheme also brings some advantages, such as plug-and-play property. Different from most existing distributed methods, the private confidential information, such as gradient or incremental cost of each generator, is not required for the information exchange, which makes more sense in real applications. Besides, the proposed method not only handles quadratic, but also nonquadratic convex cost functions with arbitrary initial values. Several case studies implemented on six-bus power system, as well as the IEEE 30-bus power system, are discussed and tested to validate the proposed method.","1949-3053;19493053","","10.1109/TSG.2015.2434831","Energy Research Institute@NTU; Major State Basic Research Development Program 973; Singapore¿s National Research Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7120161","Distributed optimization;economic dispatch (ED);finite-time consensus;plug-and-play;projected gradient","Cost function;Generators;Gradient methods;Smart grids;Wind power generation","gradient methods;optimisation;power generation dispatch;power generation economics;smart power grids;thermal power stations;wind power plants;wind turbines","ED model;IEEE 30-bus power system;centralized optimization;distributed ED strategy;distributed economic dispatch strategy;finite-time average consensus algorithm;generator gradient cost;generator incremental cost;information exchange;iterative estimation;nonquadratic convex cost function;plug-and-play property;private confidential informa- tion;projected gradient algorithm;random wind power;six-bus power system;smart grid system;thermal generators;wind turbines","","12","","31","","","20150609","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Question of how to understand a situation of physical system by estimating process parameters is largely unexplored. This paper is concerned with the distributed estimation problem for industrial automation over relay-assisted WSNs. Different from most existing works on WSN with homogeneous sensor nodes, the network considered in this paper consists of two types of nodes, i.e., sensing nodes (SNs), which is capable of sensing and computing, and relay nodes (RNs), which is only capable of simple data aggregation. We first adopt a Kalman filtering (KF) approach to estimate the unknown physical parameters. In order to facilitate the decentralized implementation of the KF algorithm in relay-assisted WSNs, a tree-based broadcasting strategy is provided for distributed sensor fusion. With the fused information, the consensus-based estimation algorithms are proposed for SNs and RNs, respectively. The proposed method is applied to estimate the slab temperature distribution in a hot rolling process monitoring system, which is a typical industrial CPS. It is demonstrated that the introduction of RNs improves temperature estimation efficiency and accuracy compared with the homogeneous WSN with SNs only.","2168-6750;21686750","","10.1109/TETC.2014.2386615","Ministry of Education, China; National Science Foundation of China; Science and Technology Commission through Shanghai Municipality, China; Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7004846","Consensus;Cyber-Physical System;Cyber-physical system;Estimation;Relay;Ubiquitous monitoring;Wireless sensor network;consensus;estimation;relay;ubiquitous monitoring;wireless sensor network","Estimation;Kalman filters;Monitoring;Relays;Sensors;Tin;Wireless sensor networks","Kalman filters;hot rolling;monitoring;parameter estimation;relay networks (telecommunication);temperature distribution;ubiquitous computing;wireless sensor networks","Kalman filtering;distributed estimation problem;hot rolling process monitoring system;industrial automation;industrial cyber-physical systems;relay nodes;relay-assisted wireless sensor networks;sensing nodes;slab temperature distribution;temperature estimation efficiency;tree-based broadcasting strategy;ubiquitous monitoring","","14","","32","","OAPA","20150108","Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In our current effort, we generalize our findings to a different population, a different learning material, and a different topic. In this study, we employ the tangible interface, Combinatorix (Fig. 1), which enables small groups of students to work collaboratively and discover concepts in probability. Our system supports students' explorations of principles in combinatorics (i.e., permutations and combinations) that serve as foundations for learning about probability. We describe the design of Combinatorix, as well as an experiment that examined the interaction between focused lectures and free exploration. We found that students who first explored the topic on a tangible interface and then watched a video lecture significantly outperformed students who watched a lecture first and then completed a hands-on activity.

Wild human faces vary with the poses, expressions, and illumination changes. All kinds of noises, like block occlusions, random pixel corruptions, and various disguises may also destroy the consistency of faces referring to the same person. This motivates us to develop a robust face clustering algorithm that is less sensitive to these noises. To retain the underlying structured information within facial images, we use tensors to represent faces, and then accomplish the clustering task based on the tensor data. The proposed algorithm is called robust tensor clustering (RTC), which firstly finds a lower-rank approximation of the original tensor data using a L1 norm optimization function. Because L1 norm does not exaggerate the effect of noises compared with L2 norm, the minimization of the L1 norm approximation function makes RTC robust. Then, we compute high-order singular value decomposition of this approximate tensor to obtain the final clustering results. Different from traditional algorithms solving the approximation function with a greedy strategy, we utilize a nongreedy strategy to obtain a better solution. Experiments conducted on the benchmark facial datasets and gait sequences demonstrate that RTC has better performance than the state-of-the-art clustering algorithms and is more robust to noises.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2376938","100 Talents Programme of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Doctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China; National Basic Research Program of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6995956","Disguise;face clustering;nongreedy maximization;occlusion;pixel corruption;tensor clustering","Approximation methods;Clustering algorithms;Face;Noise;Robustness;Tensile stress;Vectors","approximation theory;face recognition;greedy algorithms;optimisation;pattern clustering;singular value decomposition;tensors","L1 norm optimization function;RTC;block occlusions;high-order singular value decomposition;image managements;lower-rank approximation;nongreedy strategy;random pixel corruptions;robust face clustering algorithm;tensor decomposition;video analysis","0;Algorithms;Cluster Analysis;Face;Female;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Male;Pattern Recognition, Automated","5","","47","","","20141223","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since social learning is a key element of scalable education on MOOC and is done via online discussion forums, our main focus is on understanding forum activities. Two salient features of these activities drive our research: (1) high decline rate: for each course studied, the volume of discussion declined continuously throughout the duration of the course; (2) high-volume, noisy discussions: at least 30 percent of the courses produced new threads at rates that are infeasible for students or teaching staff to read through. Further, a substantial portion of these discussions are not directly course-related. In our analysis, we investigate factors that are associated with the decline of activity on MOOC forums, and we find effective strategies to classify threads and rank their relevance. Specifically, we first use linear regression models to analyze the forum activity count data over time, and make a number of observations; for instance, the teaching staff's active participation in the discussions is correlated with an increase in the discussion volume but does not slow down the decline rate. We then propose a unified generative model for the discussion threads, which allows us both to choose efficient thread classifiers and to design an effective algorithm for ranking thread relevance.

To avoid collisions among the concurrent transmissions, a contention-based multimedia delivery protocol is proposed, under which a MH is allowed to transmit only if its back-off timer is the smallest among its associated contenders. By applying tools from stochastic geometry, the transmission probability of MHs is derived and analyzed. We then characterize the coverage probability of the randomly requested files and thereby the successful content delivery probability of the cache-enabled D2D network. Based on the obtained results of successful content delivery probability, the optimal probabilistic caching strategy of MHs is investigated. Particularly, under the proposed contention-based multimedia delivery protocol, it is recommended to simply cache the most popular file at each MH to maximize the successful content delivery probability of the cache-enabled D2D network.

Among all existing technologies, the techniques for the fifth generation (5G) systems are the main driving force for the actualization of IoT concept. However, due to the heterogeneous environment in 5G networks and the broadcast nature of radio propagation, the security assurance against eavesdropping is a vital yet challenging task. In this paper, we focus on the transmission design for secure relay communications in IoT networks, where the communication is exposed to eavesdroppers with unknown number and locations. The randomize-and-forward relay strategy specially designed for secure multi-hop communications is employed in our transmission protocol. First, we consider a single-antenna scenario, where all the devices in the network are equipped with the single antenna. We derive the expression for the secrecy outage probability of the two-hop transmission. Following this, a secrecy-rate-maximization problem subject to a secrecy-outage-probability constraint is formulated. The optimal power allocation and codeword rate design are obtained. Furthermore, we generalize the above analyses to a more generic scenario, where the relay and eavesdroppers are equipped with multiple antennas. Numerical results show that the proper use of relay transmission can enhance the secrecy throughput and extend the secure coverage range.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2575863","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7484703","Internet of Things (IoT);physical layer security;relay transmission;resource allocation;stochastic geometry","5G mobile communication;Antenna measurements;Internet of things;Radio propagation;Resource management;Security;Sensors","5G mobile communication;Internet of Things;computer network reliability;computer network security;mobile antennas;probability;relay networks (telecommunication);transport protocols","5G networks;Internet of Things;IoT communication security enhancement;codeword rate design;eavesdropping;fifth generation systems;heterogeneous environment;optimal power allocation;radiopropagation;randomize-and-forward relay strategy;secrecy throughput enhancement;secrecy-outage-probability constraint;secrecy-rate-maximization problem;secure multihop communications;secure relay communications;security assurance;single-antenna scenario;transmission design;transmission protocol;two-hop transmission","","13","","38","","OAPA","20160607","2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This new paradigm of data hosting service also introduces new security challenges that require an independent auditing service to check the integrity of the data in the cloud. Some existing methods for checking the integrity of the data cannot handle this problem efficiently and they cannot deal with the error condition. Thus, a secure and efficient dynamic auditing protocol should reject requests that are made with improper authentication. In addition, an excellent remote data authentication method should be able to collect information for statistical analysis, such as validation results. In this paper, first we design an auditing framework for cloud storage systems and propose an efficient and privacy-preserving auditing protocol. Then, we extend our auditing protocol to support dynamic data operations, which is efficient and has been proven to be secure in the random oracle model. We extended our auditing protocol further to support bidirectional authentication and statistical analysis. In addition, we use a better load distribution strategy, which greatly reduces the computational overhead of the client.

Moreover, the running of SBS is adaptive according to the current evolutionary status. SBS is activated only when the population evolves slowly, depending on general genetic operators (e.g., mutation and crossover). A comprehensive set of 36 test problems is employed for experimental verification. The influence of two algorithm settings (i.e., the dimensionality and boundary relaxation strategy) and two probability parameters in SBS (i.e., the SBS rate and micro-jumping proportion) are investigated in detail.

The output tracking performance and closed-loop stability of the resulting INPC system are considered for two cases: 1) plant-model match case and 2) plant-model mismatch case. For the former case, the INPC system can achieve the same output tracking performance and closed-loop stability as those of the corresponding local control system. For the latter case, a sufficient condition for the stability of the closed-loop INPC system is derived using the switched system theory.

This study first proposed a novel approach based on the enhancement of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for facilitating the tradeoff multi-objective grouping optimization, and based on the proposed approach further developed a web-based group support system to help educators for adequate grouping of homogeneous inter-group and heterogeneous intra-group. In addition, the distribution of learners in the class was considered for group formation. Two types of experiments were conducted; one involved a performance analysis against a GA and the Random approach, and the other entailed a study on CL with 90 participants. The experimental results showed the following: 1) The proposed approach is not only more effective than a GA and the Random approach but also more efficient than a GA. 2) As a grouping strategy, the proposed approach can facilitate improved learning performance with statistical significance; in other words, the developed system is able to adequately allocate learners to teams for facilitating CL.","1939-1382;19391382","","10.1109/TLT.2015.2471995","National Science Council of the Republic of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7229323","Collaborative learning (CL);IT applications;collaborative learning (CL);decision support;evolutionary computing;genetic algorithms (GAs)","Biological cells;Complexity theory;Computers;Filling;Genetic algorithms;Niobium;Optimization","Internet;TOPSIS;computer aided instruction;genetic algorithms;groupware;random processes","TOPSIS;Web-based group support system;benefit objective;class rank;collaborative learning;cost objective;genetic algorithm;heterogeneous intragroup;homogeneous intergroup;learning achievement;random approach;technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution;tradeoff multiobjective grouping optimization","","0","","39","","","20150828","April-June 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To provide efficient cooperation strategies in C-RANs, individual C-RAN clusters are formed by the remote radio heads (RRHs), and a data-assisted channel estimation scheme is studied, which can reduce the redundant cost of training sequences. To ensure the performance of channel estimation and data transmissions, the cluster formation and the channel estimation are optimized jointly. In particular, an iterative training-based channel estimation scheme is designed by using convex optimization and the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm jointly. Moreover, a utility function of cluster formation can be established based on the estimates and the mean squared error of our proposed channel estimation algorithm, and the cluster formation of RRHs can be formulated as a coalitional formation game.

Compared with a traditional business process, an emergency response process has its own features. To our best knowledge, there is no formal method to model and analyze emergency response processes by taking uncertain activity execution duration, resource quantity, and resource preparation duration into account. This paper presents such a method based on an E-Net that is a Petri net-based formal model for an emergency response process constrained by resources and uncertain durations. According to the number of available resources, execution of an E-Net is classified into the worst, delayed, and best cases. Based on a priority-activity-first strategy and corresponding algorithms, this paper finds the duration to execute each activity for the delayed case. By experiments, we prove that the proposed strategy can ensure shorter execution duration of the whole process than a conventional one.

The most popular is the pursuit scheme that pursues the estimated optimal action and penalizes others. This paper proposes a reverse philosophy that leads to last-position elimination-based learning automata (LELA). The action graded last in terms of the estimated performance is penalized by decreasing its state probability and is eliminated when its state probability becomes zero. All active actions, that is, actions with nonzero state probability, equally share the penalized state probability from the last-position action at each iteration. The proposed LELA is characterized by the relaxed convergence condition for the optimal action, the accelerated step size of the state probability update scheme for the estimated optimal action, and the enriched sampling for the estimated nonoptimal actions. The proof of the E-optimal property for the proposed algorithm is presented. Last-position elimination is a widespread philosophy in the real world and has proved to be also helpful for the update scheme of the learning automaton via the simulations of well-known benchmark environments. In the simulations, two versions of the LELA, using different selection strategies of the last action, are compared with the classical pursuit algorithms Discretized Pursuit RewardInaction (DPRI) and Discretized Generalized Pursuit Algorithm (DGPA). Simulation results show that the proposed schemes achieve significantly faster convergence and higher accuracy than the classical ones. Specifically, the proposed schemes reduce the interval to find the best parameter for a specific environment in the classical pursuit algorithms. Thus, they can have their parameter tuning easier to perform and can save much more time when applied to a practical case. Furthermore, the convergence curves and the corresponding variance coefficient curves of the contenders are illustrated to characterize their essent- al differences and verify the analysis results of the proposed algorithms.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2309478","China National Science Foundation (NSF); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Basic Research Program of China; PRC Ministry of Science and Technology; Shanghai NSF; U.S. NSF; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6782439","Last-position elimination;learning automata (LA);stationary environments;update scheme","Accuracy;Automata;Convergence;Indexes;Learning automata;Pursuit algorithms;Vectors","learning automata;probability;vectors","LELA;convergence curves;discretized generalized pursuit algorithm;discretized pursuit reward-inaction;e-optimal property;last action selection strategies;last-position elimination-based learning automata;nonzero state probability;penalized state probability;pursuit scheme;state probability vector update scheme;variance coefficient curves","1;Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Decision Support Techniques;Game Theory;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reward","29","","57","","","20140402","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In GCES, multimodal optimization problems are regarded as classification ones, and Gaussian mixture models are employed to save the locations and basins of already and presently identified local or global optima. A sequential estimation technique for the covariance of a Gaussian model is introduced into GCES. To best adjust the global step size, a strategy named top-ranked sample selection is introduced, and a classification method instead of a common but problematic radius-triggered manner is proposed. Experiments are performed on a series of benchmark test functions to compare GCES with the state-of-the-art multimodal optimization approaches.

An approach to face this problem is to provide teachers with strategies that allow them to design meaningful games for their learning scenarios. To address this issue, a metaphor has been proposed for supporting teachers in the design of the so-called location-based learning games. In this study, we describe four real learning contexts, including 16 secondary education teachers use the proposed metaphor to design their own location-based games. Besides, in order to gain meaningful insights about the impact of the designed games in students' satisfaction, we deployed the teachers' designs in “QuesTInSitu: The Game”.

It remains a challenging task to accurately distinguish foreign fibers from cotton. This paper proposes an efficient recognition system to accurately recognize foreign fibers mixed in cotton. The core component of the proposed system is an efficient classifier based on the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM). A two-step grid search strategy, which integrates a coarse search with a fine search, is adopted to train an optimal KELM recognition model. The resultant model is compared with the support vector machine and extreme learning machine on a real data set using tenfold cross-validation analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed recognition system can achieve classification accuracy as high as 93.57%, which is superior to the other two state-of-the-art systems. The results clearly confirm the superiority of the developed model in terms of classification accuracy. Promisingly, the proposed system can serve as a new candidate of powerful foreign fiber recognition systems with excellent performance.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2615520","Guangdong Natural Science Foundation; Key Laboratory of Symbolic Computation and Knowledge Engineering of Ministry of Education Foundation of Jilin University; Science and Technology Plan Project of Wenzhou of China; 10.13039/100007847 - Jilin Province Natural Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100004731 - Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100007162 - Guangdong Science and Technology Plan Project; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7587382","Foreign fibers in cotton;kernel extreme learning machine;online recognition system","Analytical models;Cotton;Kernels;Machine learning;Recommender systems;Search problems;Support vector machines;Textile products","cotton;fibres;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);production engineering computing;search problems;support vector machines;textile products","KELM image recognition model;cotton textile product;cross-validation analysis;foreign fiber recognition system;image classification;kernel extreme learning machine;support vector machine;two-step grid search strategy","","","","","","OAPA","20161010","2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Traditionally, the redundant energy will be wasted if it cannot be consumed by power load. In fact, the redundant energy can be stored to supply power loads in the future. For this end, we investigate cooperative energy transportation and storage for IoEs in terms of problem analysis, algorithm design, and platform development. After demonstrating the feasibility condition and proving the NP-hard of our problem, we derive the optimal solution by the reduction from a classic knapsack problem.

The competitions have been designed such that participants develop their own AI module on top of public/commercial games. Because the materials are open to the public, it is quite useful to adopt them for an undergraduate course project. In this paper, we report our experiences using the Angry Birds AI Competition for such a project-based course. In the course, teams of students consider computer vision, strategic decision-making, resource management, and bug-free coding for their outcome. To promote understanding of game contents generation and extensive testing on the generalization abilities of the student's AI program, we developed software to help them create user-created levels.

In order to achieve high CD accuracy, spatial information such as texture and morphological profiles are utilized in conjunction with spectral information.

Soft computing can be used as an alternative to the analytical approach, as it offers advantages such as no required knowledge of internal system parameters, compact solutions for multivariable problems, and fast calculation. Because precipitation prediction is a crucial problem, a process which simulates precipitation with two soft-computing techniques was constructed and presented in this paper, namely, adaptive neurofuzzy inference (ANFIS) and support vector regression (SVR). In the current study, polynomial, linear, and radial basis function (RBF) are applied as the kernel function of the SVR to estimate the probability of precipitation. The performance of the proposed optimizers is confirmed with the simulation results. The SVR results are also compared with the ANFIS results.

Furthermore, this agent-based approach allows using new manufacturing concepts in scheduling problems because of its scalability, ability to negotiate, and distributed capabilities. However, MAS models have the drawback of excessive dependence on up-to-date field information. In this paper, a theoretical and experimental MAS is presented to test new strategies for managing handling operations supported by radio-frequency identification information feedback. Based on this new visibility framework, these strategies applied to scheduling control have been structured on a new distributed organization model to enforce the idea of the division between physical elements and information and communication technologies.

Many anomaly detectors have been proposed, and most of them are based on a Reed-Xiaoli (RX) detector, which assumes that the spectrum signature of HSI pixels can be modeled with Gaussian distributions. However, recent studies show that the Gaussian and other unimodal distributions are not a good fit to the data and often lead to many false alarms. This letter proposes a novel hyperspectral AD algorithm based on local sparsity divergence (LSD) without any distribution hypothesis. Our algorithm exploits the fact that targets and background lie in different low-dimensional subspaces and that targets cannot be effectively represented by their local surrounding background. A sliding dual-window strategy is first adopted to construct local spectral and spatial dictionaries, which enable the extraction of the sparse coefficients of each HSI pixel. Then, a consistent sparsity divergence index is proposed to compute the LSD map at each spectral band separately. Finally, joint segmentation of LSD maps over different bands is performed for AD.

A reflection mechanism is used to abstract the resource scheduling process as a metaobject. Petri nets are used to construct the base layer model, meta layer model, metaobject protocol, and other components, thus forming the resource scheduling model. The adaptive resource scheduling strategy is converted into CTL formulas, and the properties are analyzed.

A risk factor (RF) is used to define a quantitative measure of risk. A set of failure data is applied to compute the maximum likelihood estimates of Weibull parameters that are fitted into the RF. MATLAB algorithms are used to simulate sensitivities of the RF to changes in the number of components renewed and the number admitted to or relieved from a high-operating-load regime during the life cycle. The model determines the impacts of renewal strategies on failure risk by trending risk profiles associated with these sensitivities. In addition, it provides modeling equations for the systems thinking approach which has, traditionally, used qualitative models. Furthermore, it is flexible since the computed parameters are unique to the set of data. These parameters thus generate equally unique plots of probability distribution functions that are required for analysis of reliability and risk.

With ATSDWA, tasktrackers can adapt to the change of load at runtime, obtain tasks in accordance with the computing ability of their own, and realize the self-regulation, while avoiding the complexity of algorithm, which is the prime reason to make jobtracker the system performance bottleneck. Experimental results show that ATSDWA is a highly efficient and reliable algorithm, which can make heterogeneous Hadoop clusters stable, scalable, efficient, and load balancing. Furthermore, its performance is superior to the original and improved task scheduling strategy of Hadoop, from the aspects of the execution time of tasks, the resource utilization, and the speed-up ratio.","1932-8184;19328184","","10.1109/JSYST.2014.2323112","Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Natural Science Fund of Higher Education of Jiangsu Province; Special Fund for Fast Sharing of Science Paper in Net Era by CSTD; State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002858 - China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6832443","Adaptive scheduling;clustering methods;computational efficiency;distributed computing;dynamic scheduling","Cloud computing;Dynamic scheduling;Heart beat;Real-time systems;Scheduling algorithms","cloud computing;data handling;parallel processing;scheduling","ATSDWA;cloud computing;heterogeneous Hadoop clusters;load balancing;novel adaptive task scheduling strategy based on dynamic workload adjustment","","0","","28","","","20140612","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, these systems might be deceived (or spoofed) and, despite the recent advances in spoofing detection, current solutions often rely on domain knowledge, specific biometric reading systems, and attack types. We assume a very limited knowledge about biometric spoofing at the sensor to derive outstanding spoofing detection systems for iris, face, and fingerprint modalities based on two deep learning approaches. The first approach consists of learning suitable convolutional network architectures for each domain, whereas the second approach focuses on learning the weights of the network via back propagation. We consider nine biometric spoofing benchmarks - each one containing real and fake samples of a given biometric modality and attack type - and learn deep representations for each benchmark by combining and contrasting the two learning approaches. This strategy not only provides better comprehension of how these approaches interplay, but also creates systems that exceed the best known results in eight out of the nine benchmarks. The results strongly indicate that spoofing detection systems based on convolutional networks can be robust to attacks already known and possibly adapted, with little effort, to image-based attacks that are yet to come.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2398817","Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES) DeepEyes Project; Minas Gerais Research Foundation; 10.13039/501100001807 - S¿o Paulo Research Foundation; 10.13039/501100003593 - Federal University of Ouro Preto through the Brazilian National Research Council; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7029061","Back-propagation;Convolutional Networks;Deep Learning;Deep learning;Filter Weights Learning;Hyperparameter Architecture Optimization;Spoofing Detection;back-propagation;convolutional networks;filter weights learning;hyperparameter architecture optimization;spoofing detection","Benchmark testing;Computer architecture;Face;Feature extraction;Fingerprint recognition;Iris recognition;Optimization","biometrics (access control);face recognition;fingerprint identification;iris recognition","biometric reading systems;biometric spoofing benchmarks;convolutional network architectures;deep representations;domain knowledge;face detection;fingerprint spoofing detection;global security;image based attacks;iris detection;national security;person authentication;person identification;personal security;spoofing detection","","36","","90","","","20150202","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Meanwhile, a time-varying offset is introduced in an event-triggered function with the purpose of excluding the potential Zeno behavior closed to consensus and relaxing the conservative theoretical threshold. Moreover, a sufficient condition is established for ensuring the consensus, and infinite triggers within a finite time are verified to be impossible.

This is because a relay node (RN) has the advantage of providing more cooperation diversity and a better two-hop cooperation channel than a one-hop direct transmission channel. To this aim, various RN selection algorithms are researched and proposed. Although the benefit of employing RN to wireless networks has been well studied, unfortunately, it introduces some adverse effect at the same time. In this paper, one of these adverse impacts as flow-level cooperation competition (FCC) incurred by RN in CT mode has been investigated. The main problem of FCC is that it may lead to CT mode that is not as beneficial as expected. Considering the pros and cons, an RN in a multiple-hop wireless networks with a game theoretic framework is analyzed, and its performance is investigated. Following this, a Nash equilibrium based strategy is proposed in the process of employing an RN. With this technique, a maximum system performance is achieved, namely, the Nash equilibrium cooperative transmission strategy (NECTS). NECTS guarantees the gain of each flow but also effectively maximizes system performance. Simulation results show that NECTS uses the advantage of cooperative communications but avoids the unnecessary competition. Therefore, the proposed NECTS outperforms the conventional methods.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2016.2602501","Advanced and Applied Basic Research Projects of Chongqing; Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University; Chongqing Key Laboratory; Open Research Fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University; Science and Technology Research Project of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7551148","Cooperative transmission (CT);Nash equilibrium strategy;flow-level cooperation competition (FCC);relay node (RN)","FCC;Games;Mobile computing;Nash equilibrium;Relays;Throughput;Wireless networks","cooperative communication;game theory;radio networks;relay networks (telecommunication);wireless channels","CT mode;FCC;NECTS;Nash equilibrium cooperative transmission strategy;RN selection algorithm;cooperation diversity;cooperative communication;flow-level cooperation competition;game theoretic framework;maximum system performance;multiple-hop wireless network;one-hop direct transmission channel;relay node selection algorithm;two-hop cooperation channel","","","","","","","20160824","May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we take one step forward by investigating the construction of feed-forward denoising convolutional neural networks (DnCNNs) to embrace the progress in very deep architecture, learning algorithm, and regularization method into image denoising. Specifically, residual learning and batch normalization are utilized to speed up the training process as well as boost the denoising performance. Different from the existing discriminative denoising models which usually train a specific model for additive white Gaussian noise at a certain noise level, our DnCNN model is able to handle Gaussian denoising with unknown noise level (i.e., blind Gaussian denoising). With the residual learning strategy, DnCNN implicitly removes the latent clean image in the hidden layers. This property motivates us to train a single DnCNN model to tackle with several general image denoising tasks, such as Gaussian denoising, single image super-resolution, and JPEG image deblocking. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our DnCNN model can not only exhibit high effectiveness in several general image denoising tasks, but also be efficiently implemented by benefiting from GPU computing.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2017.2662206","HK RGC GRF; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Scientific Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839189","Image denoising;batch normalization;convolutional neural networks;residual learning","Computational modeling;Image denoising;Neural networks;Noise level;Noise reduction;Training;Transform coding","AWGN;Gaussian processes;feedforward neural nets;image denoising;learning (artificial intelligence);neural net architecture","DnCNN model;GPU computing;Gaussian denoiser;JPEG image deblocking;additive white Gaussian noise;batch normalization;deep CNN;discriminative denoising models;discriminative model learning;feedforward denoising convolutional neural networks;image denoising;learning algorithm;regularization method;residual learning strategy;single image super-resolution;training process;unknown noise level;very deep architecture","","","","","","","20170201","July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These NVM technologies have attractive features, such as low latency and high throughput to satisfy application performance. Accordingly, fast storage devices based on fast NVM lead to a rapid increase in the demand for diverse computer systems and environments (e.g., cloud platforms, web servers, and database systems) where they are expected to be used as primary storage. Despite the promised benefits provided by fast storage devices, modern file systems do not take advantage of the storage's full performance. In this article, we analyze and explore existing I/O strategies in read, write, journal I/ O, and recovery paths between the file system and the storage device. The analysis shows that existing I/O strategies are an obstacle to get maximum performance of fast storage devices. To address this issue, we propose efficient I/O strategies that enable file systems to fully exploit the performance of fast storage devices. Our main idea is to transfer requests from discontiguous host memory buffers in the file systems to discontiguous storage segments in one I/O request to get maximize I/O performance. We implemented our scheme to read, write, journal I/O and recovery operations in the EXT4 file system and the JBD2 module. We demonstrate the implication of our idea in terms of application performance through well-known benchmarks.

Digital signature is a widely used technique to protect messages' authenticity and nodes' identities. From the practical perspective, to ensure the quality of services in wireless mobile networks, ideally the process of signature verification should introduce minimum delay. Batch cryptography technique is a powerful tool to reduce verification time. However, most of the existing works focus on designing batch verification algorithms for wireless mobile networks without sufficiently considering the impact of invalid signatures, which can lead to verification failures and performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a Batch Identification Game Model (BIGM) in wireless mobile networks, enabling nodes to find invalid signatures with reasonable delay no matter whether the game scenario is complete information or incomplete information. Specifically, we analyze and prove the existence of Nash Equilibriums (NEs) in both scenarios, to select the dominant algorithm for identifying invalid signatures. To optimize the identification algorithm selection, we propose a self-adaptive auto-match protocol which estimates the strategies and states of attackers based on historical information. Comprehensive simulation results in terms of NE reasonability, algorithm selection accuracy, and identification delay are provided to demonstrate that BIGM can identify invalid signatures more efficiently than existing algorithms.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2016.2604820","Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University, Riyadh; Key Laboratory of Aerospace Information Security and Trusted Computing; Major State Basic Research Development Program of China; National High Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China; 10.13039/100000001 - US National Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7556995","Batch identification;game theory;wireless mobile networks","Algorithm design and analysis;Communication system security;Delays;Games;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Wireless communication","cryptography;digital signatures;game theory;mobile radio;quality of service;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","BIGM;NE reasonability;Nash equilibriums;algorithm selection accuracy;batch cryptography technique;batch identification game model;batch verification algorithm;digital signature;identification algorithm selection;identification delay;message authenticity protection;node identity;quality of services;self-adaptive auto-match protocol;signature verification;wireless mobile networks","","1","","","","","20160831","June 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this technical note we introduce a strategy that employs time-varying adaptation gains (as well as time-varying control gains, when appropriate) and achieves exponential regulation of the plant state, with an exponential rate that is uniform in the initial condition. This idea fundamentally differs from exponential stability results achieved in the presence of PE because we make the gains (rather than reference signals) time-varying, i.e., we use time-varying tools in a multiplicative (rather than in an additive) fashion.

Thus, the final classifier in our method is trained with positive, negative, and unlabeled base samples, which is a semisupervised learning framework. A block optimization strategy is further introduced to learn a manifold regularization-based correlation filter for efficient online tracking.

The latter is modeled in a probabilistic framework to account for the uncertainty in the building occupancy. The energy management task essentially consists in the minimization of the energy consumption of the cooling system, while preserving comfort in the building. This is achieved by a twofold strategy. The cooling power request is optimally distributed among the chillers and the thermal storage unit. At the same time, a slight modulation of the temperature set-point of the zone is allowed, trading energy saving for comfort. The problem can be decoupled into a static optimization problem (mainly addressing the chiller plant optimization) and a dynamic programming (DP) problem for a discrete time stochastic hybrid system (SHS) that takes care of the overall energy minimization. The DP problem is solved by abstracting the SHS to a (finite) controlled Markov chain, where costs associated with state transitions are computed by simulating the original model and determining the corresponding energy consumption. A numerical example shows the efficacy of the approach.","1545-5955;15455955","","10.1109/TASE.2016.2635109","project LO1506 of the Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports; 10.13039/501100000780 - European Commission through the UnCoVerCPS project; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7814233","Approximate dynamic programming (DP);Markov chain (MC) abstraction;cooling systems;energy management;stochastic hybrid systems (SHSs)","Buildings;Cooling;Dynamic programming;Energy management;Optimization;Stochastic processes;Thermal management","Markov processes;buildings (structures);dynamic programming;energy conservation;energy consumption;energy management systems;minimisation;space cooling;thermal energy storage","building cooling system;building occupancy;chiller plant;controlled Markov chain;cooling load;discrete time stochastic hybrid system;dynamic programming problem;energy consumption minimization;energy management system;energy saving;overall energy minimization;probabilistic framework;static optimization problem;thermal storage unit","","","","","","","20170111","April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Paid Prioritization and Its Impact on Net Neutrality","R. T. B. Ma; J. Wang; D. M.

The concern is that the differentiation imposed by selfish ISPs might discriminate content providers (CPs) and harm social welfare. Although market competition among ISPs would alleviate the problem and moderate the necessity for net neutrality regulations, the problem remains in monopolistic access markets. We focus on such a market and study paid prioritization where CPs voluntarily pay for prioritizing their traffic under shared capacity. We study an ISP's pricing strategy, CPs' choices of priority, and the resulting system equilibrium, based on which we derive the utility of the ISP and CPs as well as social welfare. This paper shows that: 1) an ISP's optimal pricing leads to an efficient differentiation among CPs, such that social welfare is close to its maximum; 2) although ISPs might inhibit capacity deployment in the short run, price regulation could solve this issue; and 3) under medium system scale and capacity cost, ISPs would have strong incentives to expand capacity under paid prioritization. From a welfare perspective, our results suggest that paid prioritization could be superior to the imposition of net neutrality regulations.","0733-8716;07338716","","10.1109/JSAC.2017.2659020","Hong Kong RGC; Ministry of Education of Singapore AcRF; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7835173","Internet economics;net neutrality;paid prioritization;priority queueing;service differentiation","Broadband communication;Economics;Internet;Measurement;Network neutrality;Pricing;Throughput","Internet;pricing;telecommunication traffic","ISP;Internet content traffic;Internet service provider;content providers;market competition;medium system scale;monopolistic access markets;net neutrality regulations;paid prioritization;price regulation;pricing strategy;system equilibrium","","1","","","","","20170126","Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Aggregate function computation and iceberg queries are important and common in many applications of data mining and data warehousing because people are usually interested in looking for unusual patterns by computing aggregate functions across many attributes. In spite of complexity of these queries decision makers want their request to be processed quickly. But these queries often require very long response time. So it is very important to process efficiently these expensive queries with aggregate functions in data warehousing environment. Presently available Iceberg query (IBQ) processing techniques faces the problem of empty Bitwise AND operation, and require more I/O access to execute query. None of the research provides the model for all aggregate functions. Proposed research applies look ahead matching strategy on Bitmap Index (BI) of query attributes. Before performing actual operation the analysis of logical operation is done if it satisfy threshold condition then only complete operation will be perform. In this way look ahead matching(LAM) strategy reduces the I/O access cost and solve the problem of empty bitwise AND operation.

Most existing video fingerprinting methods use a single feature or concatenate different features to generate video fingerprints, and show good performance under single-mode modifications such as noise addition and blurring. However, when they suffer combined modifications, the performance is degraded to a certain extent because such features cannot characterize the video content completely. By contrast, the assistance and consensus among different features can improve the performance of video fingerprinting. Therefore, in the present study, we mine the assistance and consensus among different features based on a tensor model, and we present a new comprehensive feature to fully use them in the proposed video fingerprinting framework. We also analyze what the comprehensive feature really is for representing the original video. In this framework, the video is initially set as a high-order tensor that consists of different features, and the video tensor is decomposed via the Tucker model with a solution that determines the number of components. Subsequently, the comprehensive feature is generated by the low-order tensor obtained from tensor decomposition. Finally, the video fingerprint is computed using this feature. A matching strategy used for narrowing the search is also proposed based on the core tensor. The robust video fingerprinting framework is resistant not only to single-mode modifications but also to their combination.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2016.2629758","Fostering Project of Dominant Discipline and Talent Team of Shandong Province Higher Education Institutions; NSFC Joint Fund with Guangdong under Key Project; Shandong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100007129 - Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7745950","Comprehensive feature;multiple features;near-duplicate video detection (NDVD);robust video fingerprinting","Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Fingerprint recognition;Media;Robustness;Sun;Tensile stress","feature extraction;fingerprint identification;image matching;image representation;object detection;tensors;video signal processing","NDVD;Tucker model;content-based near-duplicate video detection;feature-based robust video fingerprinting;high-order tensor;low-order tensor;matching strategy;tensor decomposition;tensor model;video content;video representation;video tensor","","1","","","","","20161116","April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Storage burden is minimized due to small size i.e. 160 bit BLS signature. External auditor called Third Party Auditor (TPA) is used for auditing purpose. So, that user can use cloud data without worrying about its integrity. In our model privacy of user's data is also preserved from third party auditor because while verifying integrity TPA does not have any knowledge about user's data.

These operations can be performed efficiently by normalizing the database. By normalization, the tables in a database are organized in a well-structured manner that reduces the generation of redundant data as well as ensures that the data dependencies make sense, i.e., all the functional dependencies are satisfied. It is observed that students find it difficult to understand the concepts of normal forms while learning a Database Management Course and also they find it difficult to obtain smaller well-structured relations by applying normalization concept. Very few commercial design tools are available to assist students in learning Normalization. Consequence is a big challenge for educators, in both, teaching as well as motivating students in learning Data Base Design. Keeping in mind all these aspects, we decided to develop an intelligent tutor, which will teach users the process of normalization and help them in normalizing the databases. While solving the problems, the tutor will also provide hints and feedback, if the user demands. The tutor also keeps track of the performance of the user to plan its teaching strategies.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3291-4; POD:978-1-5090-3292-1","10.1109/ICCUBEA.2016.7860013","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7860013","ITS;database;normalization","Computers;Design tools;Education;Problem-solving;Relational databases;Systems architecture","computer science education;database management systems;educational courses;intelligent tutoring systems","commercial design tools;data base design;data dependencies;database management course;database normalization;functional dependencies;intelligent tutoring system;normalization concept;redundant data;teaching strategies","","","","","","","","12-13 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we first identify the underlying strategies used by the existing data center transports, namely, in-network Prioritization (used in pFabric), Arbitration (used in PDQ), and Self-adjusting at Endpoints (PASE) (used in DCTCP). We show that these strategies are complimentary to each other, rather than substitutes, as they have different strengths and can address each other's limitations. Unfortunately, prior data center transports use only one of these strategies. As a result, they either achieve near-optimal performance or deployment friendliness (i.e., require no changes to the data plane) but not both. Based on this insight, we design a data center transport protocol called PASE, which carefully synthesizes these strategies by assigning different transport responsibilities to each strategy. The key advantage of PASE over prior art is that it achieves both near-optimal performance as well as deployment friendliness. PASE does not require any changes in network switches (hardware or software); yet, it achieves comparable, or even better, performance than the state-of-the-art protocols (such as pFabric) that require changes to network elements. Our evaluation results show that the PASE performs well for a wide range of application workloads and network settings.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2016.2586508","Jiangsu High-Level Innovation and Entrepreneurship (Shuangchuang) Program; 10.13039/100000001 - National Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100004681 - Higher Education Commission of Pakistan; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7569011","Datacenter;TCP;congestion control;latency","Art;Computer science;Hardware;IEEE transactions;Throughput;Transport protocols","computer centres;computer networks;transport protocols","PASE;data center transport protocols;near-optimal data center transport;self-adjusting at endpoints","","","","","","","20160915","Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The method considers both sampling scale of a point and relations among points, and is proven to be solvable by graph cuts.

However, almost all the existing RFID estimation protocols are dedicated to the estimation problem on a single set, regardless of tag categories. A feasible solution is to separately execute the existing estimation protocols on each category. The execution time of such a serial solution is proportional to the number of categories, and cannot satisfy the delay-stringent application scenarios. Simultaneous RIFD estimation over multiple categories is desirable, and hence, this paper proposes an approach called simultaneous estimation for multi-category RFID systems (SEM). SEM exploits the Manchester-coding mechanism, which is supported by the ISO 18000-6 RFID standard, to decode the combined signals, thereby simultaneously obtaining the reply status of tags from each category. As a result, multiple bit vectors are decoded from just one physical slotted frame. Built on our SEM, many existing excellent estimation protocols can be used to estimate the tag cardinality of each category in a simultaneous manner. To ensure the predefined accuracy, we calculate the variance of the estimate in one round, as well as the variance of the average estimate in multiple rounds. To find the optimal frame size, we propose an efficient binary search-based algorithm. To address significant variance in category sizes, we propose an adaptive partitioning (AP) strategy to group categories of similar sizes together and execute the estimation protocol for each group separately. Compared with the existing protocols, our approach is much faster, meanwhile satisfying the predefined estimation accuracy. For example, with 20 categories, the proposed SEM+AP is about seven times faster than prior estimation schemes. Moreover, our approach is the only one whose normalized esti- ation time (i.e., time per category) decreases as the number of categories increases.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2016.2594481","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Japan Ministry of Information and Communication through the Strategic Information and Communications Research and Development Promotion Program titled ¿Living Activity and Health Tracking in Smart Home using RF Reflection and Big Data,¿ 2016-2018; Jiangsu Future Internet Program; Jiangsu High-Level Innovation and Entrepreneurship (Shuangchuang) Program; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Advanced Networking, Tianjin, China; 10.13039/100000001 - NSF; 10.13039/501100001809 - NSFC; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - State Key Program of National Natural Science of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7574264","Manchester coding;RFID;adaptive partitioning;cardinality estimation;multi-category","Computer science;Electronic mail;Encoding;Estimation;IEEE transactions;Protocols;Radiofrequency identification","protocols;radiofrequency identification","ISO 18000-6 RFID standard;Manchester-coding mechanism;RFID estimation protocols;adaptive partitioning strategy;multicategory RFID estimation;multicategory radio frequency identification estimation","","1","","","","","20160922","Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to the uneven distribution of input data, tasks with more data become stragglers and delay the overall job completion. Running Hadoop in a private cloud opens up opportunities for expediting stragglers with more resources but also introduces problems that often outweigh the performance gain: (1) performance interference from co-running jobs may create new stragglers; (2) there exists a semantic gap between the Hadoop task management and resource pool-based virtual cluster management preventing tasks from using resources efficiently. In this paper, we strive to make Hadoop more resilient to data skew and more efficient in cloud environments. We present FlexSlot, a usertransparent task slot management scheme that automatically identifies map stragglers and resizes their slots accordingly to accelerate task execution. FlexSlot adaptively changes the number of slots on each virtual node to balance the resource usage so that the pool of resources can be efficiently utilized. FlexSlot further improves mitigation of data skew with an adaptive speculative execution strategy. Experimental results show that FlexSlot effectively reduces job completion time up to 47.2 percent compared to stock Hadoop and two recently proposed skew mitigation and speculative execution approaches.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2016.2587641","10.13039/100000001 - NSF; 10.13039/100000001 - US National Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7506079","MapReduce, cloud, data skew, stragglers, task slot management, speculative execution","Acceleration;Cloud computing;Containers;Dynamic scheduling;Interference;Resource management;Semantics","cloud computing;data handling;parallel programming;resource allocation;software performance evaluation;virtualisation","FlexSlot;Hadoop task management;MapReduce;automatic map straggler identification;cloud environments;flexible slot management;load imbalance;parallel programs;performance interference;private cloud;resource pool-based virtual cluster management;resource usage balancing;skew mitigation;speculative execution;task execution acceleration;user-transparent task slot management","","","","","","","20160707","March 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Whereas almost all related protocols rely to some extent on the assistance of intermediate nodes for relaying message copies towards their destination, the generation of new message copies may either involve them or be carried out exclusively by the message source. This paper first formulates and solves analytical models for the performance of the two most popular message spraying strategies under imperfect node cooperation and homogeneous exponentially distributed pairwise node inter-contact times. Numerical results suggest that as the node cooperation decreases source replication consistently outperforms binary replication, i.e., the optimal variant of intermediate node-assisted replication under nominal conditions of full node cooperation. The analytical conclusions are also verified for more realistic node mobility patterns through trace-driven experimentation. We then formulate the ideal selection of replication mode as a finite-horizon Continuous Time Markov Decision Process with restricted decision epochs and solve it for the optimal spraying policy. The optimal policy coincides with the binary-(source-) spraying in the presence of few (resp. many) misbehaving nodes. To better approximate it at intermediate levels of misbehavior intensity, we introduce and analyze a simple static spraying policy permitting source-destination space-time paths of up to three hops. Our work deepens the understanding of a core operation embedded in a broad range of multi-copy DTN forwarding protocols. At the same time, it advocates a more thorough approach to the design and evaluation of DTN forwarding that accounts for beyond-nominal conditions.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2016.2567388","ERC08-RECITAL project; Hellenic national funds; NSRF; Operational Program Education and Lifelong Learning; 10.13039/501100004895 - European Social Fund; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7470544","Markov decision processes;Message replication;opportunistic forwarding","Analytical models;Context;Markov processes;Mobile computing;Protocols;Relays;Spraying","Markov processes;cooperative communication;delay tolerant networks;mobility management (mobile radio);protocols","binary replication;binary-source-spraying;delay tolerant network;distributed pairwise node intercontact times;finite-horizon continuous time Markov decision process;imperfect node cooperation;intermediate node-assisted replication;intermediate nodes;message source;message spraying strategies;multicopy DTN forwarding protocols;multicopy message forwarding schemes;node mobility patterns;opportunistic networks;optimal message replication;optimal spraying policy;source-destination space-time paths;static spraying policy","","","","","","","20160517","March 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Consequently, students may delay enrolling in programming courses, which interrupts progress towards their degree and decreases confidence in their ability to succeed in college and computing careers. One strategy to overcome the perceived and actual difficulties undergraduate students encounter in an introductory programming course is to participate in a summer Programming Boot Camp (PBC). PBC is a short-term, intense event focused on improving Java programming skills, providing career and professional development, and building a stronger network with faculty, peers, and industry experts. In this paper, we describe the structure and format of a weeklong PBC held at Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC) for female computing undergraduates. We report on the impacts of the program in terms of increasing confidence, improving programming skills, and encouraging student engagement.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3419-2; POD:978-1-5090-3420-8","10.1109/RESPECT.2016.7836170","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7836170","broadening participation;programming boot camp;retention;women in technology","Buildings;Delays;Engineering profession;Java;Organizations;Programming profession","Java;computer science education;educational courses;gender issues;professional aspects;programming","IT;Java programming skills;PBC;career development;college career;computing career;introductory programming course;professional development;programming boot camp;programming courses;student engagement;women","","","","","","","","11-13 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The freedom given to learners in this exploration context leads to a variety of learner approaches for constructing models and makes modelling of learner behaviour a challenging task. To address this issue, we propose a learner modelling mechanism for monitoring learners’ actions when constructing/exploring models by modelling sequences of actions reflecting different strategies in solving a task. This is based on a modified version of case-based reasoning for problems with multiple solutions. In our formulation, approaches to explore the task are represented as sequences of simple cases linked by temporal and dependency relations, which are mapped to the learners’ behaviour in the system by means of appropriate similarity metrics. This paper presents the development and validation of the modelling mechanism. The model was validated in the context of an ELE for mathematical generalisation using data from classroom sessions and pedagogically-driven learning scenarios.","1939-1382;19391382","","10.1109/TLT.2017.2661310","ESRC EPSRC Teaching and Learning Research Programme; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839926","Intelligent/ Adaptive learning systems;case-based reasoning;evaluation;learner modelling;mathematics","Adaptation models;Analytical models;Context;Context modeling;Data models;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model","","","","","","","","CCBY","20170202","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

A critical barrier in providing computer science learning opportunities to all is the dearth of professionals who have the expertise to teach computer science. Blended learning approaches have the potential to reduce this barrier by facilitating the distribution of expertise across distances. In this poster we present our approach to understanding how to design blended learning models for the informal space that take advantage of the expertise of adult mentors and computer science experts. Our theoretical framing is based on Nacu et al. (2014) adult mentor roles, which suggest that adults play different roles (e.g., encourager, monitor, broker) to support students learning. We use Minecraft, a popular, 3D, online, multiplayer game, as our study context. The poster presents two studies that investigate ways of facilitating mentorship in a blended learning environment to teach computational thinking. Study 1 focuses on documenting the roles mentors play while facilitating a computer science-related Minecraft workshop with middle school students. Study 2 focuses on understanding how these roles are modified when online and in person mentors work together to facilitate a computational learning opportunity. Our initial findings suggest that defining a scalable model to support blended learning models in informal spaces requires a variety of mentor roles. Additionally, when coordinating mentorship across mediums, gaps in student support can arise when there is a lack of (a) explicit strategies of communication in place between in-person and online mentors; and (b) clearly defined roles assigned to mentors.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3419-2; POD:978-1-5090-3420-8","10.1109/RESPECT.2016.7836181","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7836181","","Computational modeling;Computer science;Electronic mail;Games;Media;Monitoring;Three-dimensional displays","computer aided instruction;computer games;computer science education;teaching","3D online multiplayer game;adult mentors;blended learning;blended mentorship;computational thinking;computer science expertise;computer science experts;computer science learning opportunities;computer science-related Minecraft;informal space;middle school students;teaching","","","","","","","","11-13 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the space-domain MoM, the electric current density is represented with the Rao-WiltonGlisson (RWG) basis function, while the magnetic current density is expanded by the n̂×RWG basis function, which may not be good, since it is not divergenceor curl-conforming. Also, the MoT scheme has a well-known late-time instability problem, which will aggravate in timedomain surface integral equations with penetrable media. We present a different strategy to solve the TDEFIEs by using the Nyström method to discretize the space domain and using the Galerkin method with Laguerre basis and testing functions to discretize the time domain.

Such problems become more serious for novices. In particular, it is important but difficult to sufficiently understand the differences between search intentions and actual browsing situations. Moreover, there is often insufficient mutual understanding of differences in search policies between members of collaborative exploration since they tend to superficially confirm the search results.

Moreover, to ensure the power and signal transfer without unacceptable interference or attenuation, a parameters selection method of the communication channel is developed. In addition, an interference suppression strategy by taking the interference from the ipsilateral channel into consideration is proposed. To suppress the interference effectively, an estimation of the ipsilateral channel output signal is made. Then, the signal from the opposite channel is demodulated by removing the estimated values of the interference.

Most IQA evaluation mechanisms are based on the pertinence of subjective and objective estimation. Each image distortion type has its own property correlated with human perception. However, this intrinsic property may not be fully exploited by existing IQA methods. In this paper, we make two main contributions to the IQA field. First, a novel IQA method is developed based on a local linear model that examines the distortion between the reference and the distorted images for better alignment with human visual experience. Second, a distortion-specific compensation strategy is proposed to offset the negative effect on IQA modeling caused by different image distortion types. These score offsets are learned from several known distortion types. Furthermore, for an image with an unknown distortion type, a convolutional neural network-based method is proposed to compute the score offset automatically. Finally, an integrated IQA metric is proposed by combining the aforementioned two ideas. Extensive experiments are performed to verify the proposed IQA metric, which demonstrate that the local linear model is useful in human perception modeling, especially for individual image distortion, and the overall IQA method outperforms several state-of-the-art IQA approaches.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2016.2639451","Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at the Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7782841","Image quality assessment;convolutional neural network;distortion-specific compensation;human visual system;local linear model","Computational modeling;Correlation;Distortion;Image quality;Measurement;Neural networks;Visualization","computer vision;convolution;neural nets","IQA evaluation mechanisms;computer vision;convolutional neural network-based method;distortion-specific compensation strategy;human perception modeling;human visual experience;image distortion types;image processing;image quality assessment;intrinsic property;local linear information;objective estimation;score offset;subjective estimation","","","","","","","20161214","Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we present a secure system architecture design as our initial effort toward this direction, which bridges together the advancements of video coding techniques and secure deduplication. Our design enables the cloud with the crucial deduplication functionality to completely eliminate the extra storage and bandwidth cost, which would have been incurred by hosting encrypted videos from different entities. The design is also carefully tailored to the scalable video coding (SVC) techniques to support heterogeneous networks and devices for high-quality adaptive video dissemination. We show fully functional system implementations with structure-aware encryption design and structure-aware deduplication strategies that are both completely compliant with the video format in SVC.

Adopting two populations to cooperatively optimize the two subcomponents, two prediction methods, i.e., differential prediction and Cauchy mutation, are then employed respectively to speed up their responses on the change of the environment. Furthermore, two improved dynamic multi-objective optimization algorithms, i.e., DNSGAII-CO and DMOPSO-CO, are proposed by incorporating the above strategy into NSGA-II and multi-objective particle swarm optimization, respectively.

Researchers discovered that heating can cause worn-out NAND flash cells to become reusable and greatly extend the lifetime of flash memory cells. However, the heating process consumes a substantial amount of power, and some fundamental changes are required for existing NAND flash management techniques. In particular, all existing wear-leveling techniques are based on the principle of evenly distributing writes and erases. For self-healing NAND flash, this may cause NAND flash cells to be worn out in a short period of time. Moreover, frequently healing these cells may drain the energy quickly in battery-driven mobile devices, which is defined as the concentrated heating problem. In this paper, we propose a novel wear-leveling scheme called DHeating (Dispersed Heating) to address the problem. In DHeating, rather than evenly distributing writes and erases over a time period, write and erase operations are scheduled on a small number of flash memory cells at a time, so that these cells can be worn out and healed much earlier than other cells. In this way, we can avoid quick energy depletion caused by concentrated heating. In addition, the heating process takes several seconds and has become the new performance bottleneck. In order to address this issue, we propose a lazy heating repair scheme. The lazy heating repair scheme can ease the long time delays caused by the heating via delaying the heating operation and using the system idle time to repair. Furthermore, the flash memory's reliability becomes worse with the flash memory cells reaching the excepted worn-out time. We propose an early heating strategy to solve the reliability problem. With the extended lifetime provided by self-healing, we can trade some lifetimes for reliability. The idea is to start the healing process earlier than the expected worn-out time- We evaluate our scheme based on an embedded platform. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can effectively prolong the consecutive heating time interval, alleviate the long time delays caused by the heating, and enhance the reliability for self-healing flash memory.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2016.2595572","Chongqing High-Tech Research Program; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Guangdong Natural Science Foundation; National 863 Program; Natural Science Foundation of SZU; Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China; Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China; Shenzhen Natural Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002369 - Chongqing; 10.13039/501100002369 - Chongqing University; 10.13039/501100004377 - Hong Kong Polytechnic University; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524803","Flash memory;dispersed heating;power consumption;self-healing;wear leveling","Delay effects;Heating;Logic gates;Maintenance engineering;Reliability;Silicon;Substrates","NAND circuits;circuit reliability;flash memories;heating","DHeating;NAND flash management;embedded platform;heating dispersal;lazy heating repair scheme;reliability enhancement;self-healing NAND flash memory;wear-leveling scheme","","","","","","","20160728","Feb. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To provide a good learning environment, it is important to simulate the employees managed by the player as realistically as possible. However, existing approaches only use simple models to simulate human behavior, missing psychological aspects like motivation and interpersonal interaction, and therefore are not detailed enough for leadership and project management training. We present a new decision-making model based on findings of psychology, which can be used for simulating a more realistic human behavior. We use heuristics for calculating the motivational force of all potential actions an employee has, in order to decide which he will choose. This calculation is not only based on the project's state and schedule, but also on emotional factors like the preferences and aversions of the employee.

As a result, they were not cost-efficient. This paper introduces video segmentation and proposes a segment-based storage and transcoding trade-off strategy for multi-version VoD systems in the cloud. First, we split each video into multiple segments depending on the video internal popularity. Second, we describe the transcoding relationships among versions using a transcoding weighted graph, which can be used to calculate the version-aware transcoding cost from one version to another. Third, we take the video segmentation, version-aware transcoding weighted graph, and video internal popularity into account to propose a storage and transcoding trade-off strategy, which stores multiple versions of popular segments and transcodes unpopular segments. We then formulate it as an optimization problem and present a heuristic divide-and-conquer algorithm to get an approximate optimal solution. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the solution; the results show that it can significantly lower the storage and transcoding cost of multi-version VoD systems.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2016.2612123","Changjiang Scholars Program of MOE; Coordinator Innovation Project for the Key Lab of Shaanxi Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; MOE Innovation Research Team; MOE Online Education Research Fund; National High Technology Research and Development Program 863 of China; National Key Technologies R&D Program of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100004543 - China Scholarship Council; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7572977","Cloud;multi-version video-on-demand (VoD);segment-based;storage and transcoding trade-off;transcoding weighted graph","Bandwidth;Delays;Industries;Real-time systems;Static VAr compensators;Streaming media;Transcoding","cloud computing;costing;divide and conquer methods;graph theory;optimisation;storage management;transcoding;video coding;video on demand","cloud;heterogeneous clients;heuristic divide-and-conquer algorithm;multiple-bitrate streaming services;multiversion VoD systems;multiversion video-on-demand provider;optimization problem;segment-based storage;storage cost;transcoding computation cost;transcoding relationships;transcoding trade-off strategy;version-aware transcoding cost;version-aware transcoding weighted graph;video internal popularity;video segmentation","","","","","","","20160921","Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The analysis of these data can enhance our understanding of cellular processes. PPI network alignment is one of the comparative analysis methods for analyzing biological networks. Research on PPI networks can identify conserved subgraphs and help us to understand evolutionary trajectories across species. Some evolutionary algorithms have been proposed for coping with PPI network alignment, but most of them are limited by the lower search efficiency due to the lack of the priori knowledge. In this paper, we propose a memetic algorithm, denoted as MeAlgn, to solve the biological network alignment by optimizing an objective function which introduces topological structure and sequence similarities. MeAlign combines genetic algorithm with a local search refinement. The genetic algorithm is to find interesting alignment solution regions, and the local search is to find optimal solutions around the regions. The proposed algorithm first develops a coarse similarity score matrix for initialization and then it uses a specific neighborhood heuristic local search strategy to find an optimal alignment. In MeAlign, the information of topological structure and sequence similarities is used to guide our mapping. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can achieve a better mapping than some state-of-the-art algorithms and it makes a better balance between the network topology and nodes sequence similarities.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2015.2511741","Fundamental Research Fund for the Central Universities; National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals of China; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7364202","Memetic algorithm;biological network alignment;genetic algorithm;local search","Algorithm design and analysis;Biological system modeling;Genetic algorithms;Memetics;Proteins;Search problems","bioinformatics;data mining;genetic algorithms;molecular biophysics;proteins","PPI data;PPI network alignment;biological network data;cellular process;evolutionary algorithm;genetic algorithm;global biological network alignment;memetic algorithm;protein-protein interaction;search refinement;similarity score matrix","","","","","","","20151223","November 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Because most parameters of the metabolic network cannot be directly measured, they must be estimated by using optimization algorithms. However, three characteristics of the metabolic network model, i.e., high nonlinearity, large amount parameters, and huge variation scopes of parameters, restrict the application of many traditional optimization algorithms. As a result, there is a growing demand to develop efficient optimization approaches to address this complex problem. In this paper, a Kriging-based algorithm aiming at parameter estimation is presented for constructing the metabolic networks. In the algorithm, a new infill sampling criterion, named expected improvement and mutual information (EI&MI), is adopted to improve the modeling accuracy by selecting multiple new sample points at each cycle, and the domain decomposition strategy based on the principal component analysis is introduced to save computing time. Meanwhile, the convergence speed is accelerated by combining a single-dimensional optimization method with the dynamic coordinate perturbation strategy when determining the new sample points. Finally, the algorithm is applied to the arachidonic acid metabolic network to estimate its parameters. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in getting precise parameter values under a limited number of iterations.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2015.2505291","General Project of Liaoning Province Department of Education Science Research; National Basic Research Program of China; National Natural Science Funds of China; Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Dalian Neusoft University of Information; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346425","Kriging model;Metabolic network;dynamic coordinate perturbation;parameter estimation;single-dimensional optimization","Algorithm design and analysis;Biochemistry;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Heuristic algorithms;Optimization;Parameter estimation","biochemistry;statistical analysis","arachidonic acid;domain decomposition strategy;dynamic coordinate perturbation strategy;expected improvement and mutual information;kriging-based parameter estimation algorithm;metabolic network model;molecular mechanism;principal component analysis;single-dimensional optimization method","","","","","","","20151203","November 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Nevertheless, the dropout rate of courses delivered by the World Wide Web (Web) used to be very high, mainly for the ones delivered by MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses). The reasons for that rely on several causes, mostly the ones related to the difficulty of students adapting themselves to the routine of individual studies. Therefore, finding strategies to deal with this difficulty may mitigate dropout rate in web-based learning. In this paper, we describe a systematic review of the literature to find evidences for the relevance of proposing a model to support web-based courses and foster collaboration between pairs as a mean to address the top three problems identified as reasons for the high dropout in distance learning.

The first team, which consisted of six students, were designing a patient lift system to be used by a semi-paralyzed lady in the local community. The second team, which consisted of five students, was working on a low-cost, motorized wheelchair for a client in India. Using a mixed methods approach, we collected data through nine different sources: Engineering Design Metacognitive Questionnaire (EDMQ), Canvas™ course webpage, an e-Journal, written interviews, participants' weekly presentations, journey maps, participants' cloud storage (Google Docs and Box), and participant-researcher-email communications. These digital data (i.e., voice, video, image, and text documents) are safely stored digitally in our secure network storage. This preliminary report addresses one major research question: In what ways do students actively employ self-regulated learning during design activities of a capstone senior design course. We drew upon Butler & Cartier's model of self-regulation and Dym & Little's design process frameworks to answer this question. The analysis used 48 e-Journal entries as its main source. We classified participants' entries by their design processes and activities; two engineering experts assisted in categorizing dubious records. Our data and interpretations were triangulated against other data sources during these processes to increase corroboration of our collected data. Our preliminary findings suggest that (1) groups' efforts were focused in conceptual design and project management activities, (2) groups' design processes were dynamics, and (3) management activities were reported throughout the project time. Further analysis will include other data sources, especially transcripts of st- dents' weekly presentations, journey maps, and written interview responses, to uncover teams' self-regulation strategies during the design process.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1790-4; POD:978-1-5090-1791-1","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757481","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757481","engineering design;self-regulation","Context;Instruments;Interviews;Monitoring;Planning;Project management;Wheelchairs","aerospace engineering;cloud computing;computer aided instruction;control engineering education;educational courses;engineering education;mechanical engineering;project management;team working;wheelchairs","Butler-Cartier model;Canvas course Webpage;Dym-Little design process framework;EDMQ;Google Box;Google Docs;India;aerospace engineering capstone design course;capstone design courses;capstone senior design course;classroom environment;conceptual design;digital data;e-journal;engineering design metacognitive questionnaire;journey map;low-cost motorized wheelchair;mechanical engineering;participant cloud storage;participant weekly presentation;participant-researcher-email communication;patient lift system design;project management;project teams;project time;secure network storage;self-regulated learning;self-regulation strategy;semiparalyzed lady;senior engineering students;student self-regulation;written interview","","","","","","","","12-15 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Research studies have shown that assessment methods also influence students' learning. Current assessment techniques, even those which include technology, focus more on summative assessment rather than formative. Formative assessment is necessary for teaching and assessment of complex skills like troubleshooting or network design. Therefore, there exists a need for assessments to capture students' problem solving process and chosen approaches during the assessment. By tracking a student's behaviors in an immersive assessment environment, the path that the student takes towards the solution can be studied. Virtual Worlds are naturally immersive environments and can be effectively used to record interactions that students made in the worlds. We have developed NetWorld in Open Wonderland, an open source software for creating 3D virtual worlds. NetWorld is a 3D virtual world built for detailed assessment of computer network concepts for computer science undergraduate students.

Within this scenario, a practical and dynamic learning system is being fostered that allows simulations to be carried out in real contexts through problem resolution. Based on constructivist theories, PBL (Problem-Based Learning) is a teaching method that is focused on the students and its main characteristic is that it uses real-world problems to create the learning content and teach the skills required for their solution. However, the adoption of this approach is not an easy task, since it is accompanied by abrupt changes in the traditional paradigm of education, which require changes in the attitudes of the actors involved. In addition, the planning and monitoring of the PBL, involve complex activities that are difficult to manage, especially with regard to determining the quality and compliance of the processes used for problem resolution. Additionally, the Computer Science courses require working on projects provided by real clients, within a dynamic and iterative development process. This strengthens the need to introduce strategies and technologies to support the implementation and management of the method and, enable its effectiveness to be monitored In addition, it provides continuous feedback, and assesses the results generated from the evaluation of the solutions produced during the teaching-learning process. Thus, it is essential to adopt strategies that allow a better management of teaching practice, improved learning by the students and a means of validating the clients involved. From this perspective, this paper presents a virtual teaching and learning environment, called PBLMaestro, which has been designed to support the workflow of a methodology for the implementation of PBL in teaching Computer Science, called xPBL. With the aid of xPBL, it is possible to perform the management of courses using the dy- amics of a cycle and series of stages to allow a better control of management processes, by linking real problems to well-defined educational goals. In the case of teacher planning, we were used elements described in xPBL methodology, aligned with educational goals defined from the Bloom Revised Taxonomy. With regard to student tracking, we used the authentic assessment model and mechanisms of Learning Analytics. Gamification strategies were included to increase engagement, retention and motivation, and push notification messages were displayed in a mobile application the PBLMaestro was validated by means of application the environment in the context of the discipline “Network Design” of Computer Science Course, and the results are analyzed in this study. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the teachers and there was a high degree of satisfaction among the tutors, students and customers who used the service, with regard to the usability and consistency of the proposed environment as well as with its improvements and changes. Although the environment was improved in the area of computer science, it is possible that it can provide support to the STEM context with some customizations.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1790-4; POD:978-1-5090-1791-1","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757388","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757388","Computer Science;Gamification;PBLMaestro;Problem-Based Learning;Virtual Learning Environment","Collaboration;Computational modeling;Computer science;Context;Education;Monitoring;Planning","STEM;computer aided instruction;computer science education;data analysis;educational courses;serious games (computing)","Bloom revised taxonomy;PBLMaestro;STEM context;business corporations;computer education;computer science course;computer science courses;continuous feedback;dynamic learning system;educational goals;educational model;gamification strategies;iterative development process;learning analytics;learning content;market practices;network design;problem resolution;problem-based learning approach;teaching method;teaching-learning process;virtual learning environment;virtual teaching;xPBL","","","","","","","","12-15 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A main issue is to support learners setting up their own learning goals, managing their own resources, including spaces and time, and monitoring and reflecting about their performance. Time management plays a main role in this approach. During the last years many web tools and mobile apps have been developed to support students managing their agendas, recording the time they devote to different activities and visualizing it in attractive graphics. In general these systems provide a view of the activities performed by the student in a particular system and the time devoted to each activity. In this paper we propose a contribution on this subject focused on two issues: self-regulation and interoperability. We are working towards the recording of online and offline student activities not just taking into account the functionalities or resources used, but also the goals, strategies, tasks or rewards considered from a SRL point of view. From the interoperability point of view, our goal is to support the tracking from different systems using a specific SRL xAPI profile.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1790-4; POD:978-1-5090-1791-1","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757411","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757411","Application Profile;Learning Analytics;Learning Strategy;Self-Regulated Learning;Time Management","Data visualization;Interoperability;Monitoring;Planning;Reflection;Software;Student activities","Internet;computer aided instruction;data visualisation;mobile computing;teaching","SRL xAPI profile;Web tools;autonomous lifelong learners;competent development;learner setting;learning goals;mobile apps;offline student activities;online student activities;self-regulated learners;teaching;time management tracking;time management visualization","","","","","","","","12-15 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a two-granularity inspection-based software rejuvenation policy, which works as a closed-loop control technique, is proposed. This policy mitigates the negative impact of two-level software aging. The two levels considered are the user-level applications and the operating system. A Markov regenerative process model is constructed based on the system condition. We obtain the degradation rate of the application software and operating system from fault injection experiments. The diagnostic accuracy of the adopted monitor and analysis system, which is applied to inspect the application software and operating system, is considered as we provide the optimal rejuvenation strategies. Finally, the availability and the overall loss probability with their corresponding optimal inspection time intervals are obtained numerically based on the parameter values estimated from the experiments. Experimental results show that two-granularity software rejuvenation is much more effective than traditional single-level software rejuvenation. In our experimental study, when two-granularity software rejuvenation is used, the unavailability and the overall loss probability of the system were reduced by 17.9% and 2.65%, respectively, in comparison with the single-level rejuvenation.","0018-9529;00189529","","10.1109/TR.2016.2570539","Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project; Digital Confidence Plan (Digital Agency of Spain); Spanish National Institute of Cybersecurity (INCIBE); U.S. National Science Foundation; University of Le¿n; 10.13039/100006112 - Microsoft Research; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100003593 - CNPq; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7493613","Diagnostic accuracy;Markov regenerative process (MRGP);multigranularity software aging;overall loss probability;software rejuvenation","Aging;Analytical models;Computer bugs;Markov processes;Operating systems;Robustness","Markov processes;operating systems (computers);probability;software engineering","Markov regenerative process model;closed-loop control technique;operating system;overall loss probability;proactive software control technique;two-granularity software rejuvenation policy;two-level software aging;user-level applications","","","","","","","20160616","Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proponents conducted experiments to predict the students' final rating based on their history of accessing the data in the university LMS. Based on the derived model, the score obtained from the participation in the online activities was the most valuable influencer for learning outcomes of the DE learners. Thus, the successful completion of the program depends on how the students interact with the activities posted in the LMS.

Although the emerging interest of developing countries in these topics is evident, much work has to be done to promote the national scientific production and the availability of scientific contents without restrictions. As a vehicle for knowledge sharing, National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) play a key role in science growth and Open Access (OA) deployment. In addition, the Current Research Information System (CRIS) has emerged as an embracing paradigm for managing the multitude of science components and players. Instantiating these concepts and directives in the science ecosystems of developing countries will allow to save years of progress, bringing these countries directly into a high-level regarding science management. In this context, taking Mozambique as a case study, this work discusses the problematic of science growth in developing countries and identifies hurdles and strategies for building OA repositories supported by the Mozambican NREN MoRENet, and for implementing technological platforms for managing science.

In this paper, a power user classification strategy of multi-view clustering is proposed. It does the cluster analysis for the power data from the points of load fluctuations indicators and real-time load curves. Clustering results of load fluctuations indicators can be drawn on the basis of the characteristics of users' load fluctuations indicators in every business.

Their proposals include different m-learning adoption factors and extensions to improve the original TAM and UTAUT models. This is a problem for scholars who need to be informed of the most important factors, or if they wish to use these scientific results for their m-learning development, evaluation, research and/or teaching strategies. For these reasons, this paper presents a literature review of the factors that determine m-learning adoption. We then depict an integration of the validated factors by each author and their relationships within a new and more complete model. As a result of our review, we propose a taxonomy or classification of these adoption factors into three categories: pedagogical, technological and students' aspects.

In addition, we investigate downtilts of antenna patterns at the base stations. To further improve the throughput of massive MIMO networks, we propose a beam switching tilting strategy which adopts different downtilts to serve each divided vertical region. A partition time-slots algorithm is developed according to the number of users in each region.

Most of the algorithms do not scale well with the number of objectives due to the expansion of the objective space. In this paper, a hybrid evolutionary algorithm with dual populations (HEA-DP) is proposed to tackle many-objective problems. The algorithm combines the advantages of decomposition-based and indicator-based approaches by maintaining two populations. The fitness values of individuals in the first population are determined by an aggregation function, while individuals in the second population are evaluated according to an efficient performance indicator. The information about the objective space is shared by employing a reproduction strategy that chooses parents from both populations. In this way, the algorithm can explore the objective space more thoroughly and can have more stable performance. Several state-of-the-art many-objective algorithms are adopted as peer algorithms to validate the proposed algorithm. We test the algorithms on two commonly used many-objective problem suites using different numbers of objectives. Numerical results indicate that HEA-DP is highly competitive in most of the problem instances.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0623-6; POD:978-1-5090-0624-3; USB:978-1-5090-0622-9","10.1109/CEC.2016.7743981","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7743981","","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Evolutionary computation;Pareto optimization;Sociology","evolutionary computation;optimisation","HEA-DP;aggregation function;decomposition-based approach;hybrid evolutionary algorithm with dual populations;indicator-based approach;many-objective optimization;reproduction strategy;three-objective problems;two-objective problems","","","","","","","","24-29 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, incentive mechanisms specifically tailored to multimedia crowdsourcing applications need to be developed to fully utilize the potential of multimedia crowdsourcing. In this paper, we design an optimal incentive mechanism for the smartphone contributors to participate in a cloud-enabled multimedia crowdsourcing scheme. We establish a condition that determines whether the smartphones are eligible to participate, and provide a close form expression for the optimal duration of service from the contributors, for a given reward from the crowdsourcer. Consequently, we derive the conditions for existence of an optimal reward for the contributors from the crowdsourcer, and prove its uniqueness. We numerically illustrate the performance of our model considering logarithmic and linear cost functions for the cloud resources. The similarity of the results for different cost models corroborates the validity of our model and the results, whereas the difference in the magnitudes suggests that the strategy of the crowdsourcer as well as the strategies of the smartphone participants considerably depend on the cloud cost model.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2016.2604080","10.13039/501100005416 - Research Council of Norway; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7555338","Crowdsourcing;energy consumption;multimedia cloud;quality of service;reward;utility","Cloud computing;Crowdsourcing;Mobile communication;Multimedia communication;Sensors;Streaming media","Big Data;cloud computing;incentive schemes;multimedia computing;smart phones","big data acquisition;cloud cost model;cloud-enabled multimedia crowdsourcing;emergency rescues;entertainment;environment monitoring;incentive mechanisms;linear cost functions;logarithmic cost functions;natural catastrophes;online education;optimal incentive design;smartphone participants;sports","","","","","","","20160829","Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

By combining a tangent barrier Lyapunov-Krasovskii function with the dynamic surface control technique, the neural network unit in the developed control scheme is able to take its action from the very beginning and play its learning/approximating role safely during the entire system operational envelope, leading to enhanced control performance without the danger of violating compact set precondition. Furthermore, prescribed transient performance and output constraints are strictly ensured in the presence of nonaffine uncertainties, external disturbances, and undetectable actuation faults. The control strategy is also validated by numerical simulation.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2619914","Major State Basic Research Development Program 973; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7738580","Actuation faults;dynamic surface control (DSC);guaranteed transient performance;neuroadaptive control;output constraint.","Control design;Delay effects;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Nonlinear systems;Transient analysis","","","","","","","","","20161108","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

"A Novel Workflow-Level Data Placement Strategy for Data-Sharing Scientific Cloud Workflows","X. Li; L. Zhang; Y. Wu; X. Liu; E. Zhu; H. Yi; F. Wang; C. Zhang; Y. Yang","","IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","","2017","PP","99","1","1","Cloud computing can provide a more cost-effective way to deploy scientific workflows than traditional distributed computing environments such as cluster and grid. Due to the large size of scientific datasets, data placement plays an important role in scientific cloud workflow systems for improving system performance and reducing data transfer cost. Traditional task-level data placement strategy only considers shared datasets within individual workflows to reduce data transfer cost. However, it is obvious that task-level strategy is not necessarily good enough for the situation of multiple workflows at the workflow level. In this paper, a novel workflow-level data placement model is constructed, which regards multiple workflows as a whole. Then, a two-stage data placement strategy is proposed which first pre-allocates initial datasets to proper datacenters during workflow build-time stage, and then dynamically distributes newly generated datasets to appropriate datacenters during runtime stage. Both stages use an efficient discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm to place flexible-location datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our workflow-level data placement strategy can be more cost-effective than its task-level counterpart for data-sharing scientific cloud workflows.","1939-1374;19391374","","10.1109/TSC.2016.2625247","Key Natural Science Foundation of Education Bureau of Anhui Province; 10.13039/501100000923 - Australian Research Council; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7736111","Cloud computing;data placement;data-sharing;particle swarm optimization;scientific workflow","Algorithm design and analysis;Cloud computing;Data models;Data transfer;Distributed databases;Particle swarm optimization;Runtime","","","","","","","","","20161104","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

PERCLOS (the percentage of eye closure) is calculated by using the eye movement data recorded by eye tracking glasses as the indicator of drivers' fatigue level. The prediction correlation coefficient and root mean square error (RMSE) between the estimated fatigue level and the real fatigue level are both used to evaluate the performance of single modality and fusion modality. A comparative study on modality performance is conducted between GELM and support vector machine (SVM). The experimental results show that fusion modality can improve the performance of driving fatigue detection with a higher prediction correlation coefficient and a lower RMSE value in comparison with solely using EEG or forehead EOG. And FLF achieves better performance than DLF. GELM is more suitable for driving fatigue detection than SVM.

With the implementation of cloud DCs (CDCs) and EON virtualization, achieving EON embedding (EONE) is essential, which includes two components: node mapping from the virtual machine to the CDC and link mapping from the virtual lightpath to fiber link(s). In particular, the link mapping must satisfy some rigid constraints in terms of spectrum continuity, consistency, and nonoverlapping, which may create spectrum fragments over fiber links. Thus, in this paper, we reoptimize the virtual concatenation (VCAT) framework accompanied by the hitless push-pull spectrum movement (PPSM) function when the common link mapping fails. Our design framework integrates spectrum movement with inverse multiplexing such that more EONE requests can be satisfied by performing effective spectrum defragmentation. We also optimize the number of subbands with a constrained buffer size to compensate the differential delay at the receiving end. The problem is formulated using the relaxed integer linear programming (ILP) model, and the corresponding heuristic tailored to four different service-sorting strategies is also designed. The simulation results verify the superiority of our method in terms of increasing the spectrum efficiency and reducing the blocking rate of EONE requests. This paper is the first work to focus on designing a reoptimized VCAT framework accompanied by the hitless PPSM function for the EONE that includes both node and link mapping processes rather than a simple spectrum defragmentation.","0733-8724;07338724","","10.1109/JLT.2016.2602340","Foundation of the Education Department of Liaoning Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National High-Level Personnel Special Support Program for Youth Top-Notch Talent; Open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7551126","Buffer-size constraint;elastic optical network embedding;inverse multiplexing optimization;push-pull spectrum movement;virtual concatenation","Cloud computing;Dynamic scheduling;Frequency selective surfaces;Indexes;Optical fiber networks;Radio spectrum management;Substrates","integer programming;linear programming;multiplexing;optical fibre networks;virtual machines","CDC;EON embedding;EON virtualization;EONE;ILP;blocking rate;cloud DC;constrained buffer size;data centers;differential delay;elastic optical network;fiber links;fine-grained slots;high-rate data transmission;hitless PPSM function;hitless push-pull spectrum movement function;inverse multiplexing;link mapping processes;node mapping;orthogonal frequency slots;receiving end;relaxed integer linear programming model;reoptimized VCAT framework;service-sorting strategy;spectrum consistency;spectrum continuity;spectrum defragmentation;spectrum efficiency;spectrum fragments;spectrum nonoverlapping;virtual concatenation framework;virtual lightpath;virtual machine","","","","","","","20160824","Nov.15, 15 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To develop the model, we integrated both the balanced scorecard method and the system dynamics modelling method. Contrasting the traditional university planning tools, the developed model addresses university management problems holistically and dynamically. By integrating the balanced scorecard and system dynamics modelling methods, this study was carried out in three phases. During the first phase, several interviews were conducted, and few documents content were analyzed to formulate the university balanced scorecard. The second phase involved the development of the university planning simulation model. In the third phase, the implications of various different strategies towards university performances were evaluated. Inclusive, a Microworld of the dynamic balanced scorecard for university planning (DBSC-UNI) is constructed to support decision makers in analysing the impact of various different policies towards university performances before real-world implementation. It is found that using system dynamics modelling method, the cause-and-effect relationships among variables related to the four conventional balanced scorecard perspectives are better understand. The dynamic processes that give rise to performance differences between targeted and actual performances also could be better understood. So, it is expected that the quality of the decisions taken are improved because of being better informed. The developed model can be exploited by university management to design policies that can positively influence the future in the direction of desired goals, and will have minimal side effects. This paper integrates balanced scorecard and system dynamics modelling methods in analyzing university performance. Therefore, this paper demonstrates the effectiveness and strength of system dynamics modelling method in solving problem in str- tegic planning area particularly in higher education sector.","","","10.1109/ISMSC.2015.7594080","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7594080","balanced scorecard;simulation;strategic performance;system dynamics;university planning","Computational modeling;Education;Interviews;Mathematical model;Strategic planning;System dynamics","cause-effect analysis;digital simulation;educational institutions;further education;interactive systems;strategic planning","DBSC-UNI;Microworld;cause-and-effect relationships;dynamic balanced scorecard;higher education sector;interactive system dynamics simulation model;strategic planning;strategic university planning process;system dynamics modelling;university balanced scorecard;university management;university performances;university planning simulation model;university planning tools","","","","","","","","19-20 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This makes it possible and necessary to comparatively analyse the different data at a network level. Global network alignment is an important network comparison approach to identify conserved subnetworks and get insight into evolutionary relationship across species. Network alignment which is analogous to subgraph isomorphism is known to be an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel heuristic Particle-Swarm-Optimization based Network Aligner (PSONA), which optimizes a weighted global alignment model considering both protein sequence similarity and interaction conservations. The particle statuses and status updating rules are redefined in a discrete form by using permutation. A seed-and-extend strategy is employed to guide the searching for the superior alignment. The proposed initialization method “seeds” matches with high sequence similarity into the alignment, which guarantees the functional coherence of the mapping nodes. A greedy local search method is designed as the “extension” procedure to iteratively optimize the edge conservations. PSONA is compared with several state-of-art methods on ten network pairs combined by five species. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed aligner can map the proteins with high functional coherence and can be used as a booster to effectively refine the well-studied aligners.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2016.2618380","10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7592892","Particle swarm optimization;biological network alignment;sequence similarity;topological similarity","Coherence;NP-hard problem;Particle swarm optimization;Proteins;Search problems","","","","","","","","","20161019","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The employment of digital puppeteering in addition to agent-based control of virtual characters (avatars) makes this virtual environment potentially helpful in enhancing protective skills meant to reduce risky drinking practices and associated behaviors. The presence of a human-in-the-loop avoids the shortcomings of pure agent-based control, affording an experience in which avatars respond appropriately to both verbal and nonverbal cues in dialogues with a user.

Due to its wide adoption for time-critical applications, such as streaming and real-time signal processing, many acceleration techniques were developed during the past decade. Recently, the graphics processing unit (GPU) has gained much attention for accelerating computationally-intensive problems and many solutions of GPU-based discrete wavelet transform (DWT) have been introduced, but most of them did not fully leverage the potential of the GPU. In this paper, we present various state-of-the-art GPU optimization strategies in DWT implementation, such as leveraging shared memory, registers, warp shuffling instructions, and thread- and instruction-level parallelism (TLP, ILP), and finally elaborate our hybrid approach to further boost up its performance. In addition, we introduce a novel mixed-band memory layout for Haar DWT, where multi-level transform can be carried out in a single fused kernel launch. As a result, unlike recent GPU DWT methods that focus mainly on maximizing ILP, we show that the optimal GPU DWT performance can be achieved by hybrid parallelism combining both TLP and ILP together in a mixed-band approach. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed method by comparison with other CPU and GPU DWT methods.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2016.2536028","Basic Science Research Program; High Performance Big Data Analytics Platform Performance Acceleration Technologies Development); Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion; 10.13039/100007431 - National Research Foundation of Korea; 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; 10.13039/501100003621 - Korea government; 10.13039/501100003662 - R&D program of MOTIE/KEIT; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422119","GPU computing;Wavelet transform;bit rotation;hybrid parallelism;lifting scheme","Acceleration;Discrete wavelet transforms;Graphics processing units;Parallel processing;Registers","discrete wavelet transforms;graphics processing units;optimisation;parallel processing","CPU;GPU DWT methods;GPU optimization strategies;GPU-based discrete wavelet transform;Haar DWT;ILP maximization;acceleration techniques;computationally-intensive problem acceleration;fast discrete wavelet transform;graphics processing unit;hybrid parallelism;mixed-band memory layout;multilevel transform;single fused kernel launch;time-critical applications","","","","","","","20160229","Nov. 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, this paper presents an optimization model for clustering categorical data streams. In the model, a cluster validity function is proposed as the objective function to evaluate the effectiveness of the clustering model while each new input data subset is flowing. It simultaneously considers the certainty of the clustering model and the continuity with the last clustering model in the clustering process. An iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to solve an optimal solution of the objective function with some constraints. Furthermore, we strictly derive a detection index for drifting concepts from the optimization model. We propose a detection method that integrates the detection index and the optimization model to catch the evolution trend of cluster structures on a categorical data stream. The new method can effectively avoid ignoring the effect of the clustering validity on the detection result.

As the most popular mobile OS running on ARM, Android is even more vulnerable to ROP attacks due to its weak implementation of ASLR and the absence of effective control-flow integrity enforcement. In this paper, leveraging specific ARM features, an instruction randomization strategy to mitigate ROP attacks in Android even with the threat of single pointer leakage vulnerabilities is proposed. By popping out more registers in functions' epilogue instructions and reallocating registers in function scopes, branch targets in all (direct and indirect) branch instructions potential to be ROP gadgets are changed randomly. Without the knowledge of binaries' runtime instructions layout, adversary's repeated control flow transfer in ROP exploits will be subverted. Furthermore, this instruction randomization idea has been implemented in both Android Dalvik runtime and ART. Corresponding evaluations proved it is capable to introduce enough randomness for more than 99% discovered functions and thwart about 95% ROP gadgets in application's shared libraries and oat file compiled from Dalvik bytecode. Besides, evaluations on real-world exploits also confirmed its effectiveness on mitigating ROP attacks within acceptable performance overhead.","1673-5447;16735447","","10.1109/CC.2016.7582313","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7582313","ARM architecture;ROP mitigation;instruction randomization;software security","Androids;Humanoid robots;Libraries;Open area test sites;Registers;Runtime;Subspace constraints","Android (operating system);computer crime;mobile computing","ARM-specific in-place instruction randomization;Android Dalvik runtime;Dalvik bytecode;ROP attacks;ROP gadgets;application shared libraries;branch instruction potential;control flow transfer;control-flow integrity enforcement;function epilogue instructions;mobile OS;oat file;operating systems;return-oriented programing attacks;single pointer leakage vulnerabilities","","","","","","","","Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the growing scale of networks has made such a scheduling problem more challenging, as existing set cover and evolutionary algorithms become unable to provide satisfactory efficiency due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, a Kuhn-Munkres (KM) parallel genetic algorithm is developed to solve the set cover problem and is applied to the lifetime maximization of large-scale WSNs. The proposed algorithm schedules the sensors into a number of disjoint complete cover sets and activates them in batch for energy conservation. It uses a divide-and-conquer strategy of dimensionality reduction, and the polynomial KM algorithm a are hence adopted to splice the feasible solutions obtained in each subarea to enhance the search efficiency substantially. To further improve global efficiency, a redundant-trend sensor schedule strategy was developed. Additionally, we meliorate the evaluation function through penalizing incomplete cover sets, which speeds up convergence. Eight types of experiments are conducted on a distributed platform to test and inform the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results show that it offers promising performance in terms of the convergence rate, solution quality, and success rate.","1089-778X;1089778X","","10.1109/TEVC.2015.2511142","10.13039/501100001809 - NSFC Youth Projects; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Key Project; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7362161","Kuhn–Munkres (KM) algorithm;large-scale wireless sensor networks (WSNs);parallel genetic algorithm (PGA);set cover problem","Algorithm design and analysis;Energy consumption;Genetic algorithms;Optimization;Schedules;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","divide and conquer methods;genetic algorithms;polynomials;telecommunication scheduling;wireless sensor networks","Kuhn-Munkres parallel genetic algorithm;WSN;convergence rate;divide-and-conquer strategy;energy conservation;large-scale wireless sensor networks;lifetime maximization;operating mode scheduling;polynomial KM algorithm;set cover problem;solution quality;success rate","","2","","","","","20151222","Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For the purpose of comparison, we consider the direct jamming strategy and the adaptive jamming strategy as benchmark schemes. Closed-form expressions of the exact intercept probability for three jamming strategies are derived over Rayleigh fading channels and the theoretical analysis is validated by Monte-Carlo simulation. Both the analytical and the simulation results show that: 1) increasing the power of jammer is an effective approach to mitigate the intercept probability; 2) the intercept probability can be decreased and the wiretapped range of eavesdropper can be reduced by increasing the number of jammer; 3) by using perfect CSI and selecting optimal jammer, cautious jamming strategy outperforms direct jamming strategy and adaptive jamming strategy.","","","10.1109/IWCMC.2016.7577145","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7577145","intercept probability;jamming strategy;optimal jammer selection;physical-layer security","Closed-form solutions;Interference;Jamming;Receivers;Security;Wireless networks","Gaussian noise;Monte Carlo methods;Rayleigh channels;jamming;probability;radio receivers;telecommunication security","Gaussian noise;Monte-Carlo simulation;Rayleigh fading channels;adaptive jamming strategy;cautious jamming strategy;closed-form expressions;direct jamming strategy;eavesdropper;intercept probability;optimal jammer selection method;perfect CSI;perfect channel state information;physical-layer security;wireless communication;wireless networks;wiretapped range","","","","","","","","5-9 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To reach that goal, the simulation makes use of current virtual reality devices (specifically the Oculus Rift DK2) to increase the level of immersion for the user. The focus of our research lies on the design and simulation of the foraging strategies of two antagonistic ant species, as well as the creation of an accessible experimentation environment. In particular, an invasive species based on the Argentine Ant (Lipethima Humile) is introduced into an ecosystem already populated by a native species modelled along the Black Garden Ant (Lasius Niger). The user can then use virtual tools inspired by real-life means to control the spreading of ants and help the native species to survive despite being inferior to the invasive ant. Options include manipulating pheromones used by the ants for navigation and, thereby, influencing the mechanism of mutual identification, or placing obstacles that block the ants' path. Also, many key parameters that control the ants can be modified during runtime. An integrated logging mechanism allows to collect data which can be processed by standard tools. The simulation also offers a dynamic, nature-inspired interactive example of the Ant Colony Optimization principle and can help to make natural processes more accessible.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2344-8; POD:978-1-5090-2345-5","10.1109/KELVAR.2016.7563675","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7563675","Ant Algorithms;Education;Optimision;Sandbox;Self-Organisation;Virtual Reality","Ecosystems;Games;Navigation;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Virtual reality;Visualization","ant colony optimisation;biology computing;computer games;digital simulation;virtual reality;zoology","Argentine ant;Black Garden ant;Lasius Niger ant;Lipethima Humile ant;Neozoa;Oculus Rift DK2;ant colony optimization principle;antagonistic ant species foraging strategies;competing ant species;immersive sandbox;integrated logging mechanism;interactive sandbox;interactive simulation game;invasive ant species;virtual reality devices","","","","","","","","19-19 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In October 2012, the European Union adopted the Energy Efficiency Directive with the aim to reduce the primary energy consumption by 20% by 2020. One key point in the reduction of energy consumption energy is the awareness of final users about their usage of energy. At the same time, policies aimed at improving the efficiency of energy use, are a keystone in the strategies of leading Distribution System Operators (DSOs) and energy retail companies that started to offer, in addition to the energy supply, services and suggestions concerning the energy management in the daily family life. The first step toward a better use of energy is the awareness and the monitoring of the consumption. Since not all the final users have a professional education concerning energy, the figure of energy consumption are not enough to transfer the information. In order to support the final users to improve their energy behavior, additional information, comments, comparison (with similar users and with past consumption) have to be supplied with proper channel. The smart meters at the final users must be able to communicate with the users themselves or have to be connected to a storage and computation unit, in order to give a feedback, useful to evaluate and improved the final users' behaviors.

Then, we assign the transitional saliency scores by warping the support set annotations onto the input image according to computed dense correspondences. To incorporate context, we employ two complementary correspondence strategies: a global matching scheme based on scene-level analysis and a local matching scheme based on patch-level inference. We then introduce two refinement measures to further refine the saliency maps and apply the random-walk-with-restart by exploring the global saliency structure to estimate the affinity between foreground and background assignments.

Here, a general framework is presented to analyze the tradeoff among these three performance metrics in cooperative OFDMA systems with decode-and-forward relaying, where subcarrier pairing and allocation, relay selection, choice of transmission strategy, and power allocation are jointly considered. In our analytical framework, rate fairness is represented utilizing the α-fairness model, and the resource allocation problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. We then propose a cross-layer resource allocation algorithm across application and physical layers, and further devise a heuristic algorithm to tackle the computational complexity issue. The SE-EE tradeoff is characterized as a Pareto optimal set, and the efficiency and fairness tradeoff is investigated through the price of fairness. Simulations indicate that higher fairness results in a worse SE-EE tradeoff. It is also shown imposing fairness helps to reduce the outage probability. For a fixed number of relays, by increasing circuit power, the performance of SE-EE tradeoff is degraded. Interestingly, by increasing the number of relays, although the total circuit power is increased, the SE-EE tradeoff is not necessarily degraded. This is thanks to the extra degree of freedom provided in relay selection.","1536-1276;15361276","","10.1109/TWC.2016.2583421","Beijing Municipal Education Commission through the University Science Park Programme; European Union Seventh Framework Programme; U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7496967","Cross-layer optimization;OFDMA;cooperative communications;energy efficiency;price of fairness;rate fairness;resource allocation;spectral efficiency","Bandwidth;Decoding;Heuristic algorithms;Optimization;Relays;Resource management;Wireless communication","OFDM modulation;Pareto analysis;Pareto optimisation;cooperative communication;decode and forward communication;energy conservation;frequency division multiple access;relay networks (telecommunication);resource allocation;telecommunication power management","α-fairness model;Pareto optimal set;SE-EE tradeoff;computational complexity issue;cross-layer resource allocation algorithm;decode-and-forward relaying;degree of freedom;energy efficiency;heuristic algorithm;multiobjective optimization problem;outage probability reduction;power allocation;rate fairness tradeoff;relay selection;relay-aided cooperative OFDMA system;resource constrained wireless system;spectral efficiency;subcarrier allocation;subcarrier pairing;transmission strategy","","","","","","","20160621","Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Simulation results based on ndnSIM show that the proposed mechanism can dramatically reduce repeated downloading, promote cooperation among vehicles with less delay and overhead, under the premise of obtaining integrated target content.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9955-5; POD:978-1-4673-9956-2","10.1109/INFCOMW.2016.7562078","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7562078","","Ad hoc networks;Game theory;Heterogeneous networks;Internet;Logic gates;Vehicles;Wireless communication","Long Term Evolution;cooperative communication;game theory;peer-to-peer computing;transport protocols;vehicular ad hoc networks","Internet;LTE;TCP/IP architecture;VANET;content distribution;cooperative downloading;game theory;gateway selection;heterogeneous network;named data networking;peer-to-peer content downloading protocols;prior-response-incentive-mechanism;roadside infrastructures;vehicle-to-vehicle communications","","1","","","","","","10-14 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the first phase of CUDAlign 4.0, a huge Dynamic Programming (DP) matrix is computed by multiple GPUs, which asynchronously communicate border elements to the right neighbor in order to find the optimal score. After that, the traceback phase of SW is executed. The efficient parallelization of the traceback phase is very challenging because of the high amount of data dependency, which particularly impacts the performance and limits the application scalability. In order to obtain a multi-GPU highly parallel traceback phase, we propose and evaluate a new parallel traceback algorithm called Incremental Speculative Traceback (IST), which pipelines the traceback phase, speculating incrementally over the values calculated so far, producing results in advance. With CUDAlign 4.0, we were able to calculate SW matrices with up to 60 Peta cells, obtaining the optimal local alignments of all Human and Chimpanzee homologous chromosomes, whose sizes range from 26 Millions of Base Pairs (MBP) up to 249 MBP.

In order to evaluate students' learning achievement, self-efficacy and learning behavior patterns when using this approach, an experiment was conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

An intuitive model of a service market is a reverse auction. In the first price auction, however, a service that is cheaper and provides better quality is not necessarily selected. This causes undesirable outcomes both for users and service providers. A possible solution is the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, where the dominant strategy for a service provider is to report the true cost of his service. In spite of this desirable property, implementing the VCG mechanism for service composition suffers from computational cost. The calculation of payments to service providers based on the VCG mechanism requires iterative service selection, even though each service selection can be NP-hard. Approximation algorithms cannot be applied because approximate solutions do not assure the desirable property of the VCG mechanism. Thus, we model VCG payments for service markets and propose a dynamic programming (DP)-based algorithm for service selection and VCG payment calculation. Our proposed algorithm solves service selection in quasi-polynomial time and gives an exact solution. Moreover, we extend it and focus on the iterative service selection process for VCG payment calculation to improve its performance. Our series of experiments show that our proposed algorithm solves practical scale service composition.","2168-7161;21687161","","10.1109/TCC.2014.2338310","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6853351","Service composition;VCG mechanism;dynamic programming;service selection","Abstracts;Cloud computing;Computational complexity;Computational modeling;Concrete;Licenses;Software as a service","cloud computing;computational complexity;dynamic programming;pricing","VCG payments;Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism;cloud service composition;dynamic programming;iterative service selection process;quasipolynomial time;service markets;strategy-proof pricing","","1","","","","OAPA","20140711","July-Sept. 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the densely deployment of RRHs in H-CRAN leads to downlink/uplink traffic asymmetry and severe inter-cell interference which could seriously impair the network throughput and resource utilization. To simultaneously solve these two problems, we proposed a dynamic resource allocation (DRA) scheme for H-CRAN in TDD mode.

Our results can be easily extended to other wireless mice using different radio links. We begin by presenting multiple ways to sniff unencrypted Bluetooth packets containing raw mouse movement data. We then show that such data may reveal text-based passwords entered by clicking on software keyboards. We propose two attacks, the prediction attack and replay attack, which can reconstruct the on-screen cursor trajectories from sniffed mouse movement data.

Our work consists mainly of three parts. The first part focuses on the analysis of CVD's mathematical properties. We characterize CVD's central tendency as the mirror-image distribution and provide mathematical formula for its probability density function. We also provide a closed formula for the relationship between CVD's vertices, chords, and faces, the average chord length, and the average edge number of a CVD polygon. And, the expressions for the average overall and local positioning error are also provided. Based upon these findings, we show that the convergence speed for a CVD based localization scheme is quadratic, and the optimal time and space complexities are Θ(n<sup>2</sup>) and Θ(n), respectively. The second part proposes a novel approach, called Polling, which utilizes the concept of the Error Region, to further improve the accuracy. Polling, in theory, enables us to make use of the topology information with the quantity up to O(n<sup>4</sup>) provided by CVD for localization, while a conventional CVD scheme can use only O(1) such information. The third part, through simulations, shows how to use the quasi Analog-to-Digital Conversion (qADC) strategy to handle signal errors. Combined with Polling and qADC, a CVD scheme can provide a simple, robust, and powerful solution to the wireless network localization.

Although dozens of resource allocation heuristics have been developed to improve the QoS of Cloud workflow, it is hard to predict their performance under variations because of the lack of accurate modeling and evaluation methods. So far, there is no comprehensive approach that can quantitatively reason the capability of resource allocation strategies or enable the tuning of parameters to optimize resource allocation solutions under variations. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a novel framework that can evaluate and optimize resource allocation strategies effectively and quantitatively. By using the statistical model checker UPPAAL-SMC and supervised learning approaches, our framework can: i) conduct complex QoS queries on resource allocation instances considering resource variations; ii) make quantitative and qualitative comparisons among resource allocation strategies; iii) enable the tuning of parameters to improve the overall QoS; and iv) support the quick optimization of overall workflow QoS under customer requirements and resource variations.

The task is performed on the real system with the aid of Computer-Aided Design freeware. The combination of practice and software tools encourages the development of autonomous learning and favours the apprehension of the concepts of uncertainty and robustness. A perception survey shows promising results indicating that the strategy of learning by doing is very well accepted by the students.","1932-8540;19328540","","10.1109/RITA.2016.2553978","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7452574","Action Learning;Action learning;Computer Aided Instruction;Control Engineering Education;Freeware Tools;QFT;computer aided instruction;control engineering education;freeware tools","Design automation;Feedback control;Mathematical model;Robustness;Software tools;Solid modeling;Uncertainty","CAD;computer aided instruction;control engineering computing;control engineering education;educational courses;feedback;robust control;software tools","CAD;autonomous learning;computer-aided design freeware;educational experience;feedback control;hands-on experience;initial course;mechanical system;robust control concepts;robust design;software tools","","","","27","","","20160414","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We formalize this problem as mining top-k group relationships (GRs), which captures strong social ties between groups of actors. While existing works focus on patterns that follow from the well known homophily principle, we are interested in social ties that do not follow from homophily, thus, provide new insights. Finding top-k GRs faces new challenges: it requires a novel ranking metric because traditional metrics favor patterns that are expected from the homophily principle; it requires an innovative search strategy since there is no obvious anti-monotonicity for such GRs; it requires a novel data structure to avoid data explosion caused by multidimensional nodes and edges and many-to-many relationships in a social network. We address these issues through presenting an efficient algorithm, GRMiner, for mining top-k GRs and we evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency using real data.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2020-1","10.1109/ICDE.2016.7498259","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7498259","","Data mining;Education;Facebook;Image edge detection;Measurement;Search problems","","","","1","","30","","","","16-20 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to such significance, research into the two-tier tests had mushroomed but few studies examined why the two-tier test approach was effective. To this end, we conducted an empirical study, where a lag sequential analysis was used to analyze behavior patterns while qualitative data from the questionnaire were applied to explain why these behavior patterns were happened. The results indicated students with a two-tier test tended to realize the rationale of a concept, instead of relying on their memories. In other words, the two-tier test can facilitate students to develop deep thinking skills. This may be because they considered the two-tier test as a learning tool, instead of an assessment tool only.","1939-1382;19391382","","10.1109/TLT.2015.2510003","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7360189","Lag sequential analysis;Two-tier test;higher education;learning behavior analysis;online assessment","Calculus;Education;Instruments;Learning systems;Reliability;Sequential analysis;Statistical analysis","Internet;calculus;computer aided instruction;educational courses;mathematics computing","assessment tool;behavior patterns;deep thinking skills;higher education;learning activity;online tests;two-tier test strategy;university calculus course","","","","43","","","20151217","April-June 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

So a corresponding method is proposed to prejudge the reconstructed object volume rapidly, and relative parameters are calculated by considering both the definition of the rectangular bounding box and the projection relationship in cone-beam CT scan. Then the computational redundancy is reduced greatly. For its implementation in cone-beam CT, the parallel computing capability of the multi-core CPUs is fully performed by combination of two strategies, adaptive CPU cores allocation and reconstructed volume partition, based on the estimation of computation task. The experiment results show that the proposed method has good adaptability and significantly higher speed compared with Z-line data priority reconstruction.

As a result, engineers and manufacturing enterprises require new human and organisational competencies together with state-of-the-art collaboration tools to support competitive concurrent strategies as part of their daily work and business operation.

This strategy not only increases the opportunity of data sharing among vehicles but also gives higher probability of packet decoding, which in turn enhances the data service performance.

Additionally maintaining, storing and using the physical hardware presents many practical problems for teachers. These factors combine to create a significant entry barrier, especially for teachers who have previously not used robots and may be lacking confidence or motivation to use physical computing as a teaching aid. Robotic simulation provides a good alternative as it provides the experience and many of the benefits of working with robots to be gained at low cost, using computers already available in school. A software platform which meets this need is CoSpace Rescue. This has been created by Singapore Polytechnic as an educational tool and provides a simulation platform for RoboCupJunior. This platform allows students to experience event driven programming by developing search strategies to find and deposit coloured objects, whilst avoiding obstacles and traps. CoSpace was introduced to the UK in 2013 coincident with the introduction of a new compulsory national computing curriculum for England. The approach used to introduce CoSpace into schools and the relevance that CoSpace has to the new curriculum for England are presented in this paper.

Thus, strengthening the study skills of the students plays a key role in reducing this dropout rate and should be a key objective of every education system. In particular, universities have the power to improve the study skills of pupils at an early stage through the designed programs and measures. With the Pupils' Academy Serious Gaming, the Department of Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) has introduced an instrument to promote the study skills. This initiative aimed primarily at pupils of upper vocational schools (UVS). In addition to the study skills, thus the ability of more application-oriented knowledge transfer objectives and playful introduction to an important enterprise software can be achieved. This paper presents the Pupils' Academy based on the online SAP ERP Simulation Game ERPsim as an example of how the enterprise software SAP ERP is successfully applied to strengthen study skills. In addition, the pupils learn how to deal with the SAP platform and train skills like decision making, analysis, strategy development, data processing and presentation. The positive impact on study skills is evidenced with the help of a self-assessment by means of an IT-based survey carried out by the participating students. These examinations include the activities related to the two study skills time management and teamwork.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8633-3; POD:978-1-4673-8634-0","10.1109/EDUCON.2016.7474611","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7474611","ERPsim;IT-based questionnaire;didactic framework;online business game;study skills;vocational school","Companies;Education;Games;Laboratories;Software;Teamwork","computer aided instruction;educational institutions;serious games (computing)","ERPsim;TUM;Technical University of Munich;UVS;decision making;dropout rate;education system;enterprise software SAP ERP;knowledge transfer objectives;planning skills;pupil academy serious gaming;pupils academy;upper vocational schools","","1","","31","","","","10-13 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, matrix factorization has achieved great success in cross-modal hashing. However, how to effectively use label information and local geometric structure is still a challenging problem for these approaches. To address this issue, we propose a cross-modal hashing method based on collective matrix factorization, which considers both the label consistency across different modalities and the local geometric consistency in each modality. These two elements are formulated as a graph Laplacian term in the objective function, leading to a substantial improvement on the discriminative power of latent semantic features obtained by collective matrix factorization. Moreover, the proposed method learns unified hash codes for different modalities of an instance to facilitate cross-modal search, and the objective function is solved using an iterative strategy. The experimental results on two benchmark data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2016.2564638","Key Projects of Outstanding Youth Talent Support Program of Anhui Provincial Universities; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100003995 - Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7466099","Cross-modal hashing;collective matrix factorization;cross-modal hashing;label consistency;local geometric consistency;multimedia retrieval","Image coding;Laplace equations;Linear programming;Manifolds;Multimedia communication;Semantics;Sparse matrices","computational complexity;geometry;graph theory;information retrieval;matrix decomposition","collective matrix factorization;cross-modal hashing;cross-modal retrieval;graph Laplacian;heterogeneous multimedia data;iterative strategy;label information;local geometric structure;low-dimensional Hamming space;supervised matrix factorization hashing","","4","","49","","","20160506","July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Task scheduling for precedence-constrained parallel applications represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in HMCSs is an NP-HARD problem. Over the last three decades, several task scheduling techniques have been developed for energy-aware scheduling. However, it is impossible for a single task scheduling technique to outperform all other techniques for all types of applications and situations. Motivated by these observations, hyperheuristic framework is introduced. Moreover, a quantum-inspired high-level learning strategy is proposed to improve the performance of this framework. Meanwhile, a fast solution evaluation technique is designed to reduce the computational burden for each iteration step. Experimental results show that the fast solution evaluation technique can improve average algorithm search speed by 38 percent and that the proposed algorithm generally exhibits outstanding convergence performance.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2015.2462835","National High Technology Research and Development Program of China; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province; Special Project on the Integration of Industry, Education and Research of Guangdong Province; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7173041","Power and performance tradeoff optimization;energy-aware scheduling;heterogeneous multiprocessor or multicomputer systems;hyper-heuristics;power and performance tradeoff optimization;precedence-constrained parallel application;quantum;quantum computing","Energy consumption;Heuristic algorithms;Optimization;Processor scheduling;Program processors;Schedules;Scheduling","computational complexity;directed graphs;multiprocessing systems;power aware computing;quantum computing;scheduling","DAG;HMCS;NP-hard problem;directed acyclic graph;dynamically variable voltage;energy-aware scheduling;energy-constrained performance optimization;fast solution evaluation technique;heterogeneous computing systems;heterogeneous multicomputer systems;heterogeneous multiprocessor systems;performance-constrained energy optimization;power-performance tradeoff optimization;precedence-constrained parallel applications;quantum-inspired high-level learning strategy;quantum-inspired hyper-heuristics;task scheduling","","1","","51","","","20150730","June 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Pedagogical strategies in fields with an abundance of abstract concepts, such as physics or electrical engineering, additionally recommend experiential experience, such as laboratory experiments, as essential learning tools. To fulfill increased demand for engineers, additional educational opportunities have been created, which include online, remote and blended learning environments. Unfortunately, providing hands-on experience in these environments, which is as effective as in-class experiments in STEM fields, is extremely challenging. Different departments have developed online and remote solutions, from single remote introductory courses with online experiments to entire off-campus programs supported by remotely conducted experiments with mobile studios. However, in online situations, students often feel lost, have issues with the technology, and experience lack of engagement. All these factors can result in increased dropout rates or lack of understanding and commitment. Current trends in online education incline towards engaging students using gamification strategies to reduce dropout rates and to increase students' motivation in a playful way. Additionally, creating playful experiences for students can be used to attract novice students to this field. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework, which can be used to enhance online and mobile experiments with game design strategies to raise students' engagement and commitment and reduce initial onboarding obstacles.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7717-1; POD:978-1-4673-7718-8; USB:978-1-4673-7716-4","10.1109/EXPAT.2015.7463270","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7463270","game-based learning;gamification;mobile experimentation;mobile labs;online learning;remote learning","Computational modeling;Computers;Context;Games;Learning management systems;Mobile communication","Internet;STEM;computer aided instruction;computer games;educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;mobile computing;teaching","STEM education;gamification strategy;mobile experimentation;off-campus program;online education;online experimentation;pedagogical strategy;remote introductory course;science technology engineering and mathematics;teaching","","1","","28","","","","2-4 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through rigorous analysis, we prove that the optimal BESS control is a “state-invariant” strategy in the sense that the optimal SoC range does not vary with the state of the system. As such, the optimal control strategy can be computed offline once and for all with very low complexity. Regarding the BESS planning, we prove that the the minimum operating cost is a decreasing convex function of the BESS energy capacity. This leads to the optimal BESS sizing that strikes a balance between the capital investment and operating cost.

A game theoretic approach is proposed to address the relevant trade-off between the encounter probability and the energy consumption due to mobility. A non-cooperative, two-strategy, symmetric game is formulated to regulate mobility in energy constrained DTNs. The relevant N-player game gives rise to the proposed autonomic scheme that modifies traditional Poisson-based mobility models toward regulating nodes mobility in synchronized self-organizing DTNs aiming at efficiently employing the nodes residual energy resources. The DTN operation is organized in cycles and is composed of two phases. At the beginning of every cycle, the DTN nodes determine the energy cost due to mobility and, accordingly, engage either in the standard or in the game phase, during which the nodes probabilistically decide either to move following the mobility model adopted or to stay static. Both decisions are related to payoffs expressed in terms of the energy cost and the encounter probability. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme manages the relevant trade-off toward significantly prolonging the lifetime of DTNs amenable to encounter probability reduction.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2015.2462951","Education and Lifelong Learning; European Union; National Strategic Reference Framework; Research Funding Program: Heracleitus II; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7181719","Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs);Delay tolerant networks (DTNs);Poisson mobility models;Wireless Self-Organizing Networks (WSONs);controlled mobility;encounter probability;energy constrained DTNs;game theory;poisson mobility models;wireless self-organizing networks (WSONs)","Energy consumption;Games;Mobile nodes;Sensors;Synchronization;Wireless communication","delay tolerant networks;energy consumption;game theory;mobility management (mobile radio);probability;stochastic processes;telecommunication power management","DTN nodes;DTN operation;N-player game;Poisson-based mobility models;autonomic scheme;delay tolerant networks;encounter probability reduction;energy consumption;energy cost;game theory;mobility management;node mobility;node residual energy resources;noncooperative two-strategy symmetric game;self-organizing DTN","","0","","52","","","20150806","June 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the proposed approach, wavelet packet decomposition was firstly used to smooth EOG signals during reading tasks, and then, according to the predefined coding strategy, the smoothed EOG waveform is translated into a coding string to represent current reading state. Finally, Levenshtein distance is employed to measure the similarity of the template string and the output string. The experiments under the experimental paradigms of autonomy-reading and stimulus-reading and reading with rest state have been carried out. The mean accurate has reached 90%.

This study has two parts. In the first part, we selected a sample of countries covering all levels of human development index (HDI) and found an inverse correlation between HDI and population growth. We also found that countries with low and medium HDI have low education indexes and need to improve their primary education completion rates, secondary education enrollment, and tertiary education enrollment. In the second part, we performed a SWOT analysis to identify the internal and external factors of MOOCs that influence their ability to be used for e-Education in countries with low and medium human development.

However, how to accurately estimate the delay in an online-implementation manner is still an open and challenging problem. In this study, we study the data-driven delay estimation in a practical cloud media with heavy traffic, and propose an accurate estimation strategy only with a small amount of dataset. Importantly, we explicitly model the subjective announcement-dependent user response via an objective response function through the elaborate data analysis and model.

Popular files are stored in local caches of SBSs, so that a user can download the desired files from one of the SBSs in its vicinity. The offloading-loss is captured via a cost function that depends on the random caching strategy proposed here. The popularity profile of cached content is unknown and estimated using instantaneous demands from users within a specified time interval. An estimate of the cost function is obtained from which an optimal random caching strategy is devised. The training time to achieve an ∈ > 0 difference between the achieved and optimal costs is finite provided the user density is greater than a predefined threshold, and scales as N<sup>2</sup>, where N is the support of the popularity profile. A transfer learning-based approach to improve this estimate is proposed.

Using a simple but realistic set of assumptions, we propose a general model for software testing and define sampling strategies for random (R) and systematic (S<sub>0</sub>) testing, where each sampling is associated with a sampling cost: 1 and c units of time, respectively. The two most important goals of software testing are: (i) achieving in minimal time a given degree of confidence x in a program's correctness and (ii) discovering a maximal number of errors within a given time bound n̂. For both (i) and (ii), we show that there exists a bound on c beyond which R performs better than S<sub>0</sub> on the average. Moreover for (i), this bound depends asymptotically only on x. We also show that the efficiency of R can be fitted to the exponential curve. Using these results we design a hybrid strategy H that starts with R and switches to S<sub>0</sub> when S<sub>0</sub> is expected to discover more errors per unit time. In our experiments we find that H performs similarly or better than the most efficient of both and that S<sub>0</sub> may need to be significantly faster than our bounds suggest to retain efficiency over R.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2015.2487274","SPECMATE; 10.13039/501100000781 - ERC; 10.13039/501100001459 - Singapore's Ministry of Education; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7289448","Efficient Testing;Error-based Partitioning;Partition Testing;Partition testing;Random Testing;Testing Theory;efficient testing;error-based partitioning;random testing;testing theory","Color;Input variables;Random variables;Software engineering;Software testing;Systematics","probability;program testing","automated software testing;exponential curve;hybrid strategy;probabilistic analysis;random testing;sampling strategies;systematic testing","","","","37","","","20151005","April 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Conventional DFT-based channel estimation methods encounter performance degradation due to low SNR and the edge effect caused by virtual subcarriers. Adding virtual carrier frequency responses (VCFR) properly at receivers is proved to be able to effectively mitigate edge effect. The proposed method adopts the VCFR addition method into practical downlink LTE systems to alleviate edge effect. A novel noise eliminating strategy based on energy detection is demonstrated in the proposed method to improve the overall performance especially in low SNR scenario. Compared with existing DFT-based channel estimation methods, simulation results of the proposed channel estimation method showed a relatively lower Mean Square Error (MSE) and raw Bit Error Rate (BER) under several kinds of standard channel models with wide SNR range.

The main reason is the services and sources provided the users by the clouds. In order to avoid over interactions of the servers and given the work volume and green computations, load balancing in cloud computing is of enormous importance requiring dynamic load distribution in a proportionate manner among the servers. Load balancing may reduce the used energy through avoiding over interaction between the nodes and virtual machines providing desired resource utilization. When a system fails, high costs are imposed on both server and customer, thus load balancing algorithm needs good fault tolerance. There are various techniques to increase fault tolerance. In this study task replication technique was used. To do so three fuzzy inference engines with an approach to fault tolerance for tasks prioritization, virtual prioritization and virtual machines as a goal for task replication were designed. Fuzzy method was selected because the question environment is uncertain and the parameters determination which is carried out by fuzzy method. In the proposed procedure by tasks and virtual priority, we could provide a proper work load distribution. The aim of this study was to present a novel strategy to improve load balancing for increasing fault tolerance and reducing energy consumption via ranking the tasks and virtual machines in cloud computing by fuzzy method.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6506-2; POD:978-1-4673-6507-9","10.1109/KBEI.2015.7436178","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7436178","Cloud computing;Energy consumption;Fuzzy method;fault tolerance;load balancing","Decision support systems;Engines;Fuzzy logic;Handheld computers;Pragmatics;Reliability;Virtual machining","cloud computing;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;resource allocation;software fault tolerance","cloud computing;dynamic load distribution;energy consumption;fault tolerance;fuzzy inference engines;fuzzy method;load balancing algorithm;task replication technique;tasks prioritization;virtual machines;virtual prioritization","","1","","22","","","","5-6 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a systematic approach to address the soft-error problem in multiprocessor system-on-chip with the consideration of system performance optimization. To guarantee the system correctness, a hardware-software collaborated approach is proposed to protect the processors from soft errors. Tiny hardware sensors are embedded in the processor cores to detect the soft errors, and the software-based rollback scheduling mechanisms are applied for error recovery. The protection costs on hardware duplication and software redundancy are effectively reduced. To optimize the system performance, a distributed control system is built on top of the on-chip communication network and collaboratively manages the entire chip for application execution. With the cluster-based task migration techniques, an efficient runtime task remapping and rescheduling algorithm is proposed to further mitigate the overheads induced by soft-error protection and to minimize the total performance degradation. The distributed control strategy makes the system more adaptable and flexible to the development of the next-generation hardware and software with larger scales. Extensive performance evaluations using SystemC-based cycle-accurate simulations on a set of real-world applications show that our approach has on average 49% performance improvement and 79.6% energy consumption reduction compared with the related state-of-the-art techniques, and hardware synthesis results show that our approach only introduces 2.9% chip area overheads.","1063-8210;10638210","","10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2452910","Chongqing High-Tech Research Program; Hong Kong Special Administrative Region; National 863 Programs; Public Sector Research Funding through the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7202910","Algorithm;distributed control;multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC);network-on-chip (NoC);performance;soft-error;task migration;task migration.","Decentralized control;Hardware;Optimization;Processor scheduling;Program processors;Scheduling","distributed sensors;embedded systems;hardware-software codesign;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability;network-on-chip;radiation hardening (electronics)","SystemC based cycle accurate simulations;cluster based task migration technique;distributed control strategy;distributed sensor network-on-chip;error recovery;hardware duplication;on-chip communication network;performance optimization;runtime task remapping;runtime task rescheduling;soft error detection;soft-error tolerant multiprocessor system-on-chip;software based rollback scheduling;software redundancy","","0","","35","","","20150814","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the existing approaches usually rely on carefully designed regularizers and handcrafted parameter tuning to obtain satisfactory estimation of the blur kernel. Many regularizers exhibit the structure-preserving smoothing capability, but fail to enhance salient edges. In this paper, under the MAP framework, we propose the iteration-wise ℓ<sub>p</sub>-norm regularizers together with data-driven strategy to address these issues. First, we extend the generalized shrinkage-thresholding (GST) operator for ℓ<sub>p</sub>-norm minimization with negative p value, which can sharpen salient edges while suppressing trivial details. Then, the iteration-wise GST parameters are specified to allow dynamical salient edge selection and time-varying regularization. Finally, instead of handcrafted tuning, a principled discriminative learning approach is proposed to learn the iterationwise GST operators from the training dataset. Furthermore, the multi-scale scheme is developed to improve the efficiency of the algorithm. Experimental results show that, negative p value is more effective in estimating the coarse shape of blur kernel at the early stage, and the learned GST operators can be well generalized to other dataset and real world blurry images. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves better deblurring results in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality, and it is much faster than the state-of-the-art patch-based blind deconvolution method.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2016.2531905","Hong Kong Research Grants Council General Research Fund; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100004602 - Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University within the Ministry of Education; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7412703","Blind deconvolution;blind deconvolution;discriminative learning;hyper-Laplacian;image deblurring;kernel estimation","Deconvolution;Estimation;Kernel;Minimization;Smoothing methods;Training;Tuning","image segmentation;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);maximum likelihood estimation","ℓ<sub>p</sub>-norm minimization;GST operator;MAP;blind deconvolution;blur kernel;dynamical salient edge selection;handcrafted parameter tuning;learning iteration wise generalized shrinkage thresholding operators;maximum a posteriori;quantitative metrics;salient edge selection;structure-preserving smoothing capability;time varying regularization;time-varying regularization;visual quality","","","","53","","","20160218","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

None of them has taken into consideration the incompleteness of the educational data gathered in an academic credit system. If just a few records have missing values, we might ignore them in the mining task. However, as there are a large number of missing values, ignoring them may lead to the data insufficiency and ineffectiveness of the mining task. On the other hand, many research works have recently proposed several general-purpose solutions to incomplete data clustering. The main difficulties with these solutions for reuse are how to appropriately determine a pre-specified number of the clusters for each data set in a particular application domain and the non-arbitrary shapes of the resulting clusters. Hence, we focus on two parts: the first one that resolves the incomplete data clustering task in the education domain and the second one that proposes a robust effective approach to the aforementioned clustering task. Our resulting solution to clustering incomplete educational data is a mean shift-based clustering algorithm named iMS_nps using the nearest prototype strategy. iMS_nps can also overcome the aforementioned difficulties. In addition, experimental results have shown that the clusters from our proposed algorithm have better cluster quality as compared to some existing approaches.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8234-2; POD:978-1-4673-8235-9","10.1109/ACOMP.2015.14","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422369","educational data mining;incomplete data clustering;nearest prototype;parameter-free data clustering;robustness","Cities and towns;Clustering algorithms;Data handling;Data mining;Prototypes;Robustness;Shape","data mining;educational administrative data processing;pattern clustering","academic credit system;educational data mining arena;general-purpose solutions;iMS_nps;incomplete educational data clustering;nearest prototype strategy;robust mean shift-based approach","","","","26","","","","23-25 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The broad public interest in the Middle Ages is still continuing, including all aspects of medieval life and culture, in media and as events on historical sites. Also the gaming community has a strong affinity towards medieval contents which is clearly visible in numerous popular titles and an ever-growing market. There is probably a substantial overlap between those two communities. Our approach envisions a serious game for both communities, to provide education on historical construction techniques and foster motivation for preservation of built heritage. Thereby we put a focus on the conceptual game design based on historical research and a reference to a heritage site. The implementation was done as a proof of concept. The idea has been realized with the listed heritage castle Waldenfels in Upper Austria. The context of the game is set by the medieval building phase of the castle which is only partially preserved. Its content focuses on medieval professions in construction, including their tools, materials and methods. The game's target audience are local people, tourists with an interest in castles, architecture students, as well as craftsmen and conservators. The benefit of using contemporary communication strategies like serious games for traditional construction techniques lies in the vitalisation of intangible heritage for an interested audience. Thus, the game aims to motivate and educate its audience to participate in preserving local tangible heritage as a community effort. We see our approach as a contribution to a sustainable living heritage that is supported by an involved community.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0048-7; POD:978-1-5090-0049-4; USB:978-1-5090-0047-0","10.1109/DigitalHeritage.2015.7419504","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7419504","architectural heritage;castle Waldenfels;historical construction work;intangible heritage;living heritage;serious games","Games;History;Mortar;Rocks;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays","buildings (structures);computer aided instruction;history;serious games (computing);structural engineering computing","Europe;Upper Austria;built heritage preservation;conceptual game design;heritage Waldenfels castle;heritage site;historical construction technique education;historical research;intangible heritage vitalisation;local tangible heritage preservation;medieval building phase;medieval contents;medieval professions;serious game;sustainable living heritage","","","","26","","","","Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, growing efforts have been devoted to protecting the privacy of individuals while data aggregation is performed, which is a critical operation in behavior analysis. Unfortunately, existing methods allow very limited aggregation over user data, such as allowing only summation, which hardly satisfies the need of behavior analysis. In this paper, we propose a scheme PPSA, which encrypts users' sensitive data to prevent privacy leakage from both analysts and the aggregation service provider, and fully supports selective aggregate functions for differentially private data analysis. We have implemented our design and evaluated its performance using a trace-driven evaluation based on an online behavior dataset.

This question is relevant in physics for the study of correlations and plays an important role in computer science in the context of complexity and cryptography. In this paper, the case of multiplayer non-signaling games is considered, i.e., the only restriction on the players is that they are not allowed to communicate during the game. For complete-support games (games where all possible combinations of questions have non-zero probability to be asked) with any number of players, we prove a threshold theorem stating that the probability that non-signaling players win more than a fraction 1-α+β of the n games is exponentially small in nβ<sup>2</sup> for every 0 ≤ β ≤ α. For games with incomplete support, we derive a similar statement for a slightly modified form of repetition.

This study contributes to the emerging research on social shared regulation in collaborative learning where collaborative groups are analyzed as the unit of analysis. Participants include 21 students who are learning mathematics at a vocational training institution in an online collaborative learning setting. Students' discussion scripts were collected and analyzed to identify the group strategies to regulate learning during solving Mathematics problem based on a coding scheme. Preliminary findings indicated that content-monitoring, content-evaluation and task-planning were the most frequent applied regulation strategies during online collaborative learning. Online collaborative learning results in socially shared regulation in groups however co-occurrence of self-, co- and shared regulation in online collaborative learning varies in relation to the type of regulation strategies implemented by the group. Future study should investigate on the ways to encourage all forms of regulation to co-occur during online collaborative learning.

However, the performance for rotation image is poor when one image is a rotated version of the other. To improve the matching accuracy of rotation image, we present an modified image matching algorithm combining Haar wavelet and the rotation invariant Local Binary Patterns (LBP). Firstly, keypoints are extracted from the images for matching by applying the Hessian matrix and integral images. Secondly, each keypoint is described by the Rotation Invariant LBP patterns and Haar wavelet, which are computed from the image patch centered at the keypoint. Finally, the matching pairs between the two sets of keypoints are determined by using the nearest neighbor distance based on matching strategy.

Instead of building a full and global 3D map of the environment, the approach exploits line and dense features extracted from RGB-D sensors. Wall-floor boundary lines are extracted from pre-processed point clouds, which ensure reliable line segmentation results compared with monocular based methods. A strategy is then proposed to compute the reference tracking points along the corridor for a wall-following behaviour. Meanwhile, dense 3D point clouds with ground-plane removed are projected which provide occupancy information, so that existing obstacle avoidance algorithms can be reused. A goal-directed navigation function is also developed by constructing a Nearness Diagram based obstacle avoidance behaviour guided by a wall-following behaviour. Experiment results validate the practicability and effectiveness of the approach.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1762-4; POD:978-1-4799-1763-1","10.1109/IECON.2015.7392367","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7392367","Floor plane extraction;Mobile Robot;Obstacle Avoidance;RANSAC;RGB-D Sensor","Collision avoidance;Feature extraction;Navigation;Robot sensing systems;Three-dimensional displays","feature extraction;image colour analysis;mobile robots","RGB-depth cameras;dense feature extraction;goal-directed navigation function;line feature extraction;line segmentation;mobile robot navigation;nearness diagram based obstacle avoidance behaviour;point clouds;reference tracking points;wall-following behaviour","","","","16","","","","9-12 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These solutions are seen as contributors in creating a Smart City. In Europe Smart Cities have been implemented, while South Africa has only recently started with Smart City initiatives. Current thinking has been to replicate international Smart City instances in South Africa. However, an open question is raised if this is an optimal strategy as differences in context might impact on the delivery of services. This paper extracts and compares contextual differences between Europe and South Africa, and based on those insights analyse whether full European solutions will deliver on the promise of a South African Smart City. Furthermore the question is raised if insights into a South African Smart City can strengthen European initiatives.

Teaching programming needs careful selection of different supportive pedagogical methods to help students progress. When the teaching does not meet students' expectations, frustration occurs. Programming is usually introduced to Information Technology students in their first year of study. Different types of new students exist - some are prepared for university studies and others struggle. Students' engagement affects students' success or failure rates in programming. Only engaged students can allocate time on doing programming related activities. Engaged students who come to class with positive outlook are more likely to achieve better. Frustration can hinder the process of learning and it can occur when teaching methods don't appeal to students or when students don't receive timely feedback on their programming errors. From the literature, learning strategy, collaboration, self efficacy, time availability, interest, support, scaffolding, availability of devices and resources and comfort level were identified as the leading attributes that affect engagement in programming.

The main reason that players continue to play video games is that the game designers use scaffolding to bridge the gap between a player's current skills and those needed to be successful at the next level. Several mainstream digital games have the flexibility to become promising game-based learning environments, in which scaffolding could play a crucial role to improve the learning experience. This study examines the effectiveness of providing instructors with the opportunity to tailor a digital game in order to meet their personal teaching goals. The built-in game features in Crayon Physics Deluxe are blended with instructor-designed scaffolding to see whether such features can assist learning without impeding creativity. A total of 126 participants were divided into four groups. In three of the groups, Crayon Physics Deluxe was used with varied scaffolding conditions: demonstration scaffolding, non-scaffolding, and marking critical features scaffolding. The fourth group did not play the game. Learning outcomes were examined in terms of physics knowledge acquisition (in the form of concept maps) and creativity performance (in the form of game episode designs). The results show that the marking critical features scaffolding group performed significantly better than the demonstration scaffolding group in both conceptual knowledge acquisition and in the sensitivity dimension of design creativity. The group with demonstration scaffolding scored higher in the flexibility dimension of creativity when designing their own game episodes. These findings suggest that proper scaffolding does facilitate learning, and different learning purposes require various designs of scaffoldings.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9958-3; POD:978-1-4799-9959-0","10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2015.302","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7373920","applications in subject areas;improving classroom teaching;media in education;pedagogical issues;teaching/learning strategies","Education;Games;Knowledge acquisition;Machinery;Physics;Sensitivity","computer aided instruction;computer games;knowledge acquisition;physics computing;teaching;video signal processing","Crayon Physics Deluxe;Physics knowledge acquisition;Physics learning;creativity performance;customized scaffolds;demonstration scaffolding condition;digital games;educational game;entertainment source;game-based learning environments;learning experience improvement;marking critical features scaffolding condition;nonscaffolding condition;personal teaching goals;video games","","","","24","","","","12-16 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, it is important to cultivate students' communication and problem solving abilities while they observe and investigate novel facts in Astronomy in-field learning activity. Therefore, it becomes an important issue to develop an integrated curriculum combining collaborative inquiry-based leaning tasks and u-learning activity in Astronomy courses. WebQuest instructional strategy has shown the potential for enhancing students' inquiry competence in web-based learning environment. Teachers encourage students to participate in the process of searching for knowledge, evaluating the information they have found and achieving their learning performance on different topics in a WebQuest learning activity. Therefore, in this study, a WebQuest-based context-aware u-learning system is proposed for conducting the collaborative inquiry-based learning activities in Astronomy courses. Two Astronomy learning tasks will be conducted in the Astronomy museum in an elementary school. The students in the experimental group will be asked to find knowledge about Astronomy and use the information to solve problems collaboratively in the WebQuest learning tasks, while the students in the control group will learn collaboratively through general Astronomy context-aware u-learning system.

Lectures are by far the most prevalent method of education and will continue to be so in the foreseeable future. Worldwide about 100,000,000 lecture hours are given live annually and almost none recorded - even though student seek out recorded lectures.Existing lecture capture technology is a partial solution - but those systems are expensive, complex, and managing them (and the recorded lectures) requires an IT department. This results in only very few of the 100,000,000 lecture hours given annually by colleges around the world being recorded - an enormous waste of valuable content LectureMonkey is a student and teacher collaborative solution, which leverages students mobiles to record any lecture anywhere, turn any classroom into a collaborative, active classroom and any lecture into a blended learning experience. LectureMonkey has been doing research in the marketplace over the last two years - letting students and teachers use the system to record and share lectures. We have used iterative and agile methodologies to quickly modify the product based on feedback. During these iterations we have learned what works and what doesn't, and what it will take to spark mass lecture capturing. LectureMonkey has been downloaded about 60,000 times, and has been used to record around 2,800 lectures (about 180 a month). Lectures have been viewed 14,000 times by 3,400 users. Just imagine how learning would change if everyone knew that at the end of class they would have a recording available - not just audio, but rich media that includes audio, boards and presentation. Add student comments as a natural part of the flow of the recording, mix in sharing among classmates and you have a recipe to radically improve the way students learn. LectureMonkey provides the ability to automatically capture every lecture using smartphones, making those recordings a part of the class notes - which can be easily shared with a- d enhanced by classmates. Needing only a smartphone and access to the Internet, LectureMonkey combines lecture capture (high quality audio, board images and presentation capture) and collaborative comments into a crowd sourced, shared, multimedia summary of a class. Students can have all their lectures and notes in their pocket or in a browser - available anytime, anywhere.. LectureMonkey is the only solution for mass ad-hoc lecture capture for live lectures anywhere, anytime - even though lecture capturing has a proven benefit for students. . LectureMonkey modernizes class notes. Class notes are crucial to learning, but haven't really changed since the 1950's. Lecture Monkey combines lecture recording together with the mobile paradigms of texting, tweeting, snapchat for collaborative note taking to enhance learning. .

The new educational model is based on three clouds: a) the self-formation cloud which is composed of everything related to the student's education (curriculum, etc.); b) the learning paradigm cloud which is related to the paradigms, strategies, forms of assessment, and learning tools; and c) the knowledge sources cloud which is composed of all existing knowledge in the world, in all its forms, from all possible sources. To give support to the educational model, a web platform based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is proposed in this work. The system consists of three management layers; each one manages each one of the clouds described above. The implementation of each layer is made as web services.

These regional challenges include reduced college preparedness, a high incidence of poverty, low educational attainment, and a language barrier. In particular, first-year, first-term UTPA students are largely unprepared to take Calculus. This places an undue burden on the students, lengthens their time to graduation, and hinders their performance in many gatekeeper courses. The shortcomings that result in gatekeeper courses are especially acute and significantly hinder success in upper-division courses. To overcome these, the authors have identified four proven practices that will accelerate math-preparedness of incoming freshman, overcome misconceptions that hinder progression from lower to upper division, and enhance sustained student engagement throughout. Together these practices form a strategy intended to engender a sustainable ecosystem of student success in Engineering and Computer Science in the Rio South Texas Region.","","Paper:978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344276","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344276","","Calculus;Computer science;Ecosystems;Education;Logic gates;Sociology;Statistics","computer aided instruction;mathematics computing","Calculus;Engineering and Computer Science in the Rio South Texas Region;Rio South Texas;UTPA;University of Texas-Pan American","","","","9","","","","21-24 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It consists of a framework of services that are easily integrated from applications in API format. In order to achieve the objectives of this research, the proposed method consists of three (03) phases. The first phase was a systematic review of the ubiquitous learning environments in order to identify which architectural features and their learning processes are used in learning scenarios based on the context. In the second phase an installation designed with the Youubi ubiquitous environment proposed a learning scenarios and new pedagogical practice for teachers in higher education. The third stage will be the design of high fidelity of ubiquitous learning scenarios prototype. After that, the actions will consist in validating the ubiquitous learning scenarios. In this paper we present the results of the systematic literature review. From these outcomes, we will generate pedagogical strategies for ubiquitous learning scenarios.

These strategies have been introduced in the education, but not yet scientifically evaluated. This year, inspired by Peter Shull's FIE Workshop 2014 [1], we focused on the strategies also in engineering subjects. The usage of the strategies in different situations was evaluated by short questionnaires. The results show that all strategies are actively used in military context, and that they are also applicable in engineering subjects, having a positive effect on performance. However, the substance of the strategies in an academic perspective was not as clear as it was in military. In order to benefit from the strategies in engineering subjects the substance of the strategies needs to be discussed with the students. We also found that, the “ability to control”, alone had high influence to performance through military and engineering events indicating that this strategy might be the dominant strategy to achieve good performance.","","Paper:978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344120","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344120","","Conferences;Context;Correlation;Electronic mail;Stress;Training","educational administrative data processing;military computing;military systems","coping strategy;learning empowerment;military academy;military operation","","2","","31","","","","21-24 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper focuses on the computer science arm of the program. During the five years of National Science Foundation support, 100 percent of participants in STAIRSTEP Computer Science were retained as majors. Their grades in major courses were consistently higher and drop rates consistently lower than cohorts of students from the five-year period prior to inception of the program. Incoming enrollments in the Computer Science Department grew dramatically, as did undergraduate majors and degrees awarded. This paper briefly describes the strategies used in the STAIRSTEP model and describes in detail how activities supporting the strategies were implemented in the Computer Science Department. A formal assessment documents the positive impact that the program has had on the department and its students.

Schilling","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Milwaukee School of Engineering, Milwaukee, WI 53202","2015 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","20151207","2015","","","1","8","For many engineering students, freshman programming represents one of the hardest courses for them to master. Unlike other science fields, few students are routinely exposed to programming in the K12 system. This can make the freshman programming course daunting. However, in the field of software engineering, success in this area is vital, as success in nearly all future courses requires mastery of this skillset. In the engineering field, we find that many students are visual learners. These students learn best by seeing, and they can perform very well in the classroom with the appropriate usage of teaching styles. However, when it comes to providing feedback to students on submitted assignments, the main method employed is the written comment, which is not conducive to visual learners. From a faculty member's standpoint, this makes sense, as it is the simplest form of feedback. However, written feedback is often ineffective at improving student performance, as many students simply do not read the comments because the students feel they are not relevant to their performance. This can be compounded in the freshman year, as students are still learning what is meant to be an effective college student. At higher levels, an alternative feedback mechanism, namely asynchronous multimedia feedback, has shown great promise. In lieu of written feedback, students are provided feedback for software engineering exercises through the use of a short video made via video capture. The video captures in multimedia format the instructor's perceptions and actions when grading a given assignment. The video shows, in real time, what the instructor saw, whether it is a program crashing or the successful operation of the program. Furthermore, it provides the instructor the ability to potentially fix simple blatant errors and see the instructor's debugging strategy. The article describes the pedagogical foundation for the technique, specifics of the technique used, student perceptions o- the technique, and an assessment of the learning gains from using such a method in an introductory freshman programming course. In general, students are show to prefer the technique versus traditional grading, and a statistically significant improvement in overall outcomes for the experimental course is shown to exist. A statistically significant correlation between the watching of videos and outcomes is also shown.","","Paper:978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344103","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344103","assessment;asynchronous feedback;grading;video feedback","Computer crashes;Computers;Education;Multimedia communication;Programming;Standards;Streaming media","computer science education;feedback;multimedia computing;programming;software engineering;teaching","asynchronous multimedia feedback;freshman programming course;novice computer programmer;software engineering exercise;student perception;teaching style","","","","20","","","","21-24 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The presence of a few shortcut direct links transforms a regular network to a small world network resulting in achieving properties of high clustering coefficient and low average path length. In this paper, we propose a delay-optimized small world model for base station caching network to reduce the average network delay by decreasing multi-hop distance. In particular, we first study the degree-based and closeness-centrality shortcut addition strategies. To enhance these two strategies, we propose the delay-optimized shortcut addition strategy to decrease average network delay. The numerical results show that the proposed delay-optimized small world model can reduce the average network delay under remaining the clustering coefficient. Meanwhile, the average network delay with the proposal is 31.26% lower than that with the degree-based strategy, and is 18.78% lower than that with the closeness-centrality strategy.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6782-0; POD:978-1-4673-6783-7","10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343526","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7343526","Base station caching;average network delay;clustering coefficient;small world","Artificial neural networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Transforms;Wireless networks","cellular radio;delays;quality of service","advanced cellular networks;average network delay reduction;average path length;closeness-centrality shortcut addition strategy;clustering coefficient;degree-based strategy;delay-optimized shortcut addition strategy;delay-optimized small-world model;distributed base station caching;multihop distance;multihop transmission;network traffic load reduction;quality of service;shortcut direct links","","","","10","","","","Aug. 30 2015-Sept. 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in the wireless environment the Interest and Data, proposed in NDN, are usually flooded because of the absence of Forwarding Information Base (FIB). To tackle this problem, we propose HVNDN, a hybrid forwarding strategy through NDN. More specifically, HVNDN introduces opportunistic and probabilistic forwarding strategy for location-dependent and location-independent information, respectively, which takes full advantage of geographic information and the characteristics of named data in VANETs. To make Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication more effective and reliable, we design elaborate Interest and Data packets formats, retransmission and acknowledgement mechanism in HVNDN. Simulation results from NS-3 demonstrate that the proposed forwarding strategy outperforms the state-of-art scheme with less end-to-end delay and overhead.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6782-0; POD:978-1-4673-6783-7","10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343616","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7343616","","Delays;Land mobile radio;Large Hadron Collider;Mobile computing;Vehicles;Wireless communication","telecommunication network topology;vehicular ad hoc networks","HVNDN;TCP/IP;VANET;forwarding information base;hybrid information forwarding;location-dependent information;location-independent information;named data networking;opportunistic forwarding strategy;probabilistic forwarding strategy;vehicle-to-vehicle communication;vehicular ad hoc networks","","1","","12","","","","Aug. 30 2015-Sept. 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there may be some selfish agents that reject cooperation due to the cost of performing the requested task, even while taking benefit from network resources and using intermediate agents to send their requests. The existence of these nodes cannot be ignored; and system efficiency can significantly deteriorate as the number of such nodes increases. Thus, a special mechanism is needed in order to confront them. Here, local structural update based on fuzzy social plasticity is proposed to persuade cooperative behavior. In this mechanism, relationships with non-cooperative agents are disconnected and the more cooperative ones, i.e. those with a trusting history for cooperation, and closer agents are preferred for the chain of relationship by a fuzzy logic heuristic. The proposed strategy intensifies cooperation by diminishing the impact of non-cooperation and reinforcing that of the cooperation. The strategy is evaluated on some random networks with different cooperation rates. Results confirm increased network cooperation, even when the majority of the agents are non-cooperative.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7428-6; POD:978-1-4673-7429-3","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2015.7338035","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7338035","Cooperation;Fuzzy Logic;Multi Agent Systems;Reputation;Social Plasticity","Computers;Game theory;History;Peer-to-peer computing;Receivers;Sociology;Statistics","fuzzy set theory;game theory;multi-agent systems","fuzzy logic heuristic;fuzzy social plasticity;multiagent system","","","","33","","","","2-5 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model is verified by the statics and dynamics experiments. Then the dynamic, static performances as well as the energy consumption characteristics of the boom, arm and swing actuators are investigated under the condition of load sensing hydraulic system and the proposed system using the virtual prototype. The control strategy of the actuators is formulated according to their load condition and operation characteristics also based on the detailed analysis. After that, the physical prototype based on the proposed configuration system is established and its performance is tested.

The sensor system is composed of onboard motion sensors, a low-cost GPS receiver, a precise digital map, and multiple cameras. Data from the onboard motion sensors, such as yaw rate and wheel speeds, are used to predict the vehicle motion, and the GPS receiver is applied to establish the validation boundary of the ego-vehicle position. The digital map contains location information at the centimeter level about road surface markers (RSMs), such as lane markers, stop lines, and traffic sign markers. The multiple images from the front and rear mono-cameras and the around-view monitoring system are used to detect the RSM features. The localization algorithm updates the measurements by matching the RSM features from the cameras to the digital map based on a particle filter. Because the particle filter updates the measurements based on a probabilistic sensor model, the exact probabilistic modeling of sensor noise is a key factor to enhance the localization performance. To design the probabilistic noise model of the RSM features more explicitly, we analyze the results of the RSM feature detection for various real driving conditions. The proposed localization algorithm is verified and evaluated through experiments under various test scenarios and configurations. From the experimental results, we conclude that the presented localization algorithm based on the probabilistic noise model of RSM features provides sufficient accuracy and reliability for autonomous driving system applications.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2015.2450738","BK21; Industrial Strategy Technology Development Program of MKE; Korean government (MEST); 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education, Republic of Korea; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160754","Precise localization;autonomous car;autonomous driving;multiple cameras;particle filtering;probabilistic noise model of road surface marker (RSM) features;probabilistic noise modeling;road surface marker","Autonomous automobiles;Cameras;Feature extraction;Monte Carlo methods;Noise;Particle filters;Probabilistic logic;Sensor systems","Monte Carlo methods;cameras;cartography;feature extraction;image matching;image motion analysis;object detection;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","Global Positioning System;Monte Carlo localization algorithm;RSM feature detection;autonomous car localization;cameras;digital map;feature matching;lane markers;localization algorithm;low-cost GPS receiver;onboard motion sensors;probabilistic noise models;probabilistic sensor model;road surface marker features;stop lines;traffic sign markers;vehicle motion prediction","","2","","39","","","20150716","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Incentive Mechanisms for Economic and Emergency Demand Responses of Colocation Datacenters","N. H. Tran; C. T. Do; S. Ren; Z. Han; C. S. Hong","Department of Computer Engineering, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","20151117","2015","33","12","2892","2905","Demand response programs have been considered critical for power grid reliability and efficiency. Especially, the demand response of datacenters has recently received encouraging efforts due to huge demands and flexible power control knobs of datacenters. However, most current efforts focus on owner-operated datacenters, omitting another critical segment of datacenter business: multitenant colocation. In colocation datacenters, while there exist multiple tenants who manage their own servers, the colocation operator only provides facilities such as cooling, reliable power, and network connectivity. Therefore, colocation has a unique feature that challenges any attempts to design a demand response program: uncoordinated power management among tenants. To tackle this challenge, two incentive mechanisms are proposed to coordinate tenant power consumption for demand response under two different scenarios. First, in the case of economic demand response where the operator can adjust an elastic energy reduction target, we show that there is an interaction between the operator and tenant strategies, where each side maximizes its own benefit. Hence, we apply a two-stage Stackelberg game to analyze this scenario and derive this game's equilibria. However, computing these equilibria can be intractable with exhaustive search; therefore, we propose an algorithm to find the Stackelberg equilibria with linear complexity. Second, in the case of emergency demand response where a fixed energy reduction target must be fulfilled, we devise two incentive schemes with the distributed algorithms that can achieve the same optimal social cost. While the first algorithm is based on the dual-decomposition method that is suitable for nonstrategic tenants, the second one is designed for strategic tenants to achieve a unique Nash equilibrium of a bidding game. Finally, trace-based simulations are also provided to illustrate the efficacy of our proposed incentive schemes.","0733-8716;07338716","","10.1109/JSAC.2015.2483420","10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; 10.13039/501100003725 - National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7279054","Colocation datacenters;demand response;distributed algorithms;incentive mechanisms","Cooling;Economics;Game theory;Green communications;Load management;Power demand;Servers","computational complexity;computer centres;cooling;distributed algorithms;game theory;power aware computing;power consumption;power grids;power system management;power system reliability","Nash equilibrium;Stackelberg equilibria;bidding game;colocation datacenters;colocation operator;cooling;datacenter business;demand response programs;distributed algorithms;dual-decomposition method;economic demand responses;elastic energy reduction target;emergency demand response;fixed energy reduction target;game equilibria;incentive mechanisms;incentive schemes;linear complexity;multitenant colocation;network connectivity;nonstrategic tenants;optimal social cost;owner-operated datacenters;power control knobs;power grid efficiency;power grid reliability;reliable power;tenant power consumption;trace-based simulations;two-stage Stackelberg game;uncoordinated power management","","5","","40","","","20150928","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Efficient block assignment schemes such as dynamic channel assignment (DCA) and dynamic packet Assignment (DPA) have been analysed in the literature. The authors propose a block assignment strategy for video traffic which sends video bursts over multiple blocks of orthogonal frequency division multiplexed access subcarriers simultaneously considering the interference characteristics of the channel.

"A Novel Ranking-Based Clustering Approach for Hyperspectral Band Selection","S. Jia; G. Tang; J. Zhu; Q. Li","Comput. Vision Res. Inst., Shenzhen Univ., Shenzhen, China","IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","20151029","2016","54","1","88","102","Through imaging the same spatial area by hyperspectral sensors at different spectral wavelengths simultaneously, the acquired hyperspectral imagery often contains hundreds of band images, which provide the possibility to accurately analyze and identify a ground object. However, due to the difficulty of obtaining sufficient labeled training samples in practice, the high number of spectral bands unavoidably leads to the problem of a “dimensionality disaster” (also called the Hughes phenomenon), and dimensionality reduction should be applied. Concerning band (or feature) selection, conventional methods choose the representative bands by ranking the bands with defined metrics (such as non-Gaussianity) or by formulating the band selection problem as a clustering procedure. Because of the different but complementary advantages of the two kinds of methods, it can be beneficial to use both methods together to accomplish the band selection task. Recently, a fast density-peak-based clustering (FDPC) algorithm has been proposed. Based on the computation of the local density and the intracluster distance of each point, the product of the two factors is sorted in decreasing order, and cluster centers are recognized as points with anomalously large values; hence, the FDPC algorithm can be considered a ranking-based clustering method. In this paper, the FDPC algorithm has been enhanced to make it suitable for hyperspectral band selection. First, the ranking score of each band is computed by weighting the normalized local density and the intracluster distance rather than equally taking them into account. Second, an exponential-based learning rule is employed to adjust the cutoff threshold for a different number of selected bands, where it is fixed in the FDPC. The proposed approach is thus named the enhanced FDPC (E-FDPC). Furthermore, an effective strategy, which is called the isolated-point-stopping criterion, is developed to aut- matically determine the appropriate number of bands to be selected. That is, the clustering process will be stopped by the emergence of an isolated point (the only point in one cluster). Experimental results on three real hyperspectral data demonstrate that the bands selected by our E-FDPC approach could achieve higher classification accuracy than the FDPC and other state-of-the-art band selection techniques, whereas the isolated-point-stopping criterion is a reasonable way to determine the preferable number of bands to be selected.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2015.2450759","Guangdong Foundation of Outstanding Young Teachers in Higher Education Institutions; Shenzhen Scientific Research and Development Funding Program; Tencent ¿Rhinoceros Birds¿ Scientific Research Foundation for Young Teachers of Shenzhen University; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7161371","Band selection;density-based clustering;hyperspectral imagery","Accuracy;Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Correlation;Hyperspectral imaging;Training","geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;image classification","FDPC algorithm;Indian Pines data set;classification accuracy;clustering procedure;dimensionality reduction;exponential-based learning rule;fast density-peak-based clustering;hyperspectral band selection;hyperspectral imagery;hyperspectral sensors;isolated-point-stopping criterion;normalized local density;novel ranking-based clustering approach;spectral bands;state-of-the-art band selection techniques","","12","","52","","","20150717","Jan. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The pre-class quiz, in-class quiz, brainwave of attention levels, open-ended questionnaires, and the 20-minute structured interview were used in this study. This study was conducted over a period of three weeks. Over the three weeks, the teacher conducted “three types of polling activities.” Week 1 was devoted to individual clicker polling, Week 2 to group polling on tablets, and Week 3 to group polling on tablets with a competition game. The results showed that polling systems help promote learning outcomes, and if a team was given an opportunity to discuss a topic after it was announced, this would help to increase attention levels. This study suggests that future researchers could design team polling activities in which students can take turns acting as a group leader in order to help build a team consensus and to avoid passive group member participation.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-8268-7; Electronic:978-1-4673-8270-0; POD:978-1-4673-8271-7","10.1109/UMEDIA.2015.7297456","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7297456","IRS;attention;polling strategies;teaching strategies","Brain;Collaborative work;Computers;Education;Electroencephalography;Monitoring;Sun","computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational institutions;human factors","Taiwan;attention levels brainwave;brainwave signals;educational research methodology course;in-class quiz;national university;open-ended questionnaires;passive group member participation;polling strategy;polling technology;preclass quiz;student academic performance;student attention level;team polling activities","","","","12","","","","24-26 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The VM systems have been proven in the literature to be useful and helpful for students' learning. However, currently, most VM systems just try to mimic the physical microscopes and there is still a lot of room to improve their usefulness for educational purposes. In this paper, we discuss what kinds of features and technologies a VM system should have in order to support various pedagogical strategies. We discuss the features of an ideal virtual microscope system that are needed to make the histology learning more effective and efficient.

Failure to master this subject will inhibit students'' capabilities as they advance to higher levels. Algorithm visualization, as an effort to overcome the problem, has been growing towards gameful visualization recently that is presumed to be able to engage learners longer and more intensely. However, integrating algorithm visualization, game elements, and instructional design is not a trivial task as it requires a careful design. Hence, a conceptual model of how algorithm learning instructions, algorithm visualization, and gamification improve learning outcomes was developed. While instructional design concerns with developing the best strategy for learning, algorithm visualization functions as a cognitive support provider and gamification works by delivering engagement. Both cognitive support and engagement moderate the learning instructions that concern with enhancing learning outcomes. Principles and elements originating from the three domains have to be taken into consideration during the designing process to produce an artifact that can deliver the essential functions of each domain. A working artifact was then constructed, as the instantiation of the model, to validate whether the idea of integrating algorithm visualization and gamification into algorithm learning instructions is capable enough to improve learning outcomes. Based on our respondents'' learning outcomes, it was found the artifact can significantly improve the procedural knowledge of learners that are indicated by their increased capability in solving sorting algorithm problems.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8102-1; POD:978-1-4799-8103-8","10.1109/VS-GAMES.2015.7295785","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7295785","","Algorithm design and analysis;Arrays;Computer science;Games;Heuristic algorithms;Sorting;Visualization","computer aided instruction;computer science education;data visualisation;serious games (computing);sorting","algorithm learning instructions;algorithm visualization;cognitive support provider;computer science;gameful visualization;gamification works;learning outcomes;sort attack;sorting algorithm learning;student capabilities","","","","39","","","","16-18 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an ensemble criterion of deep neural networks that is based on the reconstruction error and present two strategies to solve the most important issues in ensemble learning of neural networks: component dataset sampling and output averaging. Component training datasets are selected according to the reconstruction error instead of random bootstrap sampling or re-weighting. Moreover, for each testing instance, we can compute the reconstruction error yielded by the sub-model simultaneously with the output. The reconstruction error is used as the weights in output averaging. From the perspectives of prediction interval and confidence interval, we demonstrated that smaller reconstruction error could ensure smaller prediction interval.

It is generally accepted that programming is one of those things that can only be learnt by doing and actively engaging with it. Parallel programming is a prime example of a programming area that students commonly struggle with. A major inhibitor is due to some of its abstract concepts, making it difficult to grasp a true understanding of the underlying principles in a traditional classroom setting. This paper discusses the underlying principles that motivated the development of Active Classroom Programmer (ACP), a tool for students to learn effective programming strategies with the guidance of their instructor. ACP aims to increase students skills in applying programming topics, by immediately engaging them with the newly introduced material. This is especially important in parallel programming, as the topics quickly progress onto the many parallelisation caveats (such as thread-safety, race conditions, and so on). While laboratory or homework exercises provide students with valuable hands-on experience (to apply newly taught concepts), this opportunity generally arrives too late after the material is presented in the lesson. To address this, a collection of parallel programming exercises are being developed for the NSF/IEEE-TCPP Curriculum Initiative on Parallel and Distributed Computing (as an Early Adopter award), with the help of ACP. Instructors are welcome to utilise any of the developed exercises, or even request a private ACP account for their own courses to program with their students.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7684-6; POD:978-1-4673-7685-3","10.1109/IPDPSW.2015.24","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7284383","Active Classroom Programmer;education;learning;parallel programming","Debugging;Education;Encoding;Observers;Parallel programming;Software","computer science education;parallel programming","ACP;NSF/IEEE-TCPP curriculum initiative;active classroom programmer;cognitive skills;distributed computing;instructor parallel programming;parallel computing","","","","25","","","","25-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this context data services are deployed on several clouds which make data integration face several heterogeneity problems. This paper proposes a secure-aware data integration (lookup, aggregation, correlation) strategies that can be performed on a multi-cloud environment guided by their respective SLA contracts.

As a result, some potential useful information is ignored.

But the existing solvers always encounter the contradiction between high precision and low time consumption. To solve this problem, this paper designs a new MIQP solver by developing a parallel branch-and-bound algorithm utilizing multi-point radiation based on the multithreading parallel structure of GPU. This solver can obtain the global optimal solution by inheriting the advantages of the classical branch-and-bound algorithm. To increase the efficiency of the MIQP solver, for the quadratic programming (QP) to be solved each time during iteration, we fully use the massive parallelism of GPU and adopt the discrete-time simplified dual neural network.

In this paper, we broadly analyzed the existing algorithms for LD tagSNPs selection in a single population. It can be concluded that the original greedy algorithm is easy to implement and TAGster refines the selection steps of the original greedy algorithm. Results suggested that HTag can receive the highest tagging efficiency. In addition, we found that the precinct partitioning strategy can dramatically reduce the runtime of TAGster and HTag.

In this context and to improve fault diagnosis accuracy and efficiency of a cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter system (CHMLIS), a fault diagnosis strategy based on the principle component analysis and the multiclass relevance vector machine (PCA-mRVM), is elaborated and proposed in this paper. First, CHMLIS output voltage signals are selected as input fault classification characteristic signals. Then, a fast Fourier transform is used to preprocess these signals. PCA is used to extract fault signals features and to reduce samples dimensions. Finally, an mRVM model is used to classify faulty samples.

In addition, our partitioning method can obtain dense blocks by analyzing the probability distribution of non-zero elements in a sparse matrix, and result in very low proportion of zero padded. We make the following significant contributions. (1) We present a partitioning strategy of sparse matrices based on probabilistic modeling of non-zero elements in a row. (2) We prove that our method has the highest mean density compared with other strategies according to certain given ratios of partition obtained from the computing powers of heterogeneous processors. (3) We develop a CPU-GPU hybrid parallel computing model for SpMV on GPUs and multicore CPUs in a heterogeneous computing platform. Our partitioning strategy has balanced load distribution and the performance of SpMV is significantly improved when a sparse matrix is partitioned into dense blocks using our method. The average performance improvement of our solution for SpMV is about 15.75 percent on multicore CPUs, compared to that of the other solutions. By considering the rows of a matrix in a unique order based on the probability mass function of the number of non-zeros in a row, the average performance improvement of our solution for SpMV is about 33.52 percent on GPUs and multicore CPUs of a heterogeneous computing platform, compared to that of the partitioning methods based on the original row order of a matrix.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2014.2366731","Hunan Provincial Education Department; Hunan Science and Technology Commission; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6965639","GPU;matrix partition;multicore CPU;probability distribution;sparse matrix-vector multiplication","Computational modeling;Multicore processing;Partitioning algorithms;Program processors;Sparse matrices;Vectors","graphics processing units;matrix multiplication;multiprocessing systems;parallel algorithms;sparse matrices;statistical distributions","CPU-GPU hybrid parallel computing model;balanced load distribution;heterogeneous computing platform;heterogeneous processors;multicore CPU;partitioned SpMV;probability distribution;probability mass function;sparse matrix partitioning strategy;sparse matrix-vector multiplication","","16","","36","","","20141124","Sept. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"A Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization for Covering Array Generation","H. Wu; C. Nie; F. C. Kuo; H. Leung; C. J. Colbourn","State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China","IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","20150728","2015","19","4","575","591","Software behavior depends on many factors. Combinatorial testing (CT) aims to generate small sets of test cases to uncover defects caused by those factors and their interactions. Covering array generation, a discrete optimization problem, is the most popular research area in the field of CT. Particle swarm optimization (PSO), an evolutionary search-based heuristic technique, has succeeded in generating covering arrays that are competitive in size. However, current PSO methods for covering array generation simply round the particle's position to an integer to handle the discrete search space. Moreover, no guidelines are available to effectively set PSOs parameters for this problem. In this paper, we extend the set-based PSO, an existing discrete PSO (DPSO) method, to covering array generation. Two auxiliary strategies (particle reinitialization and additional evaluation of gbest) are proposed to improve performance, and thus a novel DPSO for covering array generation is developed. Guidelines for parameter settings both for conventional PSO (CPSO) and for DPSO are developed systematically here.

In its 2010 Strategic Concept, NATO affirmed its engagement to reinforce the defence and deterrence of its state members. In this light, it has been suggested that the gamification of training and education for cyber security will be beneficial. Although serious games have demonstrated pedagogic effectiveness in this field, they have only been used in a limited number of contexts, revealing some limitations. Thus, it is argued that serious games could be used in informal contexts while achieving similar pedagogic results. It is also argued that the use of such a serious game could potentially reach a larger audience than existing serious games, while complying with national cyber strategies. To this end, a framework for designing serious games which are aimed at raising an awareness of cyber security to those with little or no knowledge of the subject is presented. The framework, based upon existing frameworks and methodologies, is also accompanied with a set of cyber security skills, itself based upon content extracted from government sponsored awareness campaigns, and a method of integrating these skills into the framework. Finally, future research will be conducted to refine the framework and to improve the set of cyber security related skills in order to suit a larger range of players.

In such scenarios, it is highly necessary to have proactive fault tolerance mechanisms that can help avoid significant number of failures. In this work, we have developed a mechanism for proactive fault tolerance using partial replication of a set of application processes. Our fault tolerance framework adaptively changes the set of replicated processes periodically based on failure predictions to avoid failures. We have developed an MPI prototype implementation, PAREP-MPI that allows changing the replica set.

Therefore, a new binaural sound source localization method based on generalized parametric model and two-layer matching strategy is proposed in this paper for complex environments. Firstly, cepstral prefiltering is utilized for dereverberation of binaural signals. Then, two binaural cues computed from a dual-channel frequency representation, are combined to estimate the azimuths of sources. Additionally, the generalized parametric model is presented to describe the relationship between the azimuth and binaural cues through finding the optimal scaling factors from training data. At last, a two-layer matching strategy based on Bayesian rule is used to make the final decision, which can effectively decrease the computation complexity.

To this end, a new paradigm is required for optimization of a more generalized environment. This environment would include various nodes of different processing and communication abilities constrained by circuit powers and residual energy over individual dynamic wireless channels. In this paper, we present a novel strategy named link capacity-energy aware wireless distributed computing (LEA-WDC) for maximizing the lifetime of a wireless network. The major advantage of LEA-WDC is its achievement of lifetime maximization by systematically reconciling highly coupled system parameters (tasks, processing power, communication power, and residual energy) in terms of the role of nodes and the layer of each node. To attain an optimal solution, we perform unique interworking optimization via decomposition in accordance with the roles of header and slave nodes. The evaluation results of our simulation verify that the lifetime is further maximized by finding the optimal transmission power of each node according to the Shannon capacity.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2014.2360372","Convergence Information Technology Research Center; 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; 10.13039/501100003621 - Ministry of Science, ICT&Future Planning; 10.13039/501100003665 - National IT Industry Promotion Agency; 10.13039/501100003725 - National Research Foundation of Korea; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6910304","Wireless distributed computing;interworking optimization;network lifetime;processing-power control;task-power allocation","Distributed computing;Downlink;Energy consumption;Resource management;Uplink;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","distributed processing;open systems;optimisation;radio links;radio networks;telecommunication computing;wireless channels","LEA-WDC;Shannon capacity;circuit powers;communication power;distributed computing;distributed nodes;dynamic wireless channels;generalized environment;interoperability;interworking optimization;link capacity energy aware WDC;link capacity energy aware wireless distributed computing;network lifetime maximization;optimal transmission power;optimization;processing power;residual energy;wireless network environments","","2","","26","","","20140925","Aug. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Analysts can use them to identify distinct movement patterns, such as trajectories with similar direction, form, length, and speed. However, less effort has been spent on finding the semantics behind movements, i.e. why somebody or something is moving. This can be of great value for different applications, such as product usage and consumer analysis, to better understand urban dynamics, and to improve situational awareness. Unfortunately, semantic information often gets lost when data is recorded. Thus, we suggest to enrich trajectory data with POI information using social media services and show how semantic insights can be gained. Furthermore, we show how to handle semantic uncertainties in time and space, which result from noisy, unprecise, and missing data, by introducing a POI decision model in combination with highly interactive visualizations.

In the literature, the advantages of using online forum have been widely discussed. However, when the students' online discussions at each stage are not guided systematically, the assignment development can be affected. To overcome this problem, a theoretical framework was developed. Through this framework, the teacher can guide the students throughout their online discussion with practical skills in developing their assignments and the processes of thinking within this learning activity, visible to both the students and the teacher. The research instruments used were questionnaires and the online forum. The questionnaires were used to gauge the respondents' background skills in using online forum.

Therefore it is important for engineering students to be trained in ill-structured problem solving. In this paper, we present a new teaching-learning strategy for ill-structured problem solving based on productive failure and instructor prompts. Students do unguided in-class exploration of engineering problems in groups, after which they receive instruction on problem solving strategies.

However, due to the ad hoc nature of femtocells, there is a great challenge to mitigate interference, which may seriously compromise the benefits promised by this novel network architecture. This paper investigates the distributed subchannel allocation (DSA) for cotier interference mitigation in OFDMA-based femtocells, where the femtocells and macrocell transmit on orthogonal subchannels. Particularly, to intuitively study system performance, we formulate this problem as a noncooperative rate maximization game where the utility of each player or femtocell access point is its capacity instead of the incoming interference. Unfortunately, the uncertainty of the existence of the Nash equilibrium for this game makes it difficult to design efficient distributed schemes. To address this issue, we introduce a state space to reflect players' desire for new strategies and then devise a utility-based learning model that requires no information exchange between different players. Utilizing this model, a utility-based DSA algorithm is developed. Moreover, it is analytically shown that the Pareto-optimal solution can be achieved with our proposed algorithm, and as a result, the overall capacity can be efficiently improved, and the system interference can be efficiently mitigated. Finally, simulation results verify the validity of our analysis and demonstrate that our scheme performs comparably or even better compared with the existing strategies, which require information exchange among different femtocells.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2014.2344434","111 Project; 863 Project; Key Laboratory of Cognitive Radio and Information Processing (Guilin University of Electronic Technology); Ministry of Education, China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6868315","Distributed subchannel allocation;Pareto optimality;femtocells;interference mitigation;orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)","Algorithm design and analysis;Femtocell networks;Femtocells;Games;Interference;Resource management;Tin","OFDM modulation;femtocellular radio;frequency division multiple access;game theory;interference suppression;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing","DSA algorithm;Nash equilibrium;OFDMA femtocells;Pareto-optimal solution;cotier interference mitigation;distributed subchannel allocation;network architecture;noncooperative rate maximization game;orthogonal frequency-division multiple access;orthogonal subchannels;state space;utility-based learning approach","","12","","37","","","20140730","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"PISA: Pixelwise Image Saliency by Aggregating Complementary Appearance Contrast Measures With Edge-Preserving Coherence","K. Wang; L. Lin; J. Lu; C. Li; K. Shi","Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","20150609","2015","24","10","3019","3033","Driven by recent vision and graphics applications such as image segmentation and object recognition, computing pixel-accurate saliency values to uniformly highlight foreground objects becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called pixelwise image saliency aggregating (PISA) various bottom-up cues and priors. It generates spatially coherent yet detail-preserving, pixel-accurate, and fine-grained saliency, and overcomes the limitations of previous methods, which use homogeneous superpixel based and color only treatment. PISA aggregates multiple saliency cues in a global context, such as complementary color and structure contrast measures, with their spatial priors in the image domain. The saliency confidence is further jointly modeled with a neighborhood consistence constraint into an energy minimization formulation, in which each pixel will be evaluated with multiple hypothetical saliency levels. Instead of using global discrete optimization methods, we employ the cost-volume filtering technique to solve our formulation, assigning the saliency levels smoothly while preserving the edge-aware structure details. In addition, a faster version of PISA is developed using a gradient-driven image subsampling strategy to greatly improve the runtime efficiency while keeping comparable detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on a number of public data sets suggest that PISA convincingly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, with this work, we also create a new data set containing 800 commodity images for evaluating saliency detection.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2015.2432712","Education and Research of Guangdong Province; Guangdong Natural Science Foundation; Human-Centered Cyber-Physical Systems Programme through the Advanced Digital Sciences Center within the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore; Program of Guangzhou Zhujiang Star of Science and Technology; Special Project on Integration of Industry; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7106497","Visual saliency;feature engineering;image filtering;object detection","Coherence;Computational modeling;Context;Feature extraction;Histograms;Image color analysis;Image edge detection","edge detection;gradient methods;image colour analysis;image filtering;image sampling;minimisation","PISA;cost-volume filtering technique;edge-preserving coherence;energy minimization formulation;fine-grained saliency detection;gradient-driven image subsampling strategy;image domain;multiple hypothetical saliency level;neighborhood consistence constraint;pixelwise image saliency aggregating","","28","","44","","","20150513","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our goal is to optimize the transmit power of the source and the beamforming weights of the relays jointly for secrecy rate maximization subject to the minimum signal-to-interference-noise-ratio (SINR) constraint at each user, and the individual and total power constraints. Mathematically, the optimization problem is non-linear and non-convex, which does not facilitate an efficient resource allocation algorithm design. As an alternative, a null space beamforming scheme is adopted at the relays for simplifying the joint optimization and eliminating the confidential information leakage in the second cooperative phase, where the relay beamforming vector lies in the null space of the equivalent channel of the relay to eavesdropper links. Although the null space beamforming scheme simplifies the design of resource allocation algorithm, the considered problem is still non-convex and obtaining the global optimum is very difficult, if not impossible. Employing a sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) method, we propose an iterative algorithm to obtain an efficient solution of the non-convex problem. Besides, the proposed joint design algorithm requires a feasible starting point, we also propose a low complexity feasible initial points searching algorithm.

Therefore, fairness is an important feature for designers of these networks. Prevention of free-riding is a key aspect for fairness. One of the most important file-sharing protocols in P2P is BitTorrent. This protocol is distinguished from other P2P systems for its unique way of uploading process and its novel approach to fairness. For the first time by implementing eminent game theory strategy, “tit-for-tat” for its protocol, BitTorrent made a breakthrough on fairness for P2P networks. However, it did not take long for researchers to find security holes in its approach. It was proven several times that by making specific clients which do not follow BitTorrent algorithms, it is possible to achieve free-riding. In this paper, by making fairness a universal problem we make free-riding a much harder process. This is achieved by changing the role of Tracker from an indexing server to a more intelligent entity which makes the proper decisions based on different situations.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8069-7; POD:978-1-4799-8070-3; USB:978-1-4673-6900-8","10.1109/ICNSC.2015.7116022","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116022","BitTorrent;Fairness;Free-riding;P2P;Tracker","Bandwidth;Indexing;Limiting;Nickel;Peer-to-peer computing;Protocols;Servers","game theory;peer-to-peer computing;protocols;security of data","BitTorrent protocol;P2P networks;Tracker;counter attack;file-sharing protocols;free-riders;game theory strategy;indexing server;peer-to-peer networks;security hole;tit-for-tat","","1","","23","","","","9-11 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A Hough transform and dynamic programming are utilized for estimating a piecewise linear function to achieve robustness against outliers and guarantee optimal parameters. In the experiment, a performance evaluation and comparison were conducted using three publicly available databases.

Improvements have been made to both permutation and diffusion methods to address the security problems encountered by many existing chaos-based image ciphers. In the permutation stage, a pixel swapping-based strategy is introduced instead of using the area-preserving chaotic maps, and the swapping operation is determined by the first two state variables of the employed 4-D hyperchaotic system. During the diffusion procedure, the key stream elements, quantified from the other two state variables, are circularly shifted according to the plain-pixels. Consequently, the keystream is related to both the key and the plain-image, which ensures the security against known/ chosen-plaintext attack. Thorough experimental tests are carried out and the results indicate that the proposed scheme provides an effective way for online secure medical image transmission over public networks.","2326-828X;2326828X","Electronic:978-1-4799-8072-7; POD:978-1-4799-8073-4","10.1109/ISMICT.2015.7107507","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7107507","hyperchaotic system;medical image protection;permutation-diffusion;pseudorandom number sequence","Biomedical imaging;Chaotic communication;Ciphers;Encryption","chaos;cryptography;medical image processing;telecommunication security;telemedicine;visual communication","area-preserving chaotic maps;chaos-based image ciphers;chosen-plaintext attack;hyperchaos-based encryption;medical image protection scheme;pixel swapping-based strategy;security problems;teleradiology services","","2","","10","","","","24-26 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the node usually only has the local CSI between itself and other nodes, and lacks the CSI between any pair of other nodes. To enable all the nodes to get the global CSI, in this paper, we propose a network-coded third-party information exchange scheme, with an emphasis on minimizing the total transmission cost for ( ) exchanging the CSI among the nodes. We show that for a network of N nodes, if and only if any k nodes (1 ≤ k <; N) send at least (2 : k) packets, a feasible solution exists for third-party information exchange. Formulating the problem of feasible and optimal solutions as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, we compute the optimal number of packets that must be transmitted by every node. Guided by the necessary and sufficient condition, we construct two practical transmission schemes: fair load (FL) scheme and proportional load (PL) scheme. A deterministic encoding strategy based on XORs coding over GF(2) is further designed to guarantee that with FL or PL scheme, each node finally can decode the complete packets. It is shown that in two specific networks, these two schemes are optimal, achieving the minimum transmission cost. In more general networks, simulation results show that PL is still close to optimal with a high probability. Finally, a distributed transmission protocol is developed, which allows FL and PL schemes to be operated in a distributed and hence scalable manner.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2014.2350989","Singapore University of Technology and Design; State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University; 10.13039/100000001 - National Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Nature Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6882233","Network coding;channel state information;cooperative data exchange","Batteries;Educational institutions;Encoding;Information exchange;Mobile computing;Network coding;Vectors","integer programming;linear programming;network coding;radio networks","CSI;XOR;channel gain;channel state information;fair load scheme;integer linear programming;link loss probability;network coding;network-coded third-party information exchange scheme;proportional load scheme;transmission cost;wireless networks","","6","","32","","","20140822","June 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Mobile devices have resource limitations. Consequently, web pages designed for desktop browsing cannot be well displayed on mobile devices. Thus, dynamically transforming web contents designed for desktops into contents which can be displayed in a mobile device is an important task. Various approaches of content adaptation have been proposed to achieve this goal, but no single content adaptation strategy has been found to be effective. On the other hand, e-learning contents have grown manifold over years. In this paper, we provide a framework for an e-learning content adaptation system that can be used with desktops and mobile devices seamlessly.

Such environments enable users to control equipment and collect data without being present in the laboratory. This also means that users work in a disjoint manner and cannot coordinate equipment usage directly with each other, as they would do in regular on-site laboratories. Remote laboratory management systems deal with scheduling users, as most instruments cannot process multiple users' requests at the same time. Two scheduling strategies are predominantly used in RALs: time slotting and the queuing. This is straightforward in centralised, service-oriented environments, in particular, when instruments are available continuously throughout the day. In this paper, time scheduling in the context of a Distributed Peer-to-peer Remote laboratory featuring quest-based learning, is discussed. Here interaction with the entire system is organised around a set of learning activities or quests. This includes the experiments designed by users and the sharing of experiments by users. The providers of the experiments have the flexibility to put their systems online as per their capabilities. As such, the experiments availability become scarcer and must be judiciously assigned to the users who need them most.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7672-0; POD:978-1-4799-7673-7; USB:978-1-4799-7671-3","10.1109/TALE.2014.7062615","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062615","e-learning systems;learning management system;peer-to-peer network;remote laboratory;scheduling","Conferences;Decision support systems;Electronic learning;Peer-to-peer computing;Polynomials;Remote laboratories","Internet;STEM;computer aided instruction;peer-to-peer computing;scheduling","Internet;RAL;STEM education;centralised environment;distributed peer-to-peer remote laboratory;online environments;peer-to-peer remote access laboratory;quest-based learning;remote access laboratories;remote laboratory management systems;service-oriented environment;time scheduling;time slotting;user scheduling","","0","","14","","","","8-10 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Business process (BP) that facilitates the organization cooperation and resource sharing plays an important role in CC. The execution efficiency of BP has a pivotal impact on the quality of community cloud services. CC applications often have high demands on BP execution efficiency, which is affected by many factors such as response time of a single service in BP and cost of interactive activities among distributed services. This brings up an important research issue of optimizing BP execution efficiency for CC. In this paper, we propose a service replica strategy that utilizes queuing theory to optimize the execution efficiency of BP for CC. Our approach creates service replicas dynamically to shorten the response time of request to a single service according to the quantity and frequency of user requests in different times, and allocates these replicas to proper host servers to reduce the interaction time among distributed services. Our objective is to improve the BP execution efficiency by the above two aspects of local time optimization. First, we analyze the effects of service replica strategy on optimizing BP execution efficiency as a whole and define a cost model of execution efficiency to reduce the search space of maximizing execution efficiency of BP. Then we implement the replica strategy in two steps. We initially utilize the social network property of the services to pre-allocate key service replicas on server nodes in CC. After that, we utilize a queueing model to schedule the service replica and service requests dynamically. Experiments illustrate that our approach can help to improve BP execution efficiency in CC.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6621-9; POD:978-1-4799-6622-6","10.1109/CCBD.2014.39","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062876","business process;community cloud;execution efficiency;queueing theory;service replica","Business;Cloud computing;Communities;Servers;Social network services;Time factors;Time-frequency analysis","business data processing;cloud computing;queueing theory;resource allocation;scheduling","BP execution efficiency;CC;business process efficiency optimization;cloud service quality;community cloud;cost model;distributed services;organization cooperation;queueing theory;resource sharing;service replica scheduling;service replica strategy;service request scheduling;social network property;user request","","0","","20","","","","12-14 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This technique characterizes structural damage quantitatively, regardless of its quantity, and consequently evaluates structural integrity in a real-time manner. A self-contained system is accordingly configured to materialize this technique, which integrates modularized components through a bus called Peripheral component interconnect eXtensions for Instrumentation (PXI), for active GW generation, multichannel data acquisition, central control, signal postprocessing, and results presentation. The monitoring results are presented in pixelated images by virtue of a diagnostic imaging algorithm, facilitating comprehension of the overall structural health status intuitively, promptly, and automatically. In conjunction with the system, a sensing technique, based on a concept of decentralized standard sensing, is demonstrated, which has a capacity of constructing a sensor network with convenience and flexibility. An optimal benchmarking strategy in accordance with signal correlation is formulated to compensate for the adverse ambient influence (e.g., temperature fluctuation) in rugged measurement conditions. Experimental validation is carried out to verify the technique and the system by evaluating mock-up damage in planar and tubular structures quantitatively, showing superior detectability, sensitivity, and accuracy.

The CIRAX project aims to promote and consolidate a teaching community which should be active in the creation, updating and sharing resources, and learning practices. The tool for achieving this goal is a repository-in-collaboration where resources could be shared, well-catalogued and well-managed. In light of the experience, we have identified the factors that influence sharing and reusing resources and which have been tested on university teaching staff of introductory math courses. Among these factors, we have observed a high degree of sharing practice but constraints on reusing, due to prioritization of time and a lack of information regarding open licenses. The first year results allow us to establish essential lines of action in order to consolidate and enhance this experience within the mathematical teaching community at the Catalan university system: a) simplify the prototype and its workflows; b) articulate the shared resources in a normalized and clear way; c) develop strategies for consolidating the community and dissemination of information; and d) enhance the institutional recognition of teaching practice.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4799-3922-0; POD:978-1-4799-3923-7; USB:978-1-4799-3921-3","10.1109/FIE.2014.7044357","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044357","CIRAX;Catalan University System;Open Educational Resources;interuniversity collaboration;repositories;teaching quality","Collaboration;Communities;Educational institutions;Materials;Mathematics;Prototypes","educational courses;educational technology;information dissemination;mathematics computing;teaching","CIRAX pilot experience;Catalan university academic staff;Col·laboratori interuniversitari de recursos d'aprenentatge en xarxa;influence sharing;information dissemination;information technologies;institutional recognition;interuniversity collaboration;introductory math courses;knowledge-sharing communities of practice;learning practices;mathematical teaching community;open licenses;openness movement;teaching practice;university teaching staff","","0","","22","","","","22-25 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Representative SNPs are not only instrumental in reducing the cost of genotyping, but also serve an important function in narrowing the combinatorial space in epistasis analysis. The capacity of kernel SNPs to unify informative SNP and tag SNP is explored, and inconsistencies are minimized in further studies. The correlation between multiple SNPs is formalized using multi-information measures. In extending the correlation, a distance formula for measuring the similarity between clusters is first designed to conduct hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering consists of both information gain and haplotype diversity, so that the proposed approach can achieve unification. The kernel SNPs are then selected from every cluster through the top rank or backward elimination scheme. Using these kernel SNPs, extensive experimental comparisons are conducted between informative SNPs on haplotype reconstruction accuracy and tag SNPs on haplotype coverage. Results indicate that the kernel SNP can practically unify informative SNP and tag SNP and is therefore adaptable to various applications.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2014.2351797","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Hunan Provincial Innovation Foundation For Postgraduate; National Nature Science Foundation of China; National Nature Science Foundation of Hunan province; Planned Science and Technology Project of Hunan Province; 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; 10.13039/501100004602 - Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6894187","Tag SNP;clustering;informative SNP;support vector machine","Accuracy;Bioinformatics;Computational complexity;Correlation;Entropy;Kernel","bioinformatics;genetics;genomics;pattern clustering;polymorphism","backward elimination scheme;combinatorial space;epistasis analysis;genotyping;haplotype coverage;haplotype diversity;haplotype reconstruction accuracy;hierarchical clustering method;information gain;multiinformation measures;representative single nucleotide polymorphisms;selecting kernel SNP;tag SNP;unify informative SNP","Cluster Analysis;Computational Biology;Databases, Genetic;Haplotypes;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Support Vector Machine","1","","26","","","20140908","Jan.-Feb. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In a WBAN, network longevity is a major challenge due to the limitation of the availability of energy supply in body nodes. Therefore, routing protocols can play a key role towards making such networks energy efficient. In this work, we exhibit that a routing protocol together with an effective body node coordinator (BNC) deployment strategy can influence the network lifetime eminently. Our initial work shows that the variation in the placement of a BNC within a WBAN could significantly vary the overall network lifetime. This motivated us to work on an effective node placement strategy for a BNC, within a WBAN; and thus we propose three different BNC placement algorithms considering different features of available energy efficient routing protocols in a WBAN.

Such problems involve the building of physical and mathematical models of real-world scenarios, identifying correct parameters of the model, devising numerical solution methods, and optimizing the solution. In typical engineering courses, solution methods are demonstrated in problem-solving tutorials while programming is relegated to homework or lab, wherein students may not get ample feedback on their choices of optimization or solution evaluation. In this paper, we propose a strategy, Guided Problem Solving and Group Programming (GPGP) to overcome this gap. Students work in peer groups within class, to build and implement their mathematical models and solutions, then write programs to do optimization and evaluation. We implemented this strategy in a 4th year electrical engineering course in which GPGP was done four times over the semester. We assessed students' performance on dimensions of problem solving such as representing the problem, developing solution, making justification for proposed solution and monitoring and evaluating problem space and solutions across the semester and found a statistically significant improvement. Further students perceived that they had learned engineering problem solving via GPGP and reported enjoying the strategy in class.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6489-5; POD:978-1-4799-6490-1","10.1109/T4E.2014.10","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009553","GPGP;MEA;PBL;engineering problem solving;peer interactions;question prompts;scaffolding","Education;Mathematical model;Numerical models;Problem-solving;Programming profession;Writing","computer aided instruction;educational courses;electrical engineering computing;electrical engineering education;further education;parameter estimation;teaching","GPGP;electrical engineering course;engineering courses;engineering problem solving;group programming;guided problem solving;numerical solution methods;parameter identification;problem-solving tutorials;real-world scenarios mathematical model;real-world scenarios physical model;solution optimization;technology-enhanced teaching-learning strategy;undergraduate engineering education","","1","","26","","","","18-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main core of planners is provided by the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL). Different basic planners can be flexibly used and parameterized, allowing students to gain insight into the different planning algorithms. Among the advanced features the tool allows to easily define the coupling between degrees of freedom, the dynamic simulation and the integration with task planers.

The loads are modulated by shifting their demand characteristics along the time horizon, i.e., orchestrating the starting instants. Through flattening peaks and valleys of the demand curve, generating units are released from the burden of frequent output adjustments and a higher operating efficiency can be achieved. An optimal day-ahead dispatch strategy is proposed for deferrable loads. The next-day demand characteristics of the deferrable loads can be derived using historical data or behavior analysis. The starting instants of the loads are to be delicately delayed or advanced within the 24-h period. By such modulation, the aggregation of the controlled loads aims to closely track the dispatch objective that is assigned by the control center. An optimal model is constructed to describe the dispatch problem, which can be converted into a mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) one. The coefficients of the MIQP problem are computed using MATLAB. The solver SBB of GAMS is applied to solving the MIQP problem. Simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed optimal dispatch strategy.

Active distribution network is able to control the controllable units flexibly and effectively. Thus it can achieve optimal operation ensuring system stability and power quality. Based on the existing optimization strategies, this paper proposed two kind optimal strategies according to time scale, long-term comprehensive optimization (in 24 hours) and short-term real-time optimization (in 15 to 30 minutes), to achieve the most economical operation within one day with real-time error correction.

The allocation of switches is a possible strategy to improve reliability, by allowing network reconfiguration to isolate contingencies and restore power to dark areas. This paper proposes an optimization methodology to allocate switches on radially operated distribution networks. The solution framework considers sectionalizing and tie switches of different capacities, with manual or automatic operation schemes. The approach minimizes the costs of allocation and energy not supplied, under reliability and flow capacity constraints. The solution framework is based on memetic algorithm concepts with a structured population. Case studies with a large network and real-world scenarios were used to evaluate the methodology. The results indicate that significant cost reductions can be achieved using the proposed solutions.","0885-8950;08858950","","10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2322811","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6819475","Distribution system reliability;memetic algorithms;optimal switch allocation;reliability estimation;reliability management","Memetics;Power system reliability;Reliability;Resource management;Sociology;Statistics;Switches","optimisation;power distribution reliability;switchgear","automatic operation;distribution networks;optimization method;power distribution systems;reliability analysis;switch allocation problems","","10","","29","","","20140521","Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The two normal fields, though contain some redundant geometry information of the same model, can provide additional information that the other field lacks. Thus, considering only one normal field is likely to overlook some geometric features. In this paper, we take advantage of the piecewise consistent property of the two normal fields and propose an effective framework in which they are filtered and integrated using a novel method to guide the denoising process. Our key observation is that, decomposing the inconsistent field at challenging regions into multiple piecewise consistent fields makes the two fields complementary to each other and produces better results. Our approach consists of three steps: vertex classification, bi-normal filtering, and vertex position update. The classification step allows us to filter the two fields on a piecewise smooth surface rather than a surface that is smooth everywhere. Based on the piecewise consistence of the two normal fields, we filtered them using a piecewise smooth region clustering strategy. To benefit from the bi-normal filtering, we design a quadratic optimization algorithm for vertex position update. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that our algorithm achieves higher quality results than current approaches on surfaces with multifarious geometric features and irregular surface sampling.","1077-2626;10772626","","10.1109/TVCG.2014.2326872","National Natural Science Foundation; Research Grants Council; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6822598","Mesh denoising;bi-normal filtering;feature preserving;piecewise consistence;piecewise smooth surface","Geometry;Noise;Noise measurement;Noise reduction;Optimization;Smoothing methods;Surface treatment","computer graphics;filtering theory;pattern classification;pattern clustering;quadratic programming;surface fitting","bi-normal filtering;classification step;geometric features;geometry information;mesh denoising technique;mesh surface;piecewise smooth region clustering strategy;quadratic optimization algorithm;vertex classification;vertex normal field;vertex position update","","10","","39","","","20140529","Jan. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The goal of this work is to build an Automatic Emotion Variation Detection (AEVD) system to determine each emotional salient segment in continuous speech. We focus on emotion detection in angry-neutral speech, which is common in recent studies of AEVD. This study proposes a novel framework for AEVD using Multi-scaled Sliding Window (MSW-AEVD) to assign an emotion class to each window-shift by fusion decisions of all the sliding windows containing the shift. Firstly, sliding window with fixed-length is introduced as the basic procedure, in which several different fusion methods are investigated. Then multi-scaled sliding window is employed to support multi-classifiers with different timescale features, in which another two fusion strategies are provided. Finally, a postprocessing is applied to refine the final outputs. Performance evaluation is carried out on the public Berlin database EMO-DB. Our experimental results show that proposed MSW-AEVD significantly outperforms the traditional HMM-based AEVD.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6284-6; POD:978-1-4799-6285-3","10.1109/ICOT.2014.6956642","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6956642","Emotion Detection;Emotion Variation;Multi-Scaled Sliding Window","Accuracy;Emotion recognition;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Speech;Speech recognition;Support vector machines","emotion recognition;human computer interaction;sensor fusion;signal classification;speech recognition","AEVD system;EMO-DB;MSW-AEVD;affective human computer interaction;angry-neutral speech;automatic emotion variation detection;continuous speech;emotion class assignment;emotion detection;emotion recognition;emotional salient segment;fixed-length sliding window;fusion decision;fusion method;fusion strategy;intelligent human computer interaction;multiclassifiers;multiscaled sliding window;performance evaluation;public Berlin database;window-shift","","0","","20","","","","20-23 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To this end, SDR is employed to reformulate the GLRT detection into a semidefinite programming (SDP) model, and two detectors, randomization-SDR (RSDR) and eigenvector-SDR (ESDR) are proposed on the order of O(M<sup>3.5</sup>) and O(M<sup>3</sup>), respectively. Complexity analysis validates that the SDR-MSD strategy is desirable owing to its reduced complexity, compared with the exponential-complexity sphere decoding (SD) MSD. Furthermore, Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed SDR detectors provide the bit error rate (BER) performance almost the same with that of the SD method, and the RSDR outperforms the ESDR at the price of slightly higher complexity.","1525-3511;15253511","Electronic:978-1-4799-3083-8; POD:978-1-4799-3084-5; USB:978-1-4799-3082-1","10.1109/WCNC.2014.6952353","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6952353","","Bit error rate;Complexity theory;Detectors;Matrix converters;Optimization;Receiving antennas;Transmitting antennas","MIMO communication;Monte Carlo methods;error statistics;relaxation;ultra wideband communication","BER;MIMO;Monte-Carlo simulations;UWB;bit error rate;complexity analysis;eigenvector-SDR;exponential-complexity sphere decoding;generalized likelihood ratio test multiple-symbol detection;multiple-input multiple-output ultra-wideband systems;randomization-SDR;semidefinite programming model;semidefinite relaxation","","1","","19","","","","6-9 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This task involves the analysis of thousands or hundreds of thousands of geographically referenced temporal profiles in the data. To cope with the amount of data, modelers combine aggregation of temporal profiles to single statistical values with visual comparison. Although this strategy is based on experience and a well-grounded body of expert knowledge, our discussions with domain experts have shown that it has two limitations: (1) using a single statistical measure results in a rather limited scope of the comparison and in significant loss of information, and (2) the decisions modelers have to make in the process may lead to important aspects being overlooked.","1077-2626;10772626","","10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346751","German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) via the Potsdam Research Cluster for Georisk Analysis, Environmental Change and Sustainability (PROGRESS); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876007","Ocean modeling;cluster ensembles;geospatial time;model assessment;series;visual analytics;visual comparison","Analytical models;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Data models;Geospatial analysis;Oceans;Visualization","data analysis;expert systems;geophysics computing;graphical user interfaces;learning (artificial intelligence);ocean waves;pattern clustering;statistical analysis;tides","clustering algorithms;clustering ensembles;data set differences;data set similarities;decision modelling;domain experts;expert knowledge;geographically referenced temporal profiles;geophysical process analysis;geophysical process detection;geophysical process representation;geospatial distribution;information loss;ocean currents;ocean model output;ocean model quality;parameterizations;reference data;statistical measure;statistical values;subjectivity reduction;temporal behavior;temporal profile aggregation;temporal profile cluster detection;temporal profiles;visual analytics;visual comparison;visual interface","","3","","43","","","","Dec. 31 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As a primitive operation, edit distance based string similarity search is to find strings in a collection that are similar to a given query string using edit distance. Existing approaches for answering such string similarity queries follow the filter-and-verify framework by using various indexes. Typically, most approaches assume that indexes and data sets are maintained in main memory. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we propose B<sup>+</sup>-tree based approaches to answer edit distance based string similarity queries, and hence, our approaches can be easily integrated into existing RDBMSs. In general, we answer string similarity search using pruning techniques employed in the metric space in that edit distance is a metric. First, we split the string collection into partitions according to a set of reference strings. Then, we index strings in all partitions using a single B<sup>+</sup>-tree based on the distances of these strings to their corresponding reference strings. Finally, we propose two approaches to efficiently answer range and KNN queries, respectively, based on the B<sup>+</sup>-tree. We prove that the optimal partitioning of the data set is an NP-hard problem, and therefore propose a heuristic approach for selecting the reference strings greedily and present an optimal partition assignment strategy to minimize the expected number of strings that need to be verified during the query evaluation. Through extensive experiments over a variety of real data sets, we demonstrate that our B<sup>+</sup>-tree based approaches provide superior performance over state-of-the-art techniques on both range and KNN queries in most cases.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2014.2309131","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6750698","B<formula formulatype=""inline""><tex Notation=""TeX"">$^+$</tex><mathgraphic graphicformat=""GIF"" fileref=""lu-ieq6-2309131.gif""/> </formula>-tree;Similarity search;edit distance;string","Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Indexing;NP-hard problem;Partitioning algorithms","computational complexity;formal languages;query processing;relational databases;trees (mathematics)","B+-trees;KNN queries;NP-hard problem;RDBMSs;data set optimal partitioning;edit distance based string similarity queries;edit distance based string similarity search;filter-and-verify framework;heuristic approach;metric space;optimal partition assignment strategy;pruning techniques;query evaluation;range queries;reference strings","","3","","30","","","20140228","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A major issue is how to design energy management strategy for ensuring the sustainability of energy computing while the computation processes and physical processes are continued to interact in CPS. To solve this problem, one solution is to modeling the energy management strategy as the balance between power produced by renewable resources and power demand of workload. In this paper, the energy management of lunar rover system is taken as an example, and a dynamic power balance strategy (DPBS) for energy-sustainable CPS system is proposed to keep balance among the output power of solar cell array (SCA), the state of charge (SOC) of battery and the power demand of workload. The DPBS can coordinate the work mode of workload and batteries, and ensure the sustainability of energy computing for lunar rover energy management.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2951-1; POD:978-1-4799-2952-8; USB:978-1-4799-2950-4","10.1109/ICCSE.2014.6926495","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6926495","Cyber-physical system;Energy management;sustainability","Batteries;Computational modeling;Computers;Embedded systems;Load modeling;System-on-chip","SCADA systems;energy conservation;finite state machines;primary cells;solar cell arrays;sustainable development","CPS;DPBS;SCA;battery state-of-charge;dynamic power balance strategy;energy management strategy;energy-sustainable computing;energy-sustainable cyber-physical system;lunar rover energy management;lunar rover system;power demand;renewable resources;solar cell array","","0","","10","","","","22-24 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The dominant curriculum models for software engineers has focused on the solution space's declarative knowledge and has mostly relegated problem solving skills to that of a consequence of the primary educational process. In this paper we present a constructivist aware strategy to amend software engineering curricula by integrating problem solving skill development. To build this approach we examined mathematician Gyorgy Polya's heuristic of a generalized problem solving model in the context of software engineering (SE) and propose the necessary augmentation to support skill development. We take the position that Polya's approach may not only functionally address well defined problems encountered at an introductory level but is expandable to tackle ill-structured or wicked problems inherent in the design of complex systems. We present a controlled classroom study which investigates the utility of the proposed methodology to address a set of welldefined problems in a small representative student sampling.

MapReduce is a programming model for processing mass data and suitable for parallel computing of big data. Therefore, this paper proposed an improved algorithm based on MapReduce and optimal search of medoids to cluster big data. Firstly, according to the basic properties of triangular geometry, this paper reduced calculation of distances among data elements to help search medoids quickly and reduce the calculation complexity of k-medoids. Secondly, according to the working principle of MapReduce, Map function is responsible for calculating the distances between each data element and medoids, and assigns data elements to their clusters; Reduce function will check for the results from Map function, search new medoids by the optimal search strategy of medoids again, and return new results to Map function in the next MapReduce process.

We focus on several features of SaaS competition, including differences in vendor offerings, incomplete information on application functionality, the potential lock-in risk of SaaS clients, and their cost of learning about what it will take to make the vendors' software work well. Clients can sample the fit costs of adoption, but can switch to another vendor. We obtained several findings through the use of a game-theoretic model. First, a client's switching cost is important for its decision-making regarding SaaS adoption. With a relatively high switching cost, a more cost-efficient vendor of IT services will be able to drive the less cost-efficient competitor out of its market. Second, the impact of the client's switching cost on vendors works differently. An increase in switching cost enables one vendor to charge a higher price and achieve higher profit, while the other will be forced to charge a lower price and hardly make a profit. Third, what matters is not how much a vendor can enhance service quality, but instead how costly it will be to improve quality enough to attract sufficient customer interest to achieve profitability.","0018-9391;00189391","","10.1109/TEM.2014.2332633","Lee Kuan Yew Faculty Fellowship for Research Excellence at Singapore Management University; Singapore's Ministry of Education Tier 1 Research Support Program; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6857369","Adverse and beneficial lock-in;cost efficiency;economic analysis;quality;services sampling;software-as-a-service (SaaS);strategy;switching costs;vendor competition","Costs;Economics;Software as a service;Subscriptions","DP industry;cloud computing;decision making;game theory;pricing;profitability","IT services;SaaS clients;SaaS competition;application functionality;client switching cost;decision-making;game-theoretic model;lock-in risk;pricing strategy;profitability;quality strategy;software-as-a-service vendors;vendor software work","","3","","50","","","20140716","Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The Marginalized Likelihood Ratio Test (MLRT) is proposed to detect, identify and estimate the NLOS multipath biases. However, the MLRT test statistics is generally difficult to compute. In this work, we consider a Monte Carlo integration technique based on bias magnitude sampling. The Jensen inequality allows this Monte Carlo integration to be simplified. The interacting multiple model algorithm is also used to update the prior information for each bias magnitude sample. Finally, some strategies are designed for estimating and correcting the NLOS multipath biases. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can effectively improve the positioning accuracy in the presence of NLOS multipath interferences.","","Electronic:978-8-4901-2355-3; POD:978-1-4799-1634-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915981","GNSS;MLRT;multipath mitigation;multiple model;urban positioning","Equations;Global Positioning System;Pollution measurement;Position measurement;Receivers;Satellites;Vehicles","Monte Carlo methods;radiofrequency interference;satellite navigation;signal detection;signal sampling","GNSS pseudorange measurements;Global Navigation Satellite Systems;Jensen inequality;MLRT;Monte Carlo integration;NLOS multipath bias;bias magnitude sampling;interacting multiple model algorithm;marginalized likelihood ratio test;nonline-of-sight multipath interference;position estimation;positioning accuracy;urban positioning","","0","","19","","","","7-10 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a distributed environment it is difficult to achieve this, as different resources have different configuration and capacity. Generally, load balancers generate the mapping of tasks to resources, based on some particular objectives. Load balancers employ a function that takes into account the necessary objectives to optimize a specific outcome. The commonly used load balancing objectives in a cloud computing environment are related to the tasks completion time and resource utilization. They use a specific approach for mapping the tasks to suitable cloud resources in order to satisfy user requirements. However, the majority of these strategies are static in nature. They produce a good schedule given the current state of cloud resources and do not take into account changes in resource availability. On the other hand, dynamic scheduled load balancer considers the current state of the system. It is adaptive in nature and able to generate efficient schedules. This improves the overall performance of the system. In this paper we have proposed a new technique to achieve load balancing called Load Balancing with Optimal Cost Scheduling Algorithm. The user selects a list of services available from the service pack. The scheduler processes these tasks to the virtual machine (VM) based on the configuration and computing power of the VM. This task is achieved with minimum execution cost which is a profit for the service provider and minimum execution time which is an advantage for both service provider and the user.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-3826-1; Electronic:978-1-4799-3827-8; POD:978-1-4799-3828-5","10.1109/ICCPEIC.2014.6915334","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915334","Cloud;Load Balancer;Scheduling;Virtual Machine","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Dynamic scheduling;Load modeling;Propulsion;Reliability;Scheduling algorithms","cloud computing;resource allocation;scheduling;virtual machines","VM;cloud computing environment;cloud resources;execution cost;execution time;load balancing objectives;load balancing technique;optimal cost scheduling algorithm;resource availability;resource management;resource utilization;task completion time;virtual machine","","2","","21","","","","16-17 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Feedback mechanism about learning engagement could be a source of assessment for the educators and the students. In online learning, not only the educators but also the students need to get informed about their learning engagements as cyberspace is not controllable for the educators and students could be in interaction with any content or human agency without teacher guidance and in this context, feedback based on analytical assessment is essential for the self-learning activities. Sometimes, in online group discussions, the teachers may not decide when to interrupt the ongoing discussions and in parallel with this, the students in a learning group may be in a vicious circle and repeatedly discussing the same topic without any advancement whereas critical thinking skills require adaptation of some instructional strategies. In these occasions, learning analytics (LA) is a key process to provide educational stakeholders with evidence based, analytical and contextual outcomes in a way of making sense of their learning engagements. In this conceptual framework, our research has attempted to examine sequential analysis as a likely method to get adapted by LA researchers with its prospects, opportunities and challenges. To this end, we focused on a part of a blended learning course and analyzed the students' online discussions to examine the method of sequential analysis with its potential to be an efficient tool to conduct learning analytics.

In order to solve this problem, this paper presents a fast restarting particle swarm optimization (FRPSO), which uses a novel restarting strategy based on a discrete finite-time particle swarm optimization (DFPSO). Taking advantage of frequently speeding up the swarm to converge along with a greater exploitation capability and then jumping out of the trap, this algorithm can preserve population diversity and provide a superior solution. The experiment performs on twenty-five benchmark functions which consists of single-model, multimodal and hybrid composition problems, the experimental result demonstrates that the performance of the proposed FRPSO algorithm is better than the other three representatives of the advanced PSO algorithm on most of these functions.","1089-778X;1089778X","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-6626-4; Electronic:978-1-4799-1488-3; POD:978-1-4799-1486-9","10.1109/CEC.2014.6900427","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6900427","","Algorithm design and analysis;Benchmark testing;Convergence;Oscillators;Particle swarm optimization;Sociology;Statistics","convergence;iterative methods;particle swarm optimisation","DFPSO;FRPSO algorithm;PSO algorithm;discrete finite-time particle swarm optimization;fast restarting particle swarm optimizer;iterative exploitation;iterative exploration;population diversity;swarm intelligence technique","","0","","15","","","","6-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the socio-technical mechanisms to enhance teamwork performance are lacking. To meet this gap, we adopt the social computing to affiliate learners' behaviors and offer them computational choices to build a better collaborative learning context. Combining the features of the cloud environment, we have identified a learning flow based on Kolb team learning experience to realize this approach. Such novel learning flow can be executed by our newly designed system, Teamwork as a Service (TaaS), in conjunction with the cloud-hosting learning management systems. Following this learning flow, learners benefit from the functions provided by cloud-based services when cooperating in a mobile environment, being organized into cloud-based teaching strategies namely “Jigsaw Classroom”, planning and publishing tasks, as well as rationalizing task allocation and mutual supervision. In particular, we model the social features related to the collaborative learning activities, and introduce a genetic algorithm approach to grouping learners into appropriate teams with two different team formation scenarios. Experimental results prove our approach is able to facilitate teamwork, while learners' capabilities and preferences are taken into consideration. In addition, empirical evaluations have been conducted to show the improvement of collaborative learning brought by TaaS in real university level courses.","1939-1382;19391382","","10.1109/TLT.2014.2340402","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6860285","Mobile cloud;collaborative learning;learning flow;learning styles;social computing;task allocation","Context;Mobile communication;Social computing;Teamwork;Virtual groups","cloud computing;computer aided instruction;mobile computing","Jigsaw Classroom;Kolb team learning;TaaS;TaaS approach;Teamwork as a Service;cloud based teaching strategies;cloud hosting learning management systems;collaborative learning;collaborative learning context;distributed learners;facilitating social collaboration;mobile cloud based learning;mobile environment;mobile learning;online courses;social computing;socio technical mechanisms;teamwork as a service;virtual teams","","7","","73","","","20140718","July-Sept. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We design a dynamic BCA scheme for SCN where each BS aims to balancing its load. To be specific, the light-loaded BS tends to attract more users while the heavy-loaded BS tends to discharge the current users. Firstly, a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization based algorithm is proposed towards the suboptimal solution for dynamic BCA. And then we put forward a distributed User-SCBS side BCA scheme.

Specifically tailored for the heterogeneity of the meter data traffic in the smart grid, we first design a novel utility function that not only jointly accounts for system throughput and transmission latency, but also allows for flexible tradeoff between the two with a strict transmission latency constraint, as desired by various smart meter applications. Then, we model the interactions among smart meter data concentrators as a mixed-strategy network formation game. To avoid potential information exchange which is not always practical in meter data collection scenario, a stochastic reinforcement learning algorithm with only private and incomplete information is proposed to solve the network formation problem. Such a problem formulation, together with our proposed stochastic learning algorithm on graph, results in a steady probabilistic route. Both contributions are novel and unique in comparison with existing work on this topic. Another distinct feature of our approach is its capability of effectively maintaining the QoS of smart meter data collection, even when the network is under fault or attack, as verified by simulations.","1536-1276;15361276","","10.1109/TWC.2014.2314121","Science Foundation for the Youth Scholar of Ministry of Education of China; 10.13039/100000001 - National Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779690","Network formation;smart grid;stochastic learning;wireless routing","Data collection;Games;Quality of service;Routing;Smart grids;Throughput;Wireless communication","graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;quality of service;smart meters;stochastic processes;telecommunication network routing;wireless channels","QoS-oriented wireless routing;mixed-strategy network formation game;network formation problem;smart grid operation;smart meter data collection;stochastic learning;stochastic reinforcement learning algorithm;transmission latency constraint;wireless channels","","5","","40","","","20140327","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While different algorithms have been proposed for tumor clustering, few make use of the expert's knowledge to better the performance of tumor discovery. In this paper, we first view the expert's knowledge as constraints in the process of clustering, and propose a feature selection based semi-supervised cluster ensemble framework (FS-SSCE) for tumor clustering from bio-molecular data. Compared with traditional tumor clustering approaches, the proposed framework FS-SSCE is featured by two properties: (1) The adoption of feature selection techniques to dispel the effect of noisy genes. (2) The employment of the binate constraint based K-means algorithm to take into account the effect of experts' knowledge. Then, a double selection based semi-supervised cluster ensemble framework (DS-SSCE) which not only applies the feature selection technique to perform gene selection on the gene dimension, but also selects an optimal subset of representative clustering solutions in the ensemble and improve the performance of tumor clustering using the normalized cut algorithm. DS-SSCE also introduces a confidence factor into the process of constructing the consensus matrix by considering the prior knowledge of the data set. Finally, we design a modified double selection based semi-supervised cluster ensemble framework (MDS-SSCE) which adopts multiple clustering solution selection strategies and an aggregated solution selection function to choose an optimal subset of clustering solutions. The results in the experiments on cancer gene expression profiles show that (i) FS-SSCE, DS-SSCE and MDS-SSCE are suitable for performing tumor clustering from bio-molecular data. (ii) MDS-SSCE outperforms a number of state-of-the-art tumor clustering approaches on most of the data sets.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2014.2315996","City University of Hong Kong; Cooperation Project in Industry, Education and Academy of Guangdong Province and Ministry of Education of China; Doctoral Program of Higher Education; Foundation of Guangdong Educational Committee; Fundamental Research Funds; Guangdong Natural Science Funds; Hong Kong Baptist University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Scholars Program; Key Enterprises and Innovation Organizations; NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund; National Natural Science Foundation; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Science and Technology Planning Project; key lab of cloud computing and big data in Guangzhou; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6783979","Cluster ensemble;feature selection;gene expression profiles;semi-supervised clustering;tumor clustering","Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;Cancer;Clustering algorithms;Gene expression;Mutual information;Tumors","aggregation;cancer;diagnostic expert systems;feature selection;genetics;medical diagnostic computing;molecular biophysics;pattern clustering;tumours","aggregated solution selection function;binate constraint based K-means algorithm;biomolecular data;cancer diagnosis;cancer gene expression profiles;cancer treatment;consensus matrix;double feature selection based semisupervised clustering ensemble;expert knowledge;gene dimension;multiple clustering solution selection strategies;noisy genes;normalized cut algorithm;optimal subset;traditional tumor clustering approaches;tumor discovery","Algorithms;Cluster Analysis;Computational Biology;Databases, Genetic;Gene Expression Profiling;Humans;Neoplasms;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Transcriptome","16","","49","","","20140407","July-Aug. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For this purpose, this article presents a modular approach for teaching module regarding three-phase thyristor rectifiers. A simulator based on the MATLAB equation solver has been developed by considering the detailed physical operation of such converters. In particular, the realized simulator takes various aspects into account, including continuous and discontinuous, commutation, its effect on the supply network and control parameters variations. The software modularity considers a very simple starting point and allows the extension to more complex topologies (bidirectional converters, cycloconverters and so on), maintaining always the same level of interaction with the students so that they can increase their skills and develop their own self-learning capability and self-training strategies.","","CD:978-1-4799-3786-8; Electronic:978-1-4799-3787-5","10.1109/EVER.2014.6844096","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844096","Equation oriented simulation software;Modular teaching approach;Power electronics;converters","Equations;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Rectifiers","commutation;educational courses;mathematics computing;power electronics;rectifying circuits;teaching;thyristor convertors;training;unsupervised learning","Matlab equation solver;bidirectional converters;complex topology;continuous commutation;control parameters variations;cycloconverters;discontinuous commutation;equation-oriented softwares;modern education system;modular approach;passive learning;physical operation;self-learning capability;self-training strategy;supply network;teaching module;teaching power electronics;teaching thyristor rectifiers;three-phase thyristor rectifiers;university courses","","0","","30","","","","25-27 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to combat the variable network resources, rate adaptation is adopted to meet the transmission rate of the varying network. However, being a resource-intensive application, a key research problem of rate adaptation is to make the best of bandwidth and provide a relatively stable high-quality media service. Besides, in HTTP streaming, it is difficult to differentiate between the short-term throughput changes which incurred by the TCP congestion control, and the throughput changes due to persistent bandwidth changes. Therefore, this problem becomes more challenging. In this paper, we propose a rate adaptation solution for our distance education system based on HTTP Live Streaming (HLS). Firstly, our solution adopts a bandwidth prediction algorithm based on download throughput samples, it can effectively measure the available bandwidth by dividing the segment into duration. Secondly, the solution proposes a threshold-based rate adaptation algorithm. We adopt two thresholds to design our adaptive strategy according to the predicted bandwidth, it successfully keeps our average bit rate in a higher level and gets a decent bandwidth utilization. At the same time, it provides a relatively stable video quality. Simulation results show that the proposed rate adaptation algorithm can strike a balance between bandwidth utilization and stability of video stream under a varying bandwidth condition1.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5088-6; POD:978-1-4799-0973-5","10.1109/HPCC.and.EUC.2013.344","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6832227","HTTP streaming;bandwidth prediction;distance education;rate adaptation algorithm","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Bit rate;Media;Streaming media;Switches;Throughput","computer aided instruction;distance learning;transport protocols","HLS;HTTP live streaming;HTTP streaming;TCP congestion control;adaptive strategy;adaptive streaming;bandwidth prediction algorithm;bandwidth utilization;distance education system;hyper-text transport protocol;media service;network service providers;rate adaptation solution;resource-intensive application;stable video quality;threshold-based rate adaptation algorithm;transmission rate;variable network resources;varying bandwidth condition;varying network;video stream","","0","","11","","","","13-15 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed approach is very fast to build, very compact while remaining robust to illumination variations, rotation changes, and noise. We develop a novel and simple strategy to compute a local binary descriptor based on the conventional local binary pattern (LBP) approach, preserving the advantageous characteristics of uniform LBP. Points are sampled in a circular neighborhood, but keeping the number of bins in a single-scale LBP histogram constant and small, such that arbitrarily large circular neighborhoods can be sampled and compactly encoded over a number of scales. There is no necessity to learn a texton dictionary, as in methods based on clustering, and no tuning of parameters is required to deal with different data sets. Extensive experimental results on representative texture databases show that the proposed BRINT not only demonstrates superior performance to a number of recent state-of-the-art LBP variants under normal conditions, but also performs significantly and consistently better in presence of noise due to its high distinctiveness and robustness. This noise robustness characteristic of the proposed BRINT is evaluated quantitatively with different artificially generated types and levels of noise (including Gaussian, salt and pepper, and speckle noise) in natural texture images.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2014.2325777","Doctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6819021","Texture descriptors;feature extraction;local binary pattern (LBP);rotation invariance;texture analysis","Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Histograms;Lighting;Noise;Robustness;Vectors","Gaussian noise;image classification;image representation;image texture;visual databases","BRINT;Gaussian noise;LBP approach;binary rotation invariant texture classification;circular neighborhood;clustering;illumination variations;local binary descriptor;local binary pattern approach;natural texture images;noise tolerant texture classification;representative texture databases;rotation changes;salt-and-pepper noise;single-scale LBP histogram;speckle noise;texton dictionary","","33","","43","","","20140520","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Henceforth, it is important to harness a student's reflective thinking in order to help him apply new knowledge in complex situations. The purpose of this study was to examine students' reflective thinking skill levels in online discussion forums via the E-learning. By adopting content analysis, a thematic analysis based on ""unit of meaning"" was conducted. This scheme consists of four levels of reflective thinking: stimulated reflection, descriptive reflection, dialogic reflection and critical reflection. This study was carried out in five weeks, involving among others, 34 undergraduate students enrolled in the Web Based Multimedia Development course. The inter-rater reliability was calculated and found satisfactory, with 94 percent of agreement. This study shows an increment of high levels of reflective thinking: dialogic reflection (increased by 13.98 percent) and critical reflection (increased by 19.81 percent). On the other hand, low levels reflective thinking decreased: stimulated reflection (decreased by 6.44 percent) and descriptive reflection (decreased by 27.35 percent).","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3592-5; POD:978-1-4799-3593-2; USB:978-1-4799-3591-8","10.1109/LaTiCE.2014.12","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821822","collaborative learning;higher order thinking;online discussion forum;reflective thinking","Collaborative work;Computers;Discussion forums;Education;Least squares approximations;Portals;Reflection","Internet;behavioural sciences;computer science education;courseware;multimedia systems","E-learning;Web-based multimedia development course;content analysis;critical reflection;descriptive reflection;dialogic reflection;inter-rater reliability;online discussion forums;problem solving strategies;stimulated reflection;student reflective thinking skill levels;undergraduate students","","0","","24","","","","11-13 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Application of the Pedagogical and Andragogical Model in Web-Based Learning Instruction Among Non-major Computer Science Students' Learning Programming","N. M. Noor; J. Harun; B.

The pedagogical and and ragogical learning orientation model differs in six assumptions about learners, which are: the learner's need to know, self concept, existing experience, readiness to learn, orientation to learning, and motivation [1]. Questionnaires were developed and distributed among 262 undergraduate students in non-major Computer Science Faculty who took the Introduction to Programming Language course. Descriptive analyses have also been conducted (alpha - 0.958), and the results showed that a majority of the sample in this study (246 respondents or 93.9%) stay under Stage 2 in the four stages of learning development. This means that the respondents had a high preference for pedagogical as well as and ragogical learning orientations. Data collected shows that non-major Computer Science students in the age range of 18 to 24 are able to work independently since their self-concept had progressed to the self-directed learning phase. However, they still need guidance from their lecturers. These findings were used to develop a prototype of an individualized online learning environment based on the pedagogy and and ragogy as its foundational model. Learners in Stage 2 need goal-setting, learning strategies, and evaluation to be set by the teacher. The online learning environment allowed the student to explore her learning modules from easy to hard levels. However, students were allowed to continue to the next module even though their performance was not yet at the passing level. This is based on and ragogical theory, that they are dependent learners with a moderate level of self-directedness. Additional learning materials were also provided that could be freely explored by learners at their own pace. The prototype was tested among one group of 32 students in the Faculty of Educa- ion in the course Introduction to Programming using Pre-Experimental Research Design. The statistical analysis conducted indicated that the application of the pedagogical and and ragogical Model in web based instruction had a positive effect on learners' outcomes.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3592-5; POD:978-1-4799-3593-2; USB:978-1-4799-3591-8","10.1109/LaTiCE.2014.27","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821837","andragogy;learning programming for non-majors;pedagogy","Computer languages;Education;Instruments;Programming profession;Prototypes","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;further education;programming","Faculty of Education;Web based instruction;Web-based learning instruction;andragogical model;higher education institutions;individualized online learning environment;introduction to programming language course;learning development;learning programming;learning strategy;nonmajor computer science faculty;nonmajor computer science students;pedagogical learning orientation model;pedagogical model;ragogical learning orientation model;self-directed learning phase;undergraduate students","","0","","31","","","","11-13 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different technologies have been employed in various disciplines within the educational sector. Studies have shown that technology can enhance teaching and learning experiences. Augmented Reality (AR) is a new technology with vast potentials and great pedagogical value that offers new methods for education. AR enables the overlaying of computer-generated virtual information into the real environment in real time. Thus, researchers believed that the AR has provided new opportunities for designing engaging learning environments. Although the AR may improve educational outcomes, the main factor is to understand the process of designing the AR to support learning activities. Thus, various instructional strategies such as collaborative learning, were considered when designing an AR learning environment. Collaborative learning permits students to engage with other students and the educational content at the same time, resulting in a deeper understanding and higher motivation. Because educational research concerning collaborative AR is still in its infancy, this paper intends to review the literatures concerning collaborative AR, its previous usages and its potential in educational context.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3592-5; POD:978-1-4799-3593-2; USB:978-1-4799-3591-8","10.1109/LaTiCE.2014.23","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821833","Augmented Reality;collaborative learning;education","Augmented reality;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Education;Games;Global Positioning System;Three-dimensional displays","augmented reality;computer aided instruction;groupware;teaching","AR learning environment;collaborative augmented reality;collaborative learning;computer-generated virtual information;education;globalization;innovation;teaching","","3","","35","","","","11-13 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As we can see today, most of the teaching and learning activities at all level of studies have been integrated with various forms of technologies, particularly with the Information and Communication Technology. This technology often relates to online learning, which usually involves the use of various forms of 2-dimensional applications. However, the recent times have seen many educational institutions around the globe shifting their interest towards the use of a new application for online learning, known as the virtual world. The virtual world has unique capabilities and unlike its 2-dimensional counterpart, it can generate a 3-dimensional social learning space, amplify the sense of presence and immersion of students, and support various forms of communications and interactions. Utilizing these capabilities with proper instructional strategies in conducting online learning activities can greatly enhance the online learning experience. Without a doubt, the virtual world has been considered as an important tool in modern education practice, especially for collaborative learning. To obtain a comprehensible view of this trend, this paper reviews some of the latest studies which have involved collaborative learning in virtual world. Four main topics were extracted from the reviewed studies: categories of virtual worlds, collaborative strategies used in the studies, focus of each study, and challenges of collaborative learning in virtual world.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3592-5; POD:978-1-4799-3593-2; USB:978-1-4799-3591-8","10.1109/LaTiCE.2014.18","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821828","Collaborative learning;Multi-user virtual environment;technology in education;virtual world","Avatars;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computers;Education;Second Life;Virtual environments","computer aided instruction;educational institutions;teaching;virtual reality","2-dimensional social learning space;3-dimensional social learning space;collaborative learning strategy;education world landscape;educational institutions;information and communication technology;instructional strategy;online learning activity;online learning experience;teaching;virtual world","","0","","32","","","","11-13 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Integrated with a video analysis technology and simulation, the courseware would be developed for all sport subjects in the sports science syllabus. This paper highlights the analysis phase of the study, which investigated students' problems in learning movement skills. In particular, the problems were divided into four types of construct (teaching strategy, learning materials, individual differences, external and internal factors). This paper also seeks to identify the dominant construct that might optimize the learning outcomes. Overall, 83 undergraduate students? majoring in sports science in one Malaysian university? were involved. The instruments used were questionnaire supported by some interviews. Quantitative data were analyzed using the SPSS 16 while qualitative data were analyzed through content analysis. The results from this initial study will be used to develop the courseware and facilitate the discussion on how it will be adopted in the process of preparing materials for the learning of movement skills.

National policy documents give ICT a high priority in development of the country's educational system. Curricula have been revamped to accommodate for increased role of ICT in the society and education. Also educational institutions have explicated high expectations of ICT in the process of ""massification of education."" Several research studies, however, have showed little change in the classrooms. Surveys and case studies have showed that on the way from policy documents to strategy level and implementation level, something gets missing. The lack of ICT in education is clear in primary and secondary school, which is unsurprising, given that majority of schools also lack electricity and basic facilities, including proper classrooms, tables, and books. This study sets out to investigate, using thematic interviews of secondary school teachers in Tanzania, what processes and support structures do teachers consider to be lacking in terms of ICT supported education. Informants from teacher training colleges were also involved in order to bring out viewpoints from teacher training. The results confirmed a large number of earlier results, divided to six categories: school policy, implementation and administration on the school level, access to ICT, leadership and management, school culture, and teacher training. A number of new factors were also pinpointed: teachers' lack of awareness of government policies and documentation on several levels, lack of pedagogical readiness for e-learning and blended learning, and cultural concerns. Concerning what should come first, there was a chicken-and-egg-problem: it makes little sense to invest in rapidly aging ICT infrastructure and facilities if there is no human capacity to make use of those investments, and it makes little sense to invest in human capacity if there is no technol- gical infrastructure to put quickly aging technical know-how into immediate use.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3592-5; POD:978-1-4799-3593-2; USB:978-1-4799-3591-8","10.1109/LaTiCE.2014.31","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821841","Classroom Activities;Culture;Educational Technology;ICT management;Information and Communication Technology (ICT);Tanzania;Teacher education;Teachers' expectations;Teachers' experiences","Computers;Educational institutions;Government;Internet;Interviews;Training","computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational institutions;government policies;information technology;teacher training","ICT supported education;Tanzanian secondary schools;blended learning;classroom teachers;cultural concerns;e-learning;educational curricula;educational institutions;educational system development;government policies;information and communication technology;national policy documents;pedagogical readiness;teacher training colleges","","1","","56","","","","11-13 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The scheme involves colleagues collaborating to analyse existing course and teaching quality data, develop focussed development goals for curriculum and pedagogy, plan and execute strategies to achieve these goals, and monitor their effects and success during a teaching semester. The experience presented in this paper involved a paired peer relationship between two Information and Communication Technology (ICT) lecturers (colleagues) who taught disparate courses and who had separate goals. Despite the apparent dichotomy in the courses taught and the course outcomes, their experience with a small set of goals provided useful information about employing such a scheme, especially its effectiveness despite choosing simple goals. The partners were also inspired to use the scheme again and with a stronger sense of how they might prepare their goals and pursue better implementation thereof.

The roadway map generation algorithm is composed of three steps, namely, data acquisition, data processing, and road modeling. In the data acquisition step, raw trajectory and motion data for map generation are acquired through exploration using a probe vehicle equipped with GPS and on-board sensors. The data processing step then processes the acquired trajectory and motion data into roadway geometry data. GPS trajectory data are unsuitable for direct roadway map use by autonomous cars due to signal interruptions and multipath; therefore, motion information from the on-board sensors is applied to refine the GPS trajectory data. A fixed-interval optimal smoothing theory is used for a refinement algorithm that can improve the accuracy, continuity, and reliability of road geometry data. Refined road geometry data are represented into the B-spline road model. A gradual correction algorithm is proposed to accurately represent road geometry with a reduced amount of control parameters.

It provides Internet access to poor population through infocenters located in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. AcessaSP began its operation in July 2000 and there are currently 737 infocenters fully implemented in 555 municipalities. AcessaSP digital inclusion program offers presential activities and a virtual environment dedicated to a community of more than 2.5 million registered users assisted by 1,116 monitors. Besides offering the opportunity to Internet access, the program also contribute to the social, cultural, economic and digital learning development of low income citizens in the State. Since 2003, a periodical survey called “PONLINE” is carried out in order to feed a database related to the users profile, needs, expectancies, habits and attitudes in relation to the program and the use of Internet. It is also used as a management tool for monitoring, improving and innovating the process. An important phenomenon has been observed in AcessaSP environment in the last few years: the emergence of mobility. For this study approach, mobility issue is considered from two factors: the growth and expansion of wireless connections and the broad access to mobile platforms, such as smartphones. These two characteristics are facilitating the emergence of new learning spaces and timing, which leads to the need of a wider and deeper understanding of this challenging scenario in terms of new uses and literacies. For these reasons, AcessaSP is investing in a strategy named “Acessa sem Fio” (Wireless Acessa), in which wireless connections are provided in cities with the program's infocenters. Though, there is a lack of systematic information regarding the impact of this shift from physical to virtual concept. It is still poorly known how mobility can affect the program users' appropriation and interaction with Internet. In this sense, this study aims - o offer a framework to a qualitative researcah to better understand user's habits and attitudes regarding wireless connection to Internet. Relevant outcomes are expected to be revealed in order to collaborate to a better understanding of this new scenario, mainly those ones related with the new role of infocenters in AcessaSP communities' life. The framework can also provide requirements for designing digital inclusion public policies in order to popularize and democratize the World Wide Web with wireless connection. This can be the basis of further research on public policies for wireless digital inclusion.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3216-0; POD:978-1-4799-2753-1","10.1109/CICEM.2013.6820140","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820140","AcessaSP Program;ICT uses and access;digital inclusion;infocenters;mobility","IEEE 802.11 Standards;Internet;Media;Sociology;Statistics;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;human factors;mobile computing;social aspects of automation;wireless LAN","Acessa sem Fio strategy;AcessaSP digital inclusion program;Brazil;Brazilian infocenters;Latin America;São Paulo state;Wireless Acessa strategy;World Wide Web;cultural development;digital inclusion public policy design;digital learning development;economic development;low-income citizens;management tool;mobile platforms;physical concept;presential activities;process improvement;process innovation;process monitoring;qualitative researcah;smart phones;social development;user appropriation;user attitudes;user expectancies;user habits;user interaction;user needs;user profile;virtual concept;virtual environment;wireless connections;wireless digital inclusion","","2","","26","","","","1-4 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A multidimensional approach to adopting iPads in medical education","B.

In a bid to improve digital access for students in an increasingly blended learning environment, UWS distributed over 11,000 iPads to first year students and academic staff at the start of 2013. The School of Medicine at UWS implemented several different strategies to see which would best foster student engagement and effective iPad use: (1) Student centred collaborative learning; (2) Student creation of digital content; (3) Interactive exercises during lectures, and (4) A student-centric approach to course administration As the start of the year coincides with the start of first semester in Australia, these initiatives were introduced as soon as the students commenced study in medicine. Action based research based on observation of students' behaviour and student surveys was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies. It is anticipated that these innovations offer cumulative benefits for student satisfaction beyond the advantage of each individual strategy. For example, providing regular updates of course information encourages students to retain their device at all times, which ensures widespread iPad availability for interactive exercises in lectures and small-group collaborative learning. This paper discusses the implementation of these strategies and early results from student feedback.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3216-0; POD:978-1-4799-2753-1","10.1109/CICEM.2013.6820201","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820201","Blended learning;collaborative learning;engagement;health intervention apps;iPad","Calendars;Conferences;Councils;Educational institutions;Media;Portable computers;Tablet computers","biomedical education;computer aided instruction;educational courses;groupware;human factors;medical computing;notebook computers","School of Medicine;UWS;University of Western Sydney;collaborative learning;digital access improvement;digital content creation;iPads;individual strategy;interactive exercises;learning environment;medical education;socially disadvantaged backgrounds;strategy effectiveness;student behaviour;student engagement;student feedback;student surveys;student-centric approach","","0","","6","","","","1-4 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Perspective transformation of instructors in pedagogical strategies: Achieving effective learning for new generation business students in higher education","K.

Univ., Singapore, Singapore","2013 IEEE 63rd Annual Conference International Council for Education Media (ICEM)","20140526","2013","","","1","11","In today's knowledge-based economy, education is not only an essential instrument for knowledge acquisition and self-development, but also a mandatory tool that enables students to secure a good job, gain respect in society, and develop a personal identity. The importance of having the intellectual curiosity, ability to effectively apply the acquired knowledge/skills and job expertise becomes even more crucial in the highly competitive, fast-paced workplace. As a result, students are increasingly pressured to excel and succeed in this compelling academic journey. Globalization and rapid advancements in technology have facilitated many new e-teaching tools and social media platforms to cope with changing trends in students' receptivity to information and communication styles, making it even more essential for educators to continually review the education system in order to convey knowledge to students more creatively and effectively. Consequently, the instructional approaches which influence the behavioral aspect of learning that motivate and stimulate an individual's interest in learning and effective understanding with acquiring of knowledge are essential to examine. With deeper reflection and analysis on the behavioral learning of students, instructors could better comprehend the needs and expectations which facilitate providing their students the necessary inputs. Through this instructional article, a learning framework “Perspective Transformation of instructors in Pedagogical Strategies” is proposed to facilitate more effective learning among business students. The conceptual framework proposes a shift from instructor-centric to learner-centric in the instructional roles, design of curriculum and assessments, learning culture and feedback process, by adopting five essential strategies: (1) Performing different instructional roles for varying types of instructional approaches (2) Shift in learning culture: embracing creative learning; (3) Prof- ssional soft skills training; (4) Assessments based on three fundamentals of understanding, critical thinking and application; (5) Continuous process of correspondence between instructors and students coupled with reflection in terms of formative and summative feedback; These learning approaches within the proposed framework have been applied in the classroom context at Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Business School, in Semester 2 Annual Year 12/13. They have resulted in good course assessment and examination outcomes with positive feedback from students. This framework continuously allows avenues for further exploration in terms of optimal and effective pedagogical approaches by incorporating practical solutions to calibrate and embrace the rapid changing learning needs and demands.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3216-0; POD:978-1-4799-2753-1","10.1109/CICEM.2013.6820164","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820164","Active learning;Changing learning needs;Creative teaching and Instructional approaches;New generation learners","Business;Conferences;Context;Councils;Educational institutions;Media","commerce;educational computing;educational courses;further education;management education","behavioral learning;e-teaching tools;education system;effective learning;higher education;instructional article;instructional roles;instructors;knowledge acquisition;knowledge-based economy;learning framework;new generation business students;pedagogical strategies;perspective transformation;positive feedback;professional soft skills training;social media platforms;summative feedback","","1","","29","","","","1-4 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The actual research attempted to fill the knowledge gap in cyberbullying phenomenon by focusing on factors that contribute to its activities among adolescents in Malaysia. In addition, the research seeks to understand the antecedents and the contexts and prevailing conditions that influence it, as well as the phenomenon, the coping strategies and the consequences resulting from the coping strategies. Using a grounded theory methodology, in-depth interviews were conducted on adolescents aged between 12 to 18 years from different schools in the state of Perlis. The data were analyzed using NVivo 10 by methodically coding and categorizing the data in open, axial and selective coding to arrive at a model development. A paradigm model will be obtained based on informants' individual comments and experiences which uniquely contribute to the body of knowledge on cyberbullying phenomenon in Malaysia. The involved elements derived from the model are; the antecedents of cyberbullying; the phenomenon; the coping strategies by informants and the consequences resulting from these strategies. The significance of this study lies in its attempt to provide a working framework for reducing adolescents' technology abuse that will eventually lead to cyberbullying and to find solutions for adolescents to tackle cyberbullying problems if it ever happened. This study is hoped to benefit all the parties: adolescents, parents, teachers, and other stakeholders to minimize adolescents' cyberbullying phenomenon. At a time when most adolescents are exposed to cyber bullying around the world, this research is both timely and necessary.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3216-0; POD:978-1-4799-2753-1","10.1109/CICEM.2013.6820146","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820146","Cyberbullying;Facebook;Grounded theory;Paradigm model","Conferences;Councils;Educational institutions;Encoding;Interviews;Media;Probes","behavioural sciences computing;computer crime;data analysis","Malaysia;NVivo 10;Perlis;adolescents;coping strategies;cyberbullying activities;cyberbullying phenomenon;data categorization;data coding;emergence factors;emergence themes;grounded theory methodology;model development","","0","","26","","","","1-4 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Shift-Based Density Estimation for Pareto-Based Algorithms in Many-Objective Optimization","M. Li; S. Yang; X. Liu","Department of Information Systems and Computing, Brunel University, Uxbridge, Middlesex, U.K.","IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","20140526","2014","18","3","348","365","It is commonly accepted that Pareto-based evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms encounter difficulties in dealing with many-objective problems. In these algorithms, the ineffectiveness of the Pareto dominance relation for a high-dimensional space leads diversity maintenance mechanisms to play the leading role during the evolutionary process, while the preference of diversity maintenance mechanisms for individuals in sparse regions results in the final solutions distributed widely over the objective space but distant from the desired Pareto front. Intuitively, there are two ways to address this problem: 1) modifying the Pareto dominance relation and 2) modifying the diversity maintenance mechanism in the algorithm. In this paper, we focus on the latter and propose a shift-based density estimation (SDE) strategy. The aim of our study is to develop a general modification of density estimation in order to make Pareto-based algorithms suitable for many-objective optimization. In contrast to traditional density estimation that only involves the distribution of individuals in the population, SDE covers both the distribution and convergence information of individuals. The application of SDE in three popular Pareto-based algorithms demonstrates its usefulness in handling many-objective problems. Moreover, an extensive comparison with five state-of-the-art EMO algorithms reveals its competitiveness in balancing convergence and diversity of solutions. These findings not only show that SDE is a good alternative to tackle many-objective problems, but also present a general extension of Pareto-based algorithms in many-objective optimization.","1089-778X;1089778X","","10.1109/TEVC.2013.2262178","EPSRC Industrial Case; EU FP7-Health; Education Department and Qinglan Engineering of Jiangsu Province, China; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council of U.K.; National Natural Science Foundation of China (Major International Joint Research Project); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6516892","Convergence;Evolutionary multiobjective optimization;convergence;diversity;evolutionary multiobjective optimization;many-objective optimization;manyobjective optimization;shift-based density estimation","","Pareto optimisation;evolutionary computation","EMO algorithms;Pareto dominance relation;Pareto front;Pareto-based evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm;SDE strategy;diversity maintenance mechanisms;high-dimensional space;many-objective optimization;shift-based density estimation;sparse regions","","57","","84","","","20130516","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The theoretic stability analysis for a closed-loop system with an event detector is adequately expressed. The two-degree-of-freedom internal-model-control feedback controller and the dynamic feedforward controller, both of which are triggered by the same event detection logic, are designed to guarantee local performance. In addition, a gain-scheduling measure is adopted to combine local controllers to ensure the overall performance under all power levels. Comparing case studies shows that the proposed control strategy exhibits good capability to manage the utilization of a process control unit and the control action, with no deterioration in the control performance.","0278-0046;02780046","","10.1109/TIE.2014.2301735","Applied Basic Research Programs of Suzhou; Beijing Education Committee Cooperation Building Foundation Project; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6718050","Event-driven control;Nuclear steam generator;event-driven control;nuclear steam generator;stability analysis;water level control","Event detection;Feedforward neural networks;Generators;Inductors;Level control;Power generation;Stability analysis","actuators;closed loop systems;feedback;feedforward;level control;nuclear power stations;stability;steam power stations","actuators;closed-loop system;dynamic feedforward controller;event detection logic;event detector;event-driven control methodology;event-driven-based water level control;gain-scheduling measure;internal-model-control feedback controller;nuclear power exploitation;nuclear power unit;nuclear power utilization;nuclear steam generators;pressurized water reactor;process control unit;service life;steam-generator water level control strategy;theoretic stability analysis","","2","","33","","","20140121","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Social networks consist of the basic building blocks called as the communities within which the social interactions are intensive, but between which they are very weak. Everyone could observe that the spread of infectious disease inside communities often has the ability to cross countries borders and spread rapidly. With the widespread of diseases causing major public health problem, we argue that human mobility patterns not only influence the spreading, but are also useful for preventing and creating awareness of the diseases. In this paper, we present new opportunities offered by the field of mobile social networks for understanding the spread of infectious diseases. For this purpose we propose two models namely MABM (Mobile Agent Based Model) and SDC (Spread Discovery Control) model to understand the spread of communicable diseases between different regions. The proposed SDC model is used to comprehend the spread of diseases by extracting the community structures and the analysis of mobility pattern of each agent (user) within the mobile network. Moreover, the understanding of spread details helps us to propose the control strategy to avoid the spread of the epidemic disease on the specific region. To realize our proposed models in a better way, we have modeled one such communicable disease usually spreading every year in West African region.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-2240-9","10.1145/2492517.2492612","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785681","Community Mining;Influential user;MABM;SDC;Social Networks","Analytical models;Communities;Conferences;Diseases;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Social network services","diseases;epidemics;health care;medical computing;mobile agents;mobile computing;social networking (online)","MABM;SDC;communicable diseases;community structure extraction;disease awareness;education;epidemics control;epidemics modeling;human mobility patterns;infectious disease;mobile agent based model;mobile agent-based approach;mobile phones;mobile social networks;mobility pattern analysis;public health problem;social interactions;spread discovery control model","","1","","14","","","","25-28 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a reliable energy-efficient topology control algorithm in wireless sensor networks is proposed. The proposed algorithm considers the residual energy and number of neighbors of each node for cluster formation, which is critical for well-balanced energy dissipation of the network. Knowledge-based inference approach is employed to select cluster head. Finally, reliable cluster heads are selected that maintain connectivity and coverage with respect to time. The algorithm not only balances the energy load of each node but also provides global reliability for the whole network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively prolong the network lifetime and reduces the energy consumption.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3880-3; POD:978-1-4799-3881-0","10.1109/AIMOC.2014.6785533","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785533","Clustering;Topology Control;Wireless Sensor Networks","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Network topology;Nickel;Protocols;Topology;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network topology;wireless sensor networks","cluster formation;cluster head;energy conservation;energy dissipation;energy efficient topology building algorithm;global reliability;knowledge-based inference approach;residual energy;topology control;wireless sensor networks","","0","","15","","","","Feb. 27 2014-March 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data was gathered from three student cohorts in the academic years 2010 through 2012. Students within the cohorts were sampled from a range of academic disciplines (n=1074), and were diverse in their academic backgrounds and abilities. Metrics used included data that are typically available to colleges such as age, gender and prior academic performance. The study also considered psychometric indicators that can be assessed in the early stages after enrolment, specifically, personality, motivation and learning strategies. Six classification algorithms were considered. Model accuracy was assessed using cross validation and was compared to outcomes when models were applied to a subsequent academic year. It was found that mature students were more complex to model than younger students. Furthermore, 10-fold cross validation accurately estimated model performance when modeling younger students only, but over-estimated model accuracy when modeling mature students.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-2571-1; Electronic:978-1-4799-2572-8; POD:978-1-4799-2573-5","10.1109/IAdCC.2014.6779384","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779384","academic performance;classification;cross validation;educational data mining;learning styles;model evaluation;motivation;personality;self-regulated learning","Accuracy;Correlation;Data models;Educational institutions;Predictive models;Support vector machines","data mining;educational administrative data processing;educational courses;educational institutions;pattern classification;psychometric testing","10-fold cross validation;academic abilities;academic backgrounds;academic disciplines;classification models;college student identification;data gathering;learner progression prediction;mature students;model performance estimation;psychometric indicators;student academic performance;student age;student cohorts;student enrolment;student gender;student learning strategy;student motivation strategy;student personality strategy;tertiary education;younger students","","2","","46","","","","21-22 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The result shows that M should be more than the product of the number of users and the number of antennas at each user. Based on the optimal number, we propose a convenient data stream allocation strategy aiming to improve the system sum rate, meanwhile maintaining the number of simultaneously served users.

The rapid developments and popularity of handheld devices such as smart phones and tablet PCs using wireless networks and mobile internet have marked new developments in higher education, introducing the so-called mobile learning (m-learning). This means that university students can have access to their studies related content, anytime, anywhere in a personalised manner, this is what renders m-learning so popular and fashionable among university students globally.

"Art museums, mobile media and education: A new way to explain art?","V. L. Benito","Sch. of Educ., Univ. of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain","2013 Digital Heritage International Congress (DigitalHeritage)","20140220","2013","1","","767","767","Summary form only given. The content of this paper forms part of a wider research on the educational possibilities of mobile media in art museums. Currently, museums are changing their relationship with the public based on the availability of Web 2.0 and new information and communication technologies, particularly the mobile media, involving the use of tablets and smartphones. New ways of communication have been developed by museums and users are invited to contribute to museum contents with their own contributions as well as museums reach out to new audiences through the new media. However, if we focus on a systematic analysis of mobile apps for museums, one of the more rapidly expanding mobile resources, we would like to determine whether educational function is one of the aims of these resources. Moreover, we would also like to find out whether the learning strategies developed to explain art are different than the strategies employed in art museums so far. These kinds of mobile resources provide a wide range of educational strategies not always used to engage art museums audiences. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to reveal the results of the analysis of mobile Apps designed by Art Museums in the Spanish context in order to determine whether they have become a valuable educational resource and to explore what type of learning strategies they have been developed through these technologies to explain art to a wider audience. Firstly, five Apps have been analyzed for this paper: Guggenheim Museum App, the Picasso Museum of Barcelona App, Reina Sofía Museum App, Thyssen Museum App Prado Museum App. The criteria to select this sample were on one hand, the Apps are about the collection and permanent exhibition of the museums and on the other hand, the Apps must be mobile applications not mobile audioguide or Web mobile. Secondly, the Apps have been analyzed by an analysis sheet designed previously for the research. This analysis sheet has two sections. Th- first one is a descriptive analysis which includes different categories such as country, year publication, category of Art Museum, devices (Smartphones, Tablets or both). Also whether Internet connection is needed, whether the App is free or not and which OS is used (iOS, Android or both). The descriptive analysis also include the context of use related to the museum visit (before, during or independent of the visit), the type of application as well as the target audience. The second section of the analysis sheet evaluates the educational factor of the applications according to several categories. In this case, the categories are the type of content, the type of learning strategies, aims, and resources like images, videos, social media, AR, etc. The outcomes of the descriptive analysis have been analyzed using descriptive statistics technics. Otherwise, the second section, educational factor, is not only a descriptive analysis, but an assessment analysis to determinate whether the Apps could be a valuable educational resource. To assess the educational factor each item of the categories has been coded with a number (1= low, 2= medium and 3= high). As result of this codification process there are five categories to evaluate the educational factor: (1= low, between 1 and 2= medium-low, 2= medium, between 2 and 3= medium-high, 3=high). According to the assessment of the educational factor of the five Mobile Apps selected for this paper, the outcomes reveal that the educational factor are low in the case of Prado Museum App, medium-low in the case of Guggenheim Museum App, the Picasso Museum of Barcelona App, Reina Sofía Museum App. And Thyssen Museum App is the unique App whose educational factor is medium-high. To conclude, it is possible to state that the answer to the title, Art Museums, Mobile Media: a new way to explain art?, would be negative in the case of the Apps of theses Spanish Art Museums. There is a change in the medium but not in the message.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3170-5; POD:978-1-4799-3171-2; USB:978-1-4799-3169-9","10.1109/DigitalHeritage.2013.6743840","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6743840","Art Museums;Digital Curation;Education;Mobile Apps","","Internet;art;computer aided instruction;mobile computing;museums","Guggenheim Museum App;Internet connection;Picasso Museum of Barcelona App;Prado Museum App;Reina Sofía Museum App;Spanish art museums;Thyssen Museum App;Web 2.0;art museum audiences;assessment analysis;descriptive analysis;descriptive statistics;educational factor;educational resource;educational strategies;information and communication technologies;learning strategies;mobile Apps;mobile applications;mobile media;mobile resources;museum visit;smartphones;tablets","","0","","","","","","Oct. 28 2013-Nov. 1 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of these virtual learning environments (VLEs) are centred on information transmission through improved communication, delivery and access to structured content and learning resources without much emphasis on user-specific content and pedagogical framework peculiar to the teaching and learning needs of the local HEI. The major concern has been the lack of flexibility of these VLEs in adapting to the existing variety of teaching and learning methods employed by various HEIs. To address this challenge, we have proposed a user-specific integrated approach for the design of knowledge-based e-learning systems. Using this approach, we developed a framework for the faculty of computing, Univeristi of Teknologi Malaysia (UTM).

The authors engage three phases to gain the objective of this study. These phases include problem definition, define objectives of a solution, and framework development. The proposed framework provides a sequential and rigorous approach to effectively transforming HEIs towards sustainable campus. However, there is a need of future works to validate and assess the applicability of the framework in HEIs.","2324-8149;23248149","Electronic:978-1-4799-2487-5; POD:978-1-4799-2488-2","10.1109/ICRIIS.2013.6716717","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6716717","alignment;higher education institution;information system;strategy;sustainability","Education;Information systems;Monitoring;Organizations;Planning;Technological innovation","educational computing;further education;information systems;sustainable development","HEIs;alignment process;higher education institutions;information system strategy;sustainability strategy;sustainability transformation framework;sustainable campus","","2","","34","","","","27-28 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To bridge this gap between mathematical theory and practice, we have designed a course in mathematical modelling and problem solving at Chalmers University of Technology. The main purpose of the present study is to investigate and better understand what challenges engineering students experience when dealing with mathematical modelling problems and what strategies they use to overcome those challenges. Data was collected through semistructured interviews with six students early in the course and the interviews were based on two problems that the students had solved during the course. The data was analysed using basic strategies for qualitative analysis and led to the identification of two central challenges experienced by the students as well as several strategies for overcoming them. The first challenge is that students are not fully aware of the importance of understanding the problem, and the second is that students get stuck because they do not sufficiently consider alternatives in a non-linear solution process. While these issues have little to do with mathematical modelling as such, the modelling problems given clearly reveal these shortcomings, which we see as lacking problem solving skills. Our findings confirm the importance of teaching mathematical modelling and problem solving, and in a more general setting we see cognitive apprenticeship as a promising framework for teaching and learning in engineering education.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1221-6; POD:978-1-4799-1222-3; USB:978-1-4799-1220-9","10.1109/CISPEE.2013.6701981","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6701981","Mathematical modelling;cognitive apprenticeship;problem solving","Educational institutions;Engineering students;Interviews;Mathematical model;Problem-solving","computer aided instruction;educational courses;engineering education;mathematics computing","cognitive apprenticeship;engineering education;engineering student;introductory mathematics courses;mathematical modelling;problem solving;teaching","","0","","24","","","","Oct. 31 2013-Nov. 1 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The problem was based on the assumptions that the campaigns strategy for the national wetlands policy awareness in Uganda has for along time been less successful because it did not focus on the right media strategy with respect to the target audience participation and audience demographic characteristics. There was no gender barrier to information uptake. Low income and education levels were barriers to community access to wetlands information. The study found that the socio-economic backgrounds of the audiences were identical in their access to public information and the types of media used in the campaigns.

The first one allows the computation of the motor electromagnetic behavior using a finite element model, while the second one allows the dynamic simulation of the control and feeding converter. The interacting use of these tools allows a detailed prediction of the motor transient behavior under a given control strategy and drive scheme. As test case a permanent magnet synchronous motor for biomedical application is considered, driven by field-oriented control. The co-simulation approach is at first compared with the (usual) lumped parameter modeling simulation and then verified by experiments. The results demonstrate that the co-simulation procedure allows taking into account not negligible phenomena, such as cogging and torque ripple, usually not considered in similar studies. Hence, co-simulation analysis represents a significant step for the integrate design of the motor and control, as well as a meaningful tool for electrical drives education.","1553-572X;1553572X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0224-8; POD:978-1-4799-0225-5; USB:978-1-4799-0223-1","10.1109/IECON.2013.6700264","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6700264","AC motors;PI control;brushless motors;circuit simulation;finite element methods;permanent magnet motors;power systems simulation","Analytical models;Brushless motors;Computational modeling;Finite element analysis;Permanent magnet motors;Synchronous motors;Torque","biomedical equipment;computational electromagnetics;control engineering computing;finite element analysis;machine vector control;permanent magnet motors;power system simulation;software tools;synchronous motor drives;transient analysis","Cedrat Flux;PM synchronous motor drives;Portunus;biomedical application;control strategy;dynamic simulation;electric motor drives;electrical drives education;embedded finite element motor modeling;feeding converter;field oriented control;finite element model cosimulation;motor electromagnetic behavior computation;motor transient behavior prediction;permanent magnet synchronous motor;software tools;transient analysis;transient simulation tools","","3","","12","","","","10-13 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite numerous studies of effective approaches to integrating communication into disciplinary courses, few engineering courses apply those approaches. To address this gap, we have undertaken a multi-year mixed methods study to explore faculty and student beliefs about communication. Faculty beliefs have been reported elsewhere; this paper focuses on student beliefs. We analyzed five focus groups conducted with engineering students at partner schools. The focus groups sought to uncover students' beliefs about where and how they learned communication skills within their engineering education. Focus groups were recorded and transcribed verbatim, then coded using standard open-coding procedures. The findings indicate that while students do have opportunities to practice communication in engineering courses, they may not always have optimal opportunities to learn communication in those courses. Most notably, students desired more examples and direct instruction for communication skills, including not only samples of “good” documents but also explanations about why they were good. Identifying pedagogical gaps between faculty practice and student experiences can help us develop targeted strategies to help creatively integrate these critical skills into an already packed engineering curriculum.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4673-5261-1; POD:978-1-4673-5259-8; USB:978-1-4673-5260-4","10.1109/FIE.2013.6684827","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6684827","communication;situated learning;student beliefs","Abstracts;Communities;Educational institutions;Employment;Engineering education","educational computing;engineering education;natural language processing","communication skills learning;engineering education;engineering students;focus groups;open-coding procedures;student beliefs","","2","","16","","","","23-26 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mathematics assessment tools still focus solely on this procedural side of understanding mathematics instead of the equally important conceptual aspect of learning mathematics. Given that math is an active process that encourages higher-order thinking and problem solving, an assessment focusing on the growth of conceptual understanding is required. The proposed research focuses on the development of a tool that will be used to assess current U.S. calculus students' ability to apply their conceptual understanding of a mathematic concept to scientific phenomena through modeling.

Flipping the classroom switches when assignments (e.g. homework) and knowledge transfer (e.g. lecture) occur.

The majority of the courses that have undergone this change use applied learning strategies and include a significant “learning-by-doing” component. The research in this area is skewed towards such courses and in general there are many considerations that educators ought to account for if they were to move to this form of teaching. Introductory courses in computer programming can appear to have all the elements needed to move to a flipped environment; however, initial observations from our research identify possible pitfalls with the assumption.

Although much progress has been made, challenges remain, especially when the 3D structures of target proteins are not available or no homology templates can be found in the library, where the template-based methods are hard to be applied. In this paper, we report a new ligand-specific template-free predictor called TargetS for targeting protein-ligand binding sites from primary sequences. TargetS first predicts the binding residues along the sequence with ligand-specific strategy and then further identifies the binding sites from the predicted binding residues through a recursive spatial clustering algorithm. Protein evolutionary information, predicted protein secondary structure, and ligand-specific binding propensities of residues are combined to construct discriminative features; an improved AdaBoost classifier ensemble scheme based on random undersampling is proposed to deal with the serious imbalance problem between positive (binding) and negative (nonbinding) samples. Experimental results demonstrate that TargetS achieves high performances and outperforms many existing predictors.

This paper describes the use of a framework proposed by Crismond and Adams in order to create pedagogical activities for the CS1 course. We propose to extend that framework with competences oriented activities. We present a detailed description of each activity. Hypothetically, we propose that including this kind of activities helps to obtain better results. An initial experimentation with low number of students was done in 2012. Results show that the inclusion of those activities seems to be helpful for students taking the course for the first time.

While mobile security threats are a concern and mobile technologies' potential to boost productivity in Higher education increases, little has been done to assess the impact of mobile security risks against utilization of hand-held technologies for learning. This paper argues that mobile security risks have a significant impact on mobile learning adoption. Drawing on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) factors that promote Mobile Instant Messaging (MIM) for learning adoption will be examined by exploring the pedagogical application of WhatsApp mobile software.

In order to derive key factors influencing users' acceptance of Pad Phones, the second generation Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) will be introduced as the theoretic framework. Based on opinions being derived from lead users, the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) based Network Process (DNP) will be introduced for constructing the influence s between the factors in UTAUT2; and then, weights being associated with the factors can be derived accordingly. Based on the empirical study results, the social influence plays the dominant role in facilitating conditions. The habit and hedonic motivation are essential factors influencing customers' acceptances of Pad Phones.

Learning has matured from a tethered delivery strategy offered through mail into a delivery strategy mediated by electronic devices (E-Learning), and now we witness a robust mobile learning strategy delivered wirelessly to students in a smart classroom using mobile tablets. In this work, we propose an M-learning approach that rests on the mobile tablet representing a crucial tool to deliver multimedia knowledge in a smart environment.

Using advanced ICT for accomplishing military tasks in advanced countries is a common, but that matter is not the same in military society in developing countries such as Indonesia. Therefore there is a need to define the proper characteristics for a military service so that it can be declared as Smart Military Society. On the other hand, the characteristics of Smart Society itself are not unified yet. In this paper, the characteristics of Smart Military Society are proposed by adopting, in some respects, a method used to score Smart City. Because of its unique nature and tasks, one new characteristic called Smart Defense which consists of four factors namely intelligence, weapon system, decision-making cycle, and interoperability, is added. Based on the comprehensive assessment, it is proposed seven characteristics with 26 factors that can be used to score and rank military services, and show if they are eligible to be called as Smart Military Society.

But, these systems are faced with a big security challenge. In fact, they are exposed to malicious intrusions, identity usurpation and data falsification. Those security problems are a barrier for electronic collaboration, that's why Trust management must be established to insure and maintain cooperation between distributed nodes. In this paper, we propose a model that can be applicable for any collaborative platform. It is based on a multi level architecture: authentication, analysis, security and monitoring levels. Each level is managed by agents. Each access to the collaborative platform must be controlled by an authentication agent. Analysis agent must identify collaboration type and estimate trust level. Security agents decide then if collaboration can take place. Decisions are taken following a Case Based Reasoning method.

In this new paradigm, efficient data transmission between the cloud and mobile devices becomes essential. This, however, is highly unreliable and unpredictable due to several uncontrollable factors, particularly the instability and intermittency of wireless connections, fluctuation of communication bandwidth, and user mobility. Consequently, this puts a heavy burden on the energy consumption of mobile devices. Confirmed by our experiments, significantly more energy is consumed during “bad” connectivity. Inspired by the feasibility to schedule data transmissions for prefetching-friendly or delay-tolerant applications, in this paper, we present eTime, a novel Energy-efficient data Transmission strategy between cloud and Mobile dEvices, based on Lyapunov optimization. It aggressively and adaptively seizes the timing of good connectivity to prefetch frequently used data while deferring delay-tolerant data in bad connectivity. To cope with the randomness and unpredictability of wireless connectivity, eTime only relies on the current status information to make a global energy-delay tradeoff decision. Our evaluations from both trace-driven simulation and realworld implementation show that eTime can be applied to various popular applications while achieving 20%-35% energy saving.","0743-166X;0743166X","Electronic:978-1-4673-5946-7; POD:978-1-4673-5944-3","10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6566762","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6566762","","Bandwidth;Data communication;Energy consumption;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Mobile communication;Smart phones","cloud computing;delay tolerant networks;energy conservation;mobile computing;optimisation;radio networks","Lyapunov optimization;bad connectivity;communication bandwidth;computing paradigm;data transmissions;delay-tolerant applications;delay-tolerant data;eTime;energy consumption;energy-efficient data transmission strategy;energy-efficient transmission;frequently used data;global energy-delay tradeoff decision;mobile cloud computing;realworld implementation;resource-constrained mobile devices;status information;trace-driven simulation;user mobility;wireless connections;wireless connectivity","","40","","12","","","","14-19 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve predictable network performance for rented virtual machines (VMs), cloud providers should guarantee minimum bandwidth for VMs or allocate the network bandwidth in a fairness fashion at VM-level. At the same time, the network should be efficiently utilized in order to maximize cloud providers' revenue. In this paper, we model the bandwidth sharing problem as a Nash bargaining game, and propose the allocation principles by defining a tunable base bandwidth for each VM. Specifically, we guarantee bandwidth for those VMs with lower network rates than their base bandwidth, while maintaining fairness among other VMs with higher network rates than their base bandwidth. Based on rigorous cooperative game-theoretic approaches, we design a distributed algorithm to achieve efficient and fair bandwidth allocation corresponding to the Nash bargaining solution (NBS). With simulations under typical scenarios, we show that our strategy can meet the two desirable requirements towards predictable performance for tenants as well as high utilization for providers. And by tuning the base bandwidth, our solution can enable cloud providers to flexibly balance the tradeoff between minimum guarantees and fair sharing of datacenter networks.","0743-166X;0743166X","Electronic:978-1-4673-5946-7; POD:978-1-4673-5944-3","10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6567016","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567016","","Bandwidth;Bismuth;Channel allocation;Games;NIST;Resource management;Servers","bandwidth allocation;cloud computing;computer centres;game theory;virtual machines","IaaS datacenters;Nash bargaining game;Nash bargaining solution;VM-level;bandwidth sharing problem;cloud providers;cooperative game based allocation;cooperative game-theoretic approaches;data center networks;distributed algorithm;fair bandwidth allocation;fairness fashion;network bandwidth;network performance;network rates;rented virtual machines;tunable base bandwidth","","23","","15","","","","14-19 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Crucial to successful mastery is the development of discipline specific cognitive and metacognitive skills, including self-regulation. We can assist our students in the process of reflection and self-regulation by identifying and articulating successful self-regulated learning strategies for specific discipline contexts. However, in order to do so, we must develop an understanding of those discipline specific strategies that can be successful and readily adopted by students, and ways of understanding and articulating successful mental models. In this paper, we explore a Neo-Piagetian analysis of students' reflections upon their software development processes, enabling us to identify mental models for software development. We adopt a case study approach, identifying key examples of pre-operational behaviours that rely upon self-regulated learning strategies in place of articulated mental models, through to formal operational behaviours exhibiting complex, multi-relationship models of software development and design activities. Our study provides support for pedagogy for sharing of mental models and strategies amongst students, and guiding students by explicitly modelling the software development process.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4960-6; POD:978-1-4673-5627-5","10.1109/LaTiCE.2013.23","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6542236","Mental Models;Metacognition;Neo-Piaget;Software Development Processes","Cognition;Cognitive science;Concrete;Context;Encoding;Programming;Software","cognition;computer science education;educational courses;software engineering","ICT student;Neo-Piagetian reasoning form;articulated mental model;cognitive skill;information and communication technology;mental model;mental strategy;metacognitive skill;pedagogy;programming skill;self-regulated learning strategy;software design;software development process construction","","1","","36","","","","21-24 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper gives a short overview over common sensorless position estimation strategies and shows a MATLAB/Simulink simulation for the sensorless methods Flux Estimation and Sliding Mode Observer. Furthermore, a vector control on a PMSG including a sliding mode observer model for sensorless rotor position estimation is implemented on a TI Concerto processor (Cortex M3 and C28x DSP dualcore) for a frequency inverter for micro hydro power generation. A new approach is the utilization of a dualcore processor in this application: the Cortex M3 runs communication and general system tasks in a micro hydro power generation site, whereas the C28x DSP focuses on the generator control task.

Accordingly, universities will need to change their curriculums and educational environments in order to teach advanced information and communication technology to students. Educational organizations such as universities need to provide an educational cloud for use by students. We are constructing a private educational cloud based on the Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud. The most important feature of our cloud is super-saturation, which is defined as allocating more logical resources than the available physical resources. A supersaturated cloud can execute more than 10 times the number of instances than a conventional cloud. In order to maximize the performance of a supersaturated cloud, tasks must continuously be provided to the cloud. However, the demand on grids has been reduced because of energy saving. Thus, the grid and cloud are complementary technologies in that the cloud consumes tasks produced by the grid. In this paper, we propose a method for constructing a Grid on Cloud to solve this issue. We compare two methods, the single large instance strategy (SLIS) and multiple small instance strategy. We conclude that the SLIS based instance grid method is the best if the system load is shared by all instances.","1550-445X;1550445X","Electronic:978-0-7695-4953-8; POD:978-1-4673-5550-6","10.1109/AINA.2013.71","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6531758","cloud computing;educational cloud;grid","Business;Cloud computing;Clouds;Educational institutions;Memory management;Servers","cloud computing;computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;grid computing;resource allocation;software performance evaluation;teaching","SLIS based instance grid method;Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud;advanced information and communication technology;cloud computing;cloud skills;curriculums;educational environments;energy saving;logical resource allocation;multiple small instance strategy;physical resources;private educational cloud;single large instance strategy;supersaturated cloud performance;system load;teaching","","2","","17","","","","25-28 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The harsh operational uncertainties are attributed for possible imperfect sensor calibration, unknown a priori image statistics and carrier trajectory deviations peculiar to all conventional low resolution side looking radar sensors. To achieve a high-resolution RS image recovery, we propose to aggregate the RED strategy with the variational analysis (VA) inspired ℓ<sub>2</sub>-ℓ<sub>1</sub> metrics structured regularization. The latter employs the prior model about the piecewise sparseness of the scene reflectivity gradient maps that alleviates the overall imaging inverse problem ill-posedness. The fused RED-VA structured sensing method implemented in an efficient iterative computing mode outperforms the most prominent competing radar imaging technique that do not aggregate the RED with the ℓ<sub>2</sub>-ℓ<sub>1</sub> metrically structured VA in the considered harsh RS operational scenarios as verified in the reported numerical simulations.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6155-2; POD:978-1-4673-6156-9","10.1109/CONIELECOMP.2013.6525790","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6525790","enhanced radar imaging;remote sensing;robust experiment design regularization;variational analysis","Image resolution;Imaging;Measurement;Radar imaging;Synthetic aperture radar;TV","design of experiments;geophysical image processing;gradient methods;image resolution;iterative methods;radar imaging;remote sensing","RED descriptive spatial spectral estimation approach;RED-VA structured sensing method;RS operational scenarios;carrier trajectory deviations;harsh operational uncertainties;high-resolution RS image recovery;image statistics;imaging inverse problem ill-posedness;iterative computing mode;low resolution side;metrically structured experiment design regularization approach;numerical simulations;prominent high-resolution recovery;radar imaging;radar sensors;remote sensing scenarios;robust experiment design descriptive spatial spectral estimation approach;scene reflectivity gradient maps;sensor calibration;spatial reflectivity maps;variational analysis","","0","","14","","","","11-13 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we will discuss the functionalities of some state of art online learning platforms. We will identify some shortcomings of current e-learning platforms. We also present the architecture of cloud based active and interactive learning platforms that supports problem based learning (PBL) and active learning strategies.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5624-4; POD:978-1-4673-5622-0","10.1109/ISECon.2013.6525193","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6525193","OCW;Online Active Learning;cloud computing;problem based learning (PBL)","Collaboration;Collaborative work;Conferences;Educational institutions;Electronic learning;Internet","","","","0","","25","","","","9-9 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, information security topics are challenging to teach in traditional computer laboratories mainly due to restrictive information technology policies. In recent decades, virtual computing has become a promising solution to address the challenges of providing students with hands-on learning experiences in information security. While the literature mainly focuses on technical aspects of virtual computer laboratories and provides ample examples about how they can be used in information security courses, there is a lack of pedagogical studies. We introduce a framework based on Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle to design activities for virtual computer laboratories. We provide empirical evidence that if virtual computer activities are designed and conducted according to this framework, student learning can be enhanced even further.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5624-4; POD:978-1-4673-5622-0","10.1109/ISECon.2013.6525215","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6525215","Hands on Experimentation;Information Security;Kolb Experiential Learning;Virtual Computer Laboratory","Abstracts;Computers;Conferences;Education;Information security;Laboratories","computer aided instruction;groupware;information technology;security of data;virtual reality","Kolb experiential learning cycle;collaborative virtual computer laboratory;hands-on activities;information security;information technology;student learning","","1","","14","","","","9-9 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A number of such approaches have been developed to teach argumentation skills in domains as diverse as science, the Law, and ethics. Yet, imbuing educational software with effective intelligent tutoring functions requires considerable time and effort. We present a highly configurable software framework, “Configurable Argumentation Support Engine” (CASE), designed to reduce effort and development costs considerably when building tutorial agents for graphical argumentation learning systems. CASE detects pedagogically relevant patterns in argument diagrams and provides feedback and hints in response. A wide variety of patterns are supported, including ones sensitive to students' understanding of the domain, problem-solving processes, and collaboration processes. Teachers and researchers can configure the behavior of tutorial agents on three levels: patterns, tutorial actions, and tutorial strategies. The paper discusses design concerns, the architecture, and the configuration mechanisms of CASE. As a proof of concept, four showcases are presented each showing different aspects of CASE and thus demonstrating the flexibility and breadth of applicability of the CASE approach in supporting single user and collaborative scenarios across different argumentation domains.","1939-1382;19391382","","10.1109/TLT.2013.3","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6409347","Analytical models;Collaboration;Collaborative learning tools;Computer aided software engineering;Law;Peer to peer computing;Tutorials;authoring tools;intelligent tutoring systems","Analytical models;Collaboration;Computer aided software engineering;Law;Peer to peer computing;Tutorials","courseware;groupware;intelligent tutoring systems;teaching","CASE;argumentation skill teaching;collaboration process;configurable argumentation support engine;configurable software framework;educational software;ethics;graphical argumentation learning system;intelligent tutoring function;law;problem-solving process;science;student learning;student problem solving","","2","","31","","","20130110","April-June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Organizations use various Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications to support their functions in planning, manufacturing, sales, marketing, customer relationships, finance, human resource management, supply chain and logistics, e-business and other similar functions. This leads to handling of very large datasets which may be stored in distributed and discrete manner. These organizations make decisions based on the reports generated from such databases. Although, organizations maintain an ERP system that automates the business processes and generate reports, the report may still have issues with its completeness. This paper attempts to discuss and address the following areas of concerns: a) Localization invariably results in challenges during report generation and data consolidation. b) The scope of the customized reports is limited to the requirement specified by the organization at a point in time of ERP implementation, and the organization may have to entail additional efforts (efforts involve additional costs) to ensure the reports remain current. c) During data migration, manual data mapping and translation for database is involved to a greater extent. This paper recommends an approach that could be adopted by the ERP application vendors to handle the variations in data with the use of recent technologies and thus, attempt to address the above issues by offering field level data transliteration as an Out of the box feature (OOTB).","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1344-5; POD:978-1-4673-1342-1","10.1109/ICCIC.2012.6510208","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6510208","Data Management;ERP Applications;GUI;Multi-lingual;Out of the box;Reports;Transliteration;localization","","data handling;database management systems;enterprise resource planning","customer relationship function;data management;data mapping;data migration;data transliteration;database translation;e-business function;enterprise resource planning;finance function;human resource management function;logistics function;manufacturing function;marketing function;multilingual ERP application;planning function;sales function;supply chain function","","0","","8","","","","18-20 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, it obliges students to be physically present in the laboratory to complete their experiments. The lab instructor is also present to help them with their needs or to answer their specific questions related to the experiments. With the evolution of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and electronic circuit board technologies, further possibilities even include to bring the laboratory at home (Lab@home).

Available miniature kits include basic electronics for the generation and processing of various types of signals. The personal computer coupled with the kit, acts as a set of signal injecting and measuring devices. Pedagogical strategies to encourage team collaborative work, ensuring simultaneous information exchanges between the students themselves and with the laboratory instructor can be elaborated specifically for this innovative setup. This recent approach can be used to help enforce the knowledge and competence of the students, allowing them to develop their autonomy, their creativity and thus develop their ability to innovate.

By working with teachers on how to assimilate programming and computational thinking into their classrooms we will effectively reach a large population of students in areas where computer science classes are not available. In this paper, we outline the current state of the project and some of the data we have collected.

"Work in progress: A constructivist didactic methodology for a humanoid robotics workshop","A. Miranda; Y. Bolea; A. Grau; A. Sanfeliu","Automatic Control Dept, Technical University of Catalonia UPC, Barcelona, Spain","2012 Frontiers in Education Conference Proceedings","20130218","2012","","","1","3","This paper presents a constructivist methodology oriented to training Robotics in its wide sense, and its implementation in higher education. A humanoid robotics workshop is included as a part of the curriculum of `Industrial Robotics' in the Industrial Engineering. This workshop covers one third of the laboratory practices of this subject. A constructivist view for learning is adopted, whereby robotic technologies are not seen as mere tools, but rather as potential vehicles of new ways of thinking about teaching, learning and education at large. Students, in a constructivist learning environment, are invited to work on experiments and authentic problem-solving; with selective use of available resources according to their own interests, research and learning strategies. The authors, as trainers of this workshop, chose ROBONOVA humanoid robots, among other devices, which attempt to partner technology with ideas of constructivism. The materials used in the workshop offer building parts, sensors thus connecting a robot with the external environment and programming software with a simple graphical interface intended for the creation of robot behavioral movements. The idea is “learning by design”, which is central in the constructivist pedagogy introduced firstly by Resnick. In this workshop we corroborate this idea through the project-based learning approach in robotics. Learning tasks of the workshop are organized as projects (small and large) that encourage students to develop their own designs. Projects are either instructor led or completely arisen from students.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4673-1352-0; POD:978-1-4673-1353-7; USB:978-1-4673-1351-3","10.1109/FIE.2012.6462226","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6462226","Constructivism;Humanoid robots;Robotics","Conferences;Educational institutions;Humanoid robots;Robot sensing systems;Service robots","computer aided instruction;control engineering computing;control engineering education;humanoid robots;industrial robots","ROBONOVA humanoid robots;constructivist didactic methodology;humanoid robotics workshop;industrial engineering;industrial robotics;learning by design;problem solving;programming software;project-based learning;robot behavioral movements;teaching","","1","","8","","","","3-6 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A common premise of previous research is that the QoS values of services to target users are supposed to be all known. However, many of QoS values are unknown in reality. This paper presents a neighborhood-based collaborative filtering approach to predict such unknown values for QoS-based selection. Compared with existing methods, the proposed method has three new features: 1) the adjusted-cosine-based similarity calculation to remove the impact of different QoS scale; 2) a data smoothing process to improve prediction accuracy; and 3) a similarity fusion approach to handle the data sparsity problem. In addition, a two-phase neighbor selection strategy is proposed to improve its scalability. An extensive performance study based on a public data set demonstrates its effectiveness.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMCA.2012.2210409","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6301755","Neighborhood-based collaborative filtering (CF);quality-of-service (QoS) prediction;service selection","Accuracy;Equations;Quality of service;Smoothing methods;Time factors;Vectors;Web services","collaborative filtering;quality of service;service-oriented architecture;smoothing methods","QoS values;QoS-based selection;adjusted-cosine-based similarity calculation;data smoothing process;data sparsity problem;neighborhood-based collaborative filtering;public data set;quality of service prediction;quality-of-service-based service selection;service-oriented computing;similarity fusion approach;two-phase neighbor selection strategy","","53","","42","","","20120912","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Aiming at searching for a better schedule, this paper models the system by a timed Petri net. With this model, the properties of the 3-wafer schedule are analyzed. Then, based on the analysis, it is found that, to improve the performance, it is necessary to reduce the number of wafers completed in a cycle. Hence, a 1-wafer schedule is developed by using a new swap-based strategy. By using the Petri net model, its cycle time is analyzed and shown to be optimal. Also, an effective method is presented to implement it.

The game structure allows the students from the storytelling task to have minimum programming skills. For this reason, our design is especially suitable for interdisciplinary collaboration between computer science and disciplines that are not necessarily related with computing. Experiments on students' emotions have been developed to demonstrate that the motivation increases when the students learn through the design of videogames instead of through traditional learning strategies.","","Electronic:978-84-939814-7-1; POD:978-1-4799-1703-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6403183","interdisciplinary learning;serious games design","Book reviews;Computers;Engines;Games;History;Programming;Psychology","computer aided instruction;computer games;design;programming","computer game;computer science;game design;interdisciplinary collaboration;interdisciplinary design;motivating method;programming skill;programming task;skill acquisition;storytelling task;videogame","","0","","28","","","","29-31 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the year 2011-2012 Government of India has provided Rs fifty three thousand crores to Ministry of Human Resources development for uplifting the education system in India. Although similar budgets have been allotted by the government previously in many years to improve the education system but in spite of that one fourth population of the country is still uneducated and in this figure educated means number of peoples who have passed their school, if we check for college level then this percent again going to reduced. Now searching for the reasons responsible for this we find the major one as there is no centralized system for the government to check the educational institutes in which not only the year end result produced is checked but it consist of throughout monitoring of all the education institutes in India. The lack of distribution of resources like teaching tools, teaching stuffs etc. As Cloud Computing technology is the most promising technology that binds solution to all the mentioned deficiency, thus we propose that with the help of this technology we can overcome these deficiencies and reach our goal of hundred percent literacy rates and also the goal to provide quality education to each and every citizen of India.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4669-0; POD:978-1-4673-5693-0","10.1109/ICCCNT.2012.6395909","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6395909","Cloud Computing;Cloud strategy;Education System;cloud architecture and its implementations","Abstracts;Books;Educational institutions;Gold;Government;Interrupters","cloud computing;educational computing;educational institutions;further education;human resource management","Indian education system;centralized system;cloud computing technology;college level;educational institutes;higher college level education;human resource development;hundred percent literacy rates;quality education","","2","","12","","","","26-28 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, to search for a better schedule, a Petri net model is developed for a dual-arm cluster tool with wafer revisit. With it, the properties of the 3-wafer schedule are analyzed.

Finally, the paper discusses the challenges faced along the implementation process and provides an overview of lessons learnt. This paper observes that if used effectively, eLearning can enhance ubiquity, equity and quality in medical education and the development of appropriate skills in the developing countries' medical care systems. The paper suggests that in order to improve the quality of medical education under limited resource settings, universities in developing countries should effectively make use of innovative and emerging technologies which are relevant to their respective environments. A successful implementation of eLearning requires a strategic approach which should be embedded by the university management, academic staff and students.

"Today's workforce in tomorrow's smart grid: Bridging the growing gaps","S. Varadan","","2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","20121110","2012","","","1","1","Summary form only given. In the light of the ongoing activities related to the “smart grid”, the perception that today's utility workforce is woefully inadequate and not up to par has gained considerable bite. As the discussions around smart grid have evolved, the industry, espoused by the US-DOE, has reached a consensus and formally defined the requirements for tomorrow's smart grid. Yet, it is not clear what exactly is expected of tomorrow's workforce. Should there be an emphasis on power system engineering, communication technologies, green generation technologies, basic sciences, hardware, software, engineering management, or plain vanilla “soft” skills? Present trends in the industry including the aging asset base, aging workforce, integration of renewable and sustainable resources - all in the background of Smart Grid, make the discussions around what is expected of the future utility work force even more complicated. University faculty and industry personnel are trying to figure out the answers to the questions above and common themes are slowly emerging as there is no definitive consensus on the expected needs of the future utility workforce. Even so, the concept of holistic education and critical thinking seem to be recurring themes at all levels. Consensus about the importance of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is another point of convergence. Implementation of ICT in various business processes and the effective breaking down of silos is an underlying theme in leveraging critical data out of which meaningful information, and knowledge, may be extracted to effect local change but with global consequences. This paper provides a critical view of the gaps that need to be bridged to transition today's utility workforce in the wake of tomorrow's anticipated smart grid needs. Advertised utility positions, such as Manager, Smart Grid and Technology Integration Strategy and Systems Engineer, Power Systems & - mart Grid will be examined in detail as a means to develop a better sense of understanding of what, and how, utilities are doing to bridge the perceived gaps in today's and tomorrow's utility workforce. Efforts at leading universities, technical schools and government agencies (such as CEWD and NSF) are described as well. Certificate programs and new course curricula addressing a more holistic approach are presented. Another important aspect of these efforts is the way in which these new courses are delivered as technology has changed the way in which workers may be trained, or retrained, using the concepts of on-line and long-distance learning programs. These “learn at your own pace” courses are gaining popularity along with more traditional time-bound courses delivered in a class-room setting as more and more people are being drawn towards a career in the “electric” energy business.","1932-5517;19325517","Electronic:978-1-4673-2729-9; POD:978-1-4673-2727-5; USB:978-1-4673-2728-2","10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344686","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6344686","Smart Grid Training;Utility Workforce Needs","Aging;Business;Communications technology;Educational institutions;Industries;Smart grids","computer aided instruction;distance learning;educational courses;power engineering computing;power engineering education;smart power grids","ICT;US-DOE;aging asset base;aging workforce;business processes;communication technology;electric energy business;government agencies;green generation technology;information and communication technology;long-distance learning programs;online learning programs;power system engineering;sustainable resources;technology integration strategy;tomorrow smart grid;utility workforce","","1","","","","","","22-26 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, an expanded data strategy from a prior simulator has been introduced to solve the modeling problem of small data set. Finally, the electrical performance and mechanical structure are optimized by using the developed model, and the obtained results can assist the fabrication of the same filter in the future.

A typical approach for user location privacy protection is to blur a user location into a cloaked set of road segments S such that S satisfies the user specified privacy requirements. However, these location cloaking algorithms work with snapshot locations only and do not consider the effect of continuous location updates. Applying these algorithms directly to continuous queries would lead to privacy leakage if attackers have knowledge about maximum user velocity, namely velocity-based Attack. In this paper, we present the privacy safety condition to defend against velocity-based attack, and propose an anonymity algorithm based on greedy strategy to preserve user privacy.

Therefore, pervasive applications need a middleware that can detect and act upon any context changes created by the result of any interactions between users, applications, and surrounding computing environment for applications without users, interventions. To achieve this goal, one of the problems is how to continuously monitor/capture and interpret the environment related information efficiently to assure high context awareness by the middleware. Many attentions have been paid to the research of the context-aware pervasive applications. Existing context information that supports service (component) adaptations is provided by the context-aware infrastructure, which gathers, pre-processes and provisions context information from a variety of context information sources. However, the context-aware applications is usually prone to failures and disconnections that negatively impact on the ability of them to adapt (and therefore dramatically impact on their usability). So we should take the Quality of Context (QoC) into account. And the procession of gathering, pre-processing and providing context information must be autonomic to the end users. Therefore, we propose an autonomic quality management middleware to support QoC management based context provision. By this middleware, we can configure different strategies to refinery raw context, discard duplicate and inconsistent context adaptively so as to protect and provide QoS-enriched context information of users to context-aware applications and services.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-0242-5; POD:978-1-4673-0241-8","10.1109/ICCSE.2012.6295288","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295288","Agent;Context-aware;Pervasive;QoC;middleware","Cognition;Computers;Context;Context-aware services;Middleware;Sensors","middleware;mobile computing;quality of service","QoS-enriched context information;autonomic context processing;autonomic quality management middleware;context awareness;context-aware pervasive applications;distributed mobile computing;environment related information;information technology;refinery raw context","","1","","13","","","","14-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This context is strongly marked by an evolution of the individual activity and team management towards participative, collaborative and partner processes often driven or realized in a project management system such as CSCW platform. This article identifies the new skills which must be improved by the various actors of an innovative project, in order to ensure both the evolution of the individual and the organization. It then presents in which ways experiential learning strategies can be used in this context. Indeed, by observing cognitive mechanisms and social interactions in knowledge construction, we propose an ICT (Information and Communication Technology) platform for long life change management, which combines e-assistance and work practice activities.

In this letter, we propose a distributed power allocation strategy that makes the system's Signal-Noise-Ratio (SNR) performance improve monotonically in the number of the relays. Each terminal can relay its overheard information with specified transmission power according to its own channel information separately. Consequently, the NP problem of solving the optimal relay subset in previous central mode is transformed into the problem of power allocation and distributed relay scheduling is realized in a simple way. Through Monte Carlo simulations being carried out under Rayleigh fading channel condition, the performance of the proposed scheme is highlighted by comparing with previous central mode schemes.","1089-7798;10897798","","10.1109/LCOMM.2012.060812.121088","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6218677","Wireless cooperative communication;power allocation;relay selection","Bit error rate;Cooperative systems;Relays;Resource management;Signal to noise ratio;Wireless communication","","","","3","","6","","","20120615","August 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Instead of deploying a large initial offset to all the users, Elite seeks the possibility of initializing users with layered proportional initial scheduling point, thus achieving differentiated playback lag service for the system. For saving server bandwidth and reducing lag time, Elite employs a novel strategy which arranges peers into a virtual tree structure and quantifies playback lag of each layer that finally converges to a constant value. This way, Elite can help users to achieve much shorter average playback lag and prioritized service within the same channel. As illustrated in our design, analysis, and simulation studies, Elite is able to fully exploit limited pool of server bandwidth to support peer-assisted live streaming with prioritized playback lag, and achieves shorter average playback lag compared with synchronized strategy, such as R<sup>2</sup>.","1548-615X;1548615X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1298-1; POD:978-1-4673-1296-7; USB:978-1-4673-1297-4","10.1109/IWQoS.2012.6245971","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6245971","Live Streaming;Peer-to-Peer;Playback Lag","Bandwidth;Delay;Media;Peer to peer computing;Servers;Streaming media;Synchronization","peer-to-peer computing;video servers;video streaming","Elite;layered proportional initial scheduling point;peer assisted live streaming;peer assisted live video streaming;playback lag problem;server bandwidth","","1","","20","","","","4-5 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Particularly, Petri nets are considered as a popular formalism because of their inherent characteristics. They received much attention over the past decades to deal with deadlock problems, leading to a variety of deadlock-control policies. This study surveys the state-of-the-art deadlock-control strategies for automated manufacturing systems by reviewing the principles and techniques that are involved in preventing, avoiding, and detecting deadlocks. The focus is deadlock prevention due to its large and continuing stream of efforts. A control strategy is evaluated in terms of computational complexity, behavioral permissiveness, and structural complexity of its deadlock-free supervisor.

In general, the optimal joint power and subchannel allocation is known as NP-hard. To ease the computation complexity while maintain good performance, we propose a novel particle swarm optimization (PSO) based joint uplink power and subchannel allocation algorithm to solve this resource allocation problem. Due to the combinatorial nature of the resource allocation problem, our algorithm in which power continuously changes while the subchannel allocation strategy alters in the iteration process can obtain better performance than the existing decomposition based algorithm that subchannel assignment and power allocation are implemented separately.

"Visualisation to enhance students' engineering design ability","M. Mavinkurve; S. Murthy","IDP in Educational Technology, Powai, Mumbai, India","2012 IEEE International Conference on Technology Enhanced Education (ICTEE)","20120531","2012","","","1","8","One of the objectives of engineering education as per ABET is to develop design skills among students. Some universities have applied instructional strategies to teach engineering design ability and studies have shown that they have positive impact on student's learning. In spite of this, the focus on design is not common in engineering course. One possible reason is due to the specialized requirements that are difficult to implement in a traditional course - i.e. large number of specially trained teachers, infrastructure resources, lack of instructional material and pedagogical barriers such as assessment of such courses. A possible solution to address these problems is to integrate traditional instruction with visualisations such as animation, simulation and other visual learning tools. This paper suggests the use of visualisation to develop students' engineering design ability. The first step is to identify engineering design competencies and related sub-competencies. These sub-competencies serve as indicators to define the required features of visualisation. In this paper, we describe the process of identifying engineering design competencies, features of visualization which address the development of these competencies and supporting instructional activities. While most of our processes can be adapted to develop students' design competencies in any engineering course, we restrict our scope to an electronics course within an Indian university environment.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0726-1; POD:978-1-4577-0725-4","10.1109/ICTEE.2012.6208671","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208671","Engineering design competency;Engineering design education;Engineering design sub-competency;Instructional activity;Visualisation","Educational institutions;Engineering education;FETs;Materials;Reverse engineering;Visualization","computer aided instruction;computer animation;data visualisation;educational courses;electronic engineering computing;electronic engineering education","ABET;Indian university environment;animation;electronics course;engineering course;engineering design competencies;engineering education;student engineering design ability;visual learning tool;visualisation","","0","","42","","","","3-5 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Optimal Lane Reservation in Transportation Network","Y. Fang; F. Chu; S. Mammar; M. Zhou","Laboratory IBISC, University of Evry-Val d'Essonne, Evry, France","IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","20120529","2012","13","2","482","491","This work studies a lane reservation problem in a transportation network. It aims to design task paths and optimally select lanes to be reserved in a transportation network. In this problem, each lane has limited residual capacity, which is the lane capacity that can be used for the tasks causing no delay in this lane. If the residual capacity of a lane is not large enough to allow tasks to use it, the reservation of this lane is necessary. Once reserved, the lane can be used by the tasks only. Therefore, the travel time in this reserved lane is less than that when it is not reserved. Such lane reservation strategy ensures that each task can transport the commodity from its source to destination within a given travel time. However, this reserved lane generates traffic impact on nonreserved lanes. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total impact of all reserved lanes on nonreserved lanes subject to the timely completion of all the concerned tasks. In this paper, two integer linear programming models are, for the first time, formulated. The complexity of the problem is demonstrated to be non-deterministic polynomial-time hard. Then, an optimal algorithm based on the cut-and-solve method is developed for the problem. The computational results of randomly generated network instances up to 120 nodes and 468 arcs show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the direct use of an optimization solver of CPLEX.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2011.2171337","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6099683","Cut-and-solve method;linear programming;optimization;traffic control;transportation systems","Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Delay;Educational institutions;Upper bound;Vehicles","integer programming;linear programming;minimisation;road traffic;transportation","CPLEX;cut-and-solve method;integer linear programming;lane capacity;nondeterministic polynomial-time hard;optimal algorithm;optimal lane reservation;optimization solver;residual capacity;task path;traffic impact;transportation network;travel time","","30","","37","","","20111209","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Results indicate significant differences in gender in social activities versus action oriented type games but little difference in types of fitness activities. Across age groups there were some significant differences in terms of their interest in games involving strategy, action and violence. Also of note was that youth in the range of 14-15 tended to view physical activities as more difficult versus those both older and younger than them for the ages we studied. Youth also differed significantly in the type of mobile facilities they used with those older than 13 tending to use G.P.S., music and video facilities much more than those aged 11 to 13.

The theory of regions is recognized as the unique method for obtaining maximally permissive (i.e., optimal) controllers in the existing literature. All legal and live maximal behavior of a Petri net model can be preserved by using a marking/transition-separation instance (MTSI). However, obtaining them is an extremely time consuming problem. This work proposes crucial MTSIs that allow designers to employ much fewer MTSIs to deal with deadlocks. The advantage of the proposed policy is that an optimal deadlock controller can be obtained with drastically reduced computation. Experimental results, by varying the markings of given net structures, indicate that it is the most efficient policy to obtain such controllers.","1083-4427;10834427","","10.1109/TSMCA.2011.2164241","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6029338","Deadlock prevention;Petri net (PN);discrete event system;flexible manufacturing system (FMS);theory of regions","Control systems;Equations;Flexible manufacturing systems;Law;Mathematical model;System recovery","Petri nets;flexible manufacturing systems;production engineering computing;system recovery","Petri net model;computationally improved optimal deadlock control policy;deadlock avoidance;deadlock detection;deadlock prevention;flexible manufacturing systems;marking-transition-separation instance;maximally permissive controllers;net structures","","35","","46","","","20110926","March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As a result, women engineers and computer scientists must find ways to manage the conflict between their identities as women and as creators of technology. Many women manage the conflict by hiding or denying their feminine identity. We found that this strategy becomes particularly evident when discussing experiences of sexism. Focus groups with women graduate students identified many instances of sexism, but found that women tended to deny or ignore the sexism. Because sexism communicates the view that women do not fit in the culture of computing, it increases the difficulty of combining a feminine gender identity with a technical identity. Many women try to meet this challenge by minimizing their femininity, or acting like one of the guys. These coping strategies may be effective for enabling individual persistence, but they permit persistence of an inhospitable environment. Adopting practices known to reduce the incidence of sexism and mitigate its negative impact could help retain women graduate students in computing.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-61284-469-5; POD:978-1-61284-468-8; USB:978-1-61284-467-1","10.1109/FIE.2011.6142915","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6142915","computer science engineering;doctoral education;gender identity;sexism","Cities and towns;Computer science;Computers;Conferences;Educational institutions;Industries;Medical services","computer science education;gender issues","computing graduate programs;conflicted identity;feminine gender identity;sexism;technical identity;women graduate students","","0","","21","","","","12-15 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most common simulators in the literature are visually attractive, but are often designed to solve a particular or limited problem. Authoring tools have the advantage to allow building several learning environments, involving professors without computer expertise. Therefore, teachers require less effort and time to develop simulation problems. In this work we present an on line authoring simulation tool, called AuthorPhysics, aimed to facilitate the design of physics active learning problems, reducing instructors' time and effort. An initial evaluation of the usability and benefits of the system for the instructors was carried on.

The trans-classroom teacher who moves between the two environments, transferring ideas, strategies, and practices from one to the other, is a mental migrant. The transformations -- of the teacher and of the course -- that occur in these migrations and the two-way interactions between face-to-face and online teaching are the focus of this study. As teachers adapt their courses for the online environment, they are forced to re-examine the course design, reconsider curriculum strategies, and make many decisions about what to take out and what to keep, what to add and what to substitute. The implication for faculty who would like to implement mobile learning in their online or traditional courses is that they can begin by making content and information available to students in formats easily accessible by mobile phone or laptop computer. This would be a logical first step, since a majority of students and faculty already use these tools in many of their daily activities. Other tools, such as video iPods and MP3 players, can be phased in gradually. The following ideas could be implemented immediately with little to no additional cost. Most basic cell phones today can send and receive text messages, voice mail, and e-mail.

Due to the characteristics of multiple beats constituting an ECG and the high cost of having all the beats manually labeled, supervised machine learning techniques have achieved limited success in ECG classification. In this paper, we first discuss the rational for applying multiple instance learning (MIL) to automated ECG classification and propose a new MIL strategy called LTMIL for it which integrates the intra and inter ECG difference. It is a three hierarchical model. Firstly, we cluster all unlabeled beats into k topics using variable weighting, by which beats are reshaped to be dense and separable. An ECG and its beats are then represented as mixtures over topics. Consequently, the intra and inter ECG difference can be fully embodied in the difference between mixtures over topics. Finally, any supervised learning techniques can be applied to classification of transformed ECGs. Our experimental results on real ECG datasets from the PTB diagnostic database demonstrate that compared with existing multiple instance learning and supervised machine learning algorithms, the proposed algorithm is able to automatically classify ECG without labeling beats and improves the classification quality in terms of sensitivity and specificity.","","Electronic:978-1-61284-704-7; POD:978-1-61284-701-6","10.1109/ITiME.2011.6132169","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6132169","ECG Classification;Mixture of Topics;Multiple Instance Learning","Classification algorithms;Electrocardiography;Feature extraction;Sensitivity;Sensitivity and specificity;Support vector machines;Training","electrocardiography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;medical signal processing;signal classification","PTB diagnostic database;automated ECG classification;classification quality;electrocardiograph;inter ECG difference;intra ECG difference;latent topic multiple instance learning;multiple beats;real ECG datasets;supervised machine learning techniques;variable weighting","","1","","24","","","","9-11 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This process consists of two coupled tanks and a pump to feed the liquid to the system. The process variables (levels) are transmitted to the PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) thought a voltage signal. The control signal, in volts, generated in the PLC, is sent to the pump. The control objective (regulator problem) is to keep the tanks levels in the considered operation point even in disturbance presence. The RMPC is a technique that allows explicit incorporation of the plant uncertainty in the problem formulation. The goal is to design, at each time step, a state-feedback control law that minimizes a 'worst-case' infinite horizon objective function, subject to constraint in the control input. The existence of a feedback control law and satisfying the input constraints is reduced to a convex optimization over linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) problem. It is shown that for the plant uncertainty described by the polytope, the feasible receding horizon state feedback control design is robustly stabilizing. The software implementation of the RMPC is made using Scilab, and its communication with Coupled Tanks Systems is done through the OLE for Process Control (OPC) industrial protocol.","1553-572X;1553572X","Electronic:978-1-61284-972-0; POD:978-1-61284-969-0; USB:978-1-61284-971-3","10.1109/IECON.2011.6119358","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6119358","","Mathematical model;Optimization;Predictive control;Predictive models;Robustness;Uncertainty","control engineering computing;control system synthesis;convex programming;linear matrix inequalities;predictive control;process control;programmable controllers;protocols;robust control;state feedback;tanks (containers);uncertain systems","LMI robust predictive control;OLE for process control;OPC industrial protocol;PLC;RMPC software implementation;Scilab;control signal;convex optimization;coupled tanks systems;linear matrix inequalities;online control strategy;plant uncertainty;programmable logic controller;receding horizon state feedback control design;robust model predictive control technique;robust stabilization;state-feedback control law;voltage signal;worst-case infinite horizon objective function","","2","","18","","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ability to accurately choose the right education and training paths leading to the acquisition of the right competences required for a given job position, as well as the capability to properly select human resources based on precise job requirements are becoming more and more key factors to success. Nevertheless, the comparison of education opportunities generally requires a manual analysis of huge qualification descriptions and course syllabi, whereas staff selection (or job seeking activities) often relies on non-automated processes mainly based on an extensive check of applicants' curriculum vitae (or of possible job offers). The above tasks are extremely time consuming and, given the large amount of information to be considered, they also risk to provide unsatisfactory results. In this paper, the above issues are addressed in the perspective of semantic technologies. In particular, a web-based application is presented, which exploits ontological descriptions and tag cloud-based visualization strategies to generate a direct representation of the overlap between learners' needs and existing education and training paths, as well as between job seekers' profiles and company requirements.

We improved the original QGA by quantum crossover operator, in order to overcome the shortcoming of the original QGA easily falling into a local extremum when used to optimize the continuous functions with many extrema. We used our improved QGA as a competitive strategy and conducted several simulations in two-user system and multi-user system. From simulation results, it is evident that the proposed improved QGA based spectrum sharing scheme has better convergence rate and higher sum capacity than GA based scheme even in multi-user CR system, namely up to 2bit/s/Hz increase in capacity. The simulation results also show that the population size of QGA affect sum capacity of cognitive radio system.

Various measures have been taken to solve these problems. However, none of them have been proven to be effective. The baby dumping and abortion cases tragically increase by years. As an Islamic country, it is wise to refer to the religious approach for solutions. Sex education in Islam provides guidelines in manners related to what is allowed and forbidden, and stresses the faith towards the religion. Islam believes that parents play the main role to educate their children about this matter. Even so, the parents seem to be unaware on the importance of this form of education. Furthermore, the deficiency of this `taboo' learning material in conveying the information makes the situation more stressful. Thus, the objective of this study is to propose an Islamic Sex Education (ISE) interactive courseware. It also attempts to change the parents' motivational level in encouraging the awareness towards Islamic sex education. This paper covers the motivational design and development of the ISE interactive courseware. Besides that, it also includes the literature review of the study and the methodology involved.

"Considerable factors of incorporating PDAs to medical education","R. Luanrattana","Dept. of Bus. Inf. Syst., Assumption Univ., Thailand","2011 International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training","20110915","2011","","","1","8","Personal digital assistants (PDAs) have become a popular tool among physicians and medical trainees. PDAs are used for various purposes by healthcare professions and students. However most of these users are physicians, and the devices assist them in patient tracking, documentation, clinical decision making in order to decrease the number of adverse events and enhance their learning. PDAs seem to be a valuable tool in both the medical profession and education. However, the influence factors for incorporating PDAs into medical curriculum have yet to be evaluated and determined. Therefore there is a need to conduct this study for the incorporation of PDAs to medical education. Aim: The purpose of this study is to address potential factors which may impact the incorporation of PDAs to medical education, including data security and information privacy, interoperability, scalability and network connectivity, education and training, familiarity of using PDAs (technology comfort), electromagnetic interference, social acceptance, maintenance and support and other relevant aspects. Now, the evidence in the literature is much less definite as to whether such factors may affect the incorporation of PDAs to medical education. Methods: The qualitative in-depth interviews were used to explore the attitudes of participants regarding the incorporation of PDAs into medical curriculum. The semi-structured interview questions were formulated based on the two-phase literature reviews and scoping study. Results: Two major aspects for the incorporation of PDAs into the PBL-medical curriculum at the UOW were determined from the interviews, these being technical and practical aspects. Considerable factors in IT aspect are data security and information privacy, data transmission and network connectivity, maintenance and support and interoperability among different PDA platforms. The practical aspects comprise three major components, which may influence the incorporation of PDAs into medical- - curriculum, these being, education and training, electromagnetic interference and social acceptance, respectively. Conclusion: Factors to be considered before incorporating PDAs into medical education have been identified. What has yet to be determined is the strategy for incorporating of these devices into PBL-context, what necessary information for students should be carried on their PDAs, what information would be suitable for students in evidence-based medicine, how to ensure that incorporation of PDAs provides students and medical faculty effective learning given the attendant financial and resource implications.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1672-0; POD:978-1-4577-1673-7","10.1109/ITHET.2011.6018686","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6018686","IT adoption;e-learning;feasibility;handheld computers;mobile learning;personal digital assistants","Data privacy;Data security;Educational institutions;Interviews;Maintenance engineering;Personal digital assistants","computer aided instruction;data privacy;health care;medical computing;notebook computers;open systems;social aspects of automation","PBL-medical curriculum;PDAs;clinical decision making;data security aspect;electromagnetic interference aspect;evidence-based medicine;information privacy aspect;interoperability aspect;maintenance aspect;medical curriculum;medical education;network connectivity aspect;patient documentation;patient tracking;personal digital assistants;scalability aspect;social acceptance aspect;technology comfort aspect","","0","","9","","","","4-6 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They have diverse cultures, traditions and ways of living, beliefs and language. The Malaysian government is providing assistance in developing Orang Asli education by preparing certain educational assistance for the Orang Asli to remain in schools. In general, there has been significant improvements in the overall school attendance of the Orang Asli. Research done in 2007 by UNICEF shows dropout has decreased over the past 15 years; however 80 percent from of the Orang Asli children still do not complete their secondary school. This problem may be due to the teaching strategy in classroom which may not fit the students' cultures, traditions, ways of living, beliefs and language. This also may apply to the ICTL subject. In Malaysia, the importance of ICT in the education system has been realized as one way to achieve the 2001-2010 education Development Plan. Since the Orang Asli have their own paradigm of education, there should be special teaching methodologies to attract the students' interest, attention and focus in the ICTL subject. In order to achieve this, the teacher should build the ICT program by selecting content and adapting the curricula to address students' learning needs, interest and prior knowledge. They should guides and facilitate learning with a suitable methodology in the classroom. To carry out this study, the ADDIE model is used as a methodology. The aim of this study is to investigate and identify suitable teaching strategy for Orang Asli towards learning ICTL subjects. Based on the identified teaching methodology for Orang Asli, the researchers will develop an ICTL module which suits them.","","Electronic:978-1-61284-130-4; POD:978-1-61284-128-1","10.1109/CITA.2011.5999512","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5999512","ICTL;Orang Asli;indigenous;teaching methodology;teaching strateg","Asia;Computers;Context;Cultural differences;Educational institutions;Mathematics","educational administrative data processing;information science education;teaching","ADDIE model;ICT program;ICTL module development;ICTL-TeMfOA;Malaysian government;Orang Asli education;Peninsular Malaysia;UNICEF;aborigines;educational assistance;teaching methodology;teaching strategy","","0","","15","","","","12-13 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then there is an analysis of the stakeholder perceptions to identify what are the main factors MNCs need to address in their CSR practices in China. Evidence suggests that Chinese stakeholders have different expectations for CSR practices in China due to institutional differences and social, cultural and economic development differences.

In order to identify the changes of process, an efficiently adaptive strategy based on batch-to-batch information is used. It efficiently updates a trained multi-LSSVR model by means of incremental updating and decremental pruning algorithms whenever a new batch sample is added to, or removed from the training set.

Up to now, it is a challenging problem, where the demand for less forensics overhead, higher authentication level and smaller transmission delay needs to be reconciled with the limited and often dynamic network resources. Traditional multimedia forensics mechanisms, however, either overlook the available network resource or neglect the interaction between multimedia forensics and network scheduling. This work presents a novel framework for delay-sensitive multimedia applications over resource-limited heterogeneous networks by jointly considering multimedia forensics, network adaptation, and deadline-driven scheduling. In particular, we develop a joint forensics-scheduling scheme, which allocates the available network resources based on the affordable forensics overhead and expected quality of service, adaptively adjusts the scalable media-aware forensics, and schedules the transmissions to meet the application's delay constraints. Through analysis and simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme not only can provide a satisfying multimedia forensics service with nearly full utilization of the network resource, but also can achieve substantial performance improvements compared to other reference approaches.","0733-8716;07338716","","10.1109/JSAC.2011.110803","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5963156","Multimedia forensics;delay-sensitive application;heterogeneous networks;network scheduling","Authentication;Delay;Forensics;Joints;Multimedia communication;Streaming media","authorisation;computer network security;forensic science;multimedia communication;multimedia computing;resource allocation","application delay constraint;deadline-driven scheduling;delay sensitive multimedia application;dynamic network resource allocation;high quality multimedia forensics service;higher authentication level;joint forensics scheduling scheme;joint forensics scheduling strategy;multimedia forensics mechanism;network adaptation;network scheduling;quality of service;resource limited heterogeneous network resource;scalable media-aware forensics;transmission delay","","75","","34","","","","August 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Based on this analysis, security analysts, investors and also students can make prudent investment decisions by comparing this value with the current market price of the stock. To analyze the pros and cons of fundamental analysis in this article an educational computer program called SP will be presented, which calculates on the basis of companies balance sheet and income statement data provided by Standard and Poor's several important ratios. Among these ratios, are up and down beta factor, price-earnings ratio, dividend yield, debt-equity ratio etc. Taking into account a lot of data from the Standard and Poor's database the program enables users to calculate new and even different ratios which do not exist in the original database and are important for investment decisions. The goal of such an approach for students is to simulate different investment strategies based on fundamental analysis, by picking specific stocks which meet their investment criteria, tracking their performance for a predefined investment period and analyzing the results. Doing so they are better prepared for ""real life"" investments in the mature stock markets and especially in the more volatile emerging stock markets.","","Electronic:978-953-233-059-5; POD:978-1-4577-0996-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5967210","","Companies;Computers;Databases;Industries;Investments;Software;Stock markets","database management systems;educational computing;investment;management education;stock markets","balance sheet;company information;company stock market price;educational computer program;industry factor;investment analysis;investment decision;price-earning ratio;product demand;real life investment strategy;security analysts;stock fundamental analysis","","1","","4","","","","23-27 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the control of these wind generators is a very technical discipline, practical teaching methodologies are of special relevance. Paradoxically, in the past, the training of engineers specializing in this area has lacked the practical component represented by field tests, due to the difficulty of access to this kind of installation. This paper presents a system designed for use both in teaching and training procedures for control strategies for wind generators with doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) technology. The system includes two phases or levels of use: the first being a simulation phase based on computer models, and the second, an advanced level which allows for the conducting of tests on a laboratory scaled workbench composed of a wind turbine emulator coupled to an electric generator. With this equipment, the effectiveness of the wind generator regulation systems can be analyzed from the point of view of the maximum power point tracking control strategy, as well as from that of the contribution produced by the wind generator to the control of the operation of the electric grid to which it is connected.","0885-8950;08858950","","10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2083703","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5620949","Control systems;educational technology;induction generators;simulation;wind power generation","Computational modeling;Converters;Generators;Reactive power;Rotors;Stators;Voltage control","asynchronous generators;computer based training;control engineering education;machine control;power engineering computing;power engineering education;power generation control;power grids;teaching;training;wind power plants","DFIG;computer models;computer-based simulation;doubly fed induction wind generators control;electric generator;electric grid;engineer training;maximum power point tracking control strategy;scaled laboratory bench system;teaching;wind turbine emulator","","18","","18","","","20101109","Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In current studies, the search ranges of these components are always pre-defined carefully by expert designers, making it difficult for practical applications. In this paper, the search space is freely set to the commonly used ranges and an efficient orthogonal learning particle swarm optimization (OLPSO) is applied to optimally design the PEC with such search space. OLPSO uses an orthogonal learning (OL) strategy for PSO to discover useful information that lies in the personal historical best experience and the neighborhood's best experience via orthogonal experimental design. Therefore, OLPSO can construct a more promising and efficient exemplar to guide particle to fly better towards the global optimal region. OLPSO is implemented to optimize the design of a buck regulator in PEC. The optimized results are compared with those obtained by using a genetic algorithm (GA) approach and those obtained by using PSO with traditional learning strategy. Results show that the OLPSO algorithm is more promising in the design and optimization of the PEC with large search space. Moreover, the simulations results demonstrate the advantages of OLPSO by showing that the circuit optimized by OLPSO exhibits better startup and large-signal disturbance performance when compared with the one optimized by GA.","1089-778X;1089778X","Electronic:978-1-4244-7835-4; POD:978-1-4244-7834-7","10.1109/CEC.2011.5949937","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949937","Control systems;optimization;orthogonal experimental design (OED);particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Algorithm design and analysis;Capacitors;Genetic algorithms;Inductors;Optimization;Power electronics;Resistors","electronic engineering computing;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;power electronics","OLPSO algorithm;PEC optimization;capacitors;free search range;genetic algorithm;inductors;large-signal disturbance performance;orthogonal learning particle swarm optimization;power electronic circuit optimization;resistors","","2","","32","","","","5-8 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As we know, Fuzzy logic provides a mathematical framework that is compatible with poorly quantitative yet qualitatively significant data. In this paper, we have fuzzified our original dataset and have applied various frequent pattern mining techniques to discover meaningful frequent patterns. Also, we have drawn a clear comparison of the frequent pattern mining techniques in the original and the fuzzified data in terms of parameters like runtime of the algorithm and the number of frequent patterns generated.

This paper proposes an intelligent multifeature statistical approach to automatically discriminate the driving condition of the HEV. First, this approach periodically samples the driving cycle. Then, it extracts multiple statistical features and tests their significance by statistical analysis to select effective features. Afterward, it applies a support vector machine (SVM) and other machine-learning methods to intelligently and automatically discriminate the driving conditions. Compared with others, the proposed approach can compute fast and discriminate in real time during the whole HEV running mode. In our experiments, it reaches an accuracy value of 95%. As a result, our approach can completely mine the valid information from the data and extract multiple features that have clear meanings and significance. Finally, according to the prediction experiment by a neural network, the fitting experiment by the autoregressive moving average model, and the simulation results of the control strategy, it turns out that our proposed approach raises the efficiency of considerably controlling the HEV.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2010.2093129","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5672601","Driving condition;hybrid electric vehicle (HEV);intelligent multifeature statistical discrimination (IMSD);neural network;statistical feature","Acceleration;Feature extraction;Hybrid electric vehicles;Roads;Statistical analysis","autoregressive moving average processes;control engineering computing;hybrid electric vehicles;neural nets;optimal control;power engineering computing;statistical analysis;support vector machines","SVM;autoregressive moving average model;driving condition discrimination;hybrid electric vehicle;intelligent multifeature statistical approach;machine-learning methods;neural network;optimal control strategy;support vector machine","","29","","48","","","20101220","June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, measurement studies have shown that many popular P2P live streaming systems still suffer from long playback lag, say, more than 100 seconds, which makes the live streaming less realtime. Due to the unstructured nature of P2P networks, it is really a challenge to reduce the playback lag in P2P live streaming system under limited server bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a novel P2P live streaming system - Agiler that aims at reducing the playback lag in lag-sensitive applications under limited server bandwidth. In Agiler, we first group the peers into clusters according to the Autonomous System Number (ASN) and then spread the broadcast in ripples that gradually increase in playback lag as we move away from the media server. It adopts synchronous playback within a cluster to accelerate the chunk diffusion and asynchronous playback among different clusters to facilitate the chunk swarming. Combined with the partitioned buffer strategy and the proportional playback lag strategy, the newly generated fresh chunks can be delivered to all peers in time. The proposed system is evaluated through extensive packet-level simulations, which show the bandwidth utilization ratio of the peers is improved and the average playback lag is significantly reduced.","","Electronic:978-0-9845893-2-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5767014","","Educational institutions;Monitoring;Servers","media streaming;peer-to-peer computing","Agiler;P2P live streaming system;P2P networks;autonomous system number;media server;playback lag","","0","","29","","","","9-12 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A social technical approach was adopted to meet the challenge of effectively integrating technology development and pedagogic practice to address these issues. A semantic wiki was tailored into a social writing environment capable of providing holistic support throughout the whole dissertation process.

By using fuzzy constraints, it not only provides a flexible marking scheme to deal with the imprecision and uncertainty for the representation of assessment but also provides a computational framework to incorporate student's personal characteristics into the process for the reduction of assessment bias. Additionally, a fuzzy constraint-based negotiation mechanism is employed to coordinate the cognitive differences between students. Through iterative agent negotiation, students can reconcile the differences and reach an agreement on the assessment results. Thus, the proposed framework allows students to provide more detailed, informed, and less biased assessments for their peers' work.

Then, to improve the quality of service (QoS) of the education resource sharing network, several key strategies are proposed, including the strategy for a node to join or leave the system, the strategy for searching for resources, and the strategy for setting up connections between nodes. To realize local and global resource retrieval, several algorithms based on the HRRP(k) network are proposed. Finally, the advantages of the HRRP(k) network and the effectiveness of proposed strategies are established by theoretical analysis and comparison.

Recently, one important application direction of SOC is to compose the Web-delivered services (SOAP and RESTful Web services, RSS/Atom feeds, etc) for new Web applications (e.g., the Web mashups). Due to the fact that a number of Web-delivered services fetch data from remote servers, Web applications might require browser cache in order to cooperate with the performance issues (e.g. traffic and latency). However, cache strategies are usually predefined by service providers and brought into effect by browsers. Such pattern of cache makes developers, who are exactly responsible of composing services for Web applications, hardly customize their own cache strategies according to their own application contexts. We argue that, these limited cache strategies may cause unnecessary communications and reduce user experience. This paper proposes a browser-side cache framework for Web-delivered services composition. The main efforts of this paper are as follows. Firstly, our framework allows developers to customize their own cache strategies, such as expiration time, cache granularity and so forth. Secondly, we propose an adaptive technique to adjust cache strategies dynamically, in order to improve cache performance. Finally, we evaluate our framework by conducting experimental studies with the real-world Web-delivered services.","2163-2871;21632871","Electronic:978-1-4244-9801-7; POD:978-1-4244-9802-4","10.1109/SOCA.2010.5707138","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5707138","Web-delivered service;cache;composite application","Adaptation model;Browsers;Data models;Meteorology;Servers;Time frequency analysis;Web services","Web services;cache storage;service-oriented architecture","RESTful Web services;RSS-Atom feeds;SOAP;Web delivered service composition;browser based framework;data cache;service oriented computing","","0","","15","","","","13-15 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, network-based SOA applications are prone to the big impact on Quality of Service (QoS) caused by network instability problem, which implies that developers have to deal with the potential R-OSGi networking exceptions at application layer.

We evaluate and compare the network performances through system-level simulations under different relay deployment patterns. The results show that the interference-aware scheme could boost the coverage range of the RN and provide better cell-edge throughput when the RN density is low.

Student role changed to be knowledge and information hunter rather than receiver, and teaching, meanwhile, is becoming a peripheral activity. Several interactive and new methods of learning has evolved in the last two decades aimed to utilizing the information and communication technology tools to improve the educational process availability and accessibility. The learning management system (LMS) is the system responsible for integrating all learning services and managing teaching and learning activities. It provides a collection of tools and functions to support teaching and learning processes, usually including course management tools, online group discussion, homework collections and grading, and course evaluation. This study was conducted to evaluate different open source learning management systems that were under consideration to be implemented by the College of Medicine, King Saud University (CMKSU), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The study reviewed open source and commercial LMS systems as a future strategy. Objectives: the main objective of the current study was to assess the open source LMS systems based on conducting literature review and practical evaluation. The study included a literature review on LMS including commercial and open source systems. The study focused on evaluating three open source LMS systems, Jusur, Sakai, and Moodle. Jusur is the LMS adopted by the National E-learning center in Saudi Arabia, and the other two LMS systems are considered as the principal open source LMS systems implemented worldwide. Methodology: this study depended on published technical reports, LMS systems official websites, and industry reviews, as well as examining the products features and evaluating how they meet CMKSU needs and requirements. Results: All the three LMS systems provide excellent tools including discussion boards, chat sessions- - , and other collaboration tools. Jusur has a strong localization features and technical support and training. On the other hand Sakai and Moodel were ranked better for the user interface and other content and course management features. Sakai is having the advantage of being developed in Java platform. Moodle and Sakai support integration with other systems, while Jusur support the integration in the offline mode only. Conclusion: Open source LMS systems is more recommended because of its popularity among reputable universities, and the benefits of such systems including exchange of experience and e-courses if the development efforts are guaranteed, as well as the availability of the skills required for the development. In the current study, the evaluation focused on the features of LMS systems and a combination of several frameworks to enhance the evaluation process. All three LMS systems provide excellent tools for student interactions and activities. Standards and integration that make these systems able to communicate with other students and hospitals systems are critical features. In addition, the LMS system should be able as well to mange and accommodate a huge amount of information that needed among medical and educational content, including different subjects, lecture notes, lecture videos, text books, videos of surgeries, and radiology images.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8618-2; POD:978-1-4244-8616-8","10.1109/ICEMT.2010.5657569","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5657569","","Biomedical imaging;Educational institutions;Electronic learning;Information systems;Information technology;Least squares approximation","Java;Web sites;biomedical education;courseware;educational courses;educational institutions;information technology;interactive systems;medical computing;public domain software;teaching","Java platform;Moodle;Sakai;Saudi Arabia;Web site;course management tool;educational process;homework collection;information and communication technology;interactive learning method;learning service;online group discussion;open source learning management system;teaching;university medical education","","6","","32","","","","2-4 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We identify the utility function balanced throughput and cost, and then calculate a Nash equilibrium solution (NES) as the transmission threshold. It allows each node to determine whether or not it is feasible to transmit concurrently depending on channel conditions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium Solution of the game, and compute it using numerical methods. Simulation results show the proposed approach is feasible. On the basis, we propose multiple concurrent transmissions framework by game theory for wireless ad hoc networks.

In this study, we keep focusing on the ANN model and compare three strategies of parallelizing the ANN parameter optimization procedure with OpenMP and MPI APIs. Not surprisingly, the outcomes show that all three parameter optimization procedures indeed converged or executed more quickly with the aid of parallel processing. In particular, the genetic-based method tends to derive the best accuracy and require less execution time. Most important of all, potentially due to a more diverse search space provided by the distributed parallel processing environment, the accuracy of the genetic-based ANN classifier may also be improved in general. In addition, with appropriate combinations of features and parameters setting, the accuracy in LD identification model has exceeded the 90% mark (using 5-fold cross validation), which is the best we have achieved so far. The result suggests that genetic-based (or perhaps similar) optimization methods may be benefited, both in reducing execution time and achieving better outcome, from current grid-based computing technologies.","1062-922X;1062922X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6588-0; POD:978-1-4244-6586-6","10.1109/ICSMC.2010.5642486","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5642486","Evolutionary Computation;Genetic Algorithm;Grid Computing;Learning Disabilities;Neural Network","Artificial neural networks;Genetics;Indexes;Organizations;Predictive models;Servers","application program interfaces;artificial intelligence;computer aided instruction;diseases;genetic algorithms;grid computing;neural nets;parallel processing;pattern classification;psychology","ANN classifier;API;MPI;OpenMP;artificial neural network;feature selection method;genetic algorithm;grid computing;learning disabilities;parallel processing;parameter optimization;students diagnosis","","1","","29","","","","10-13 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Australia was the first country to be targeted by Internet bank phishing in 2003 and continues to have a significant problem in this area. The major cyber crime groups responsible for phishing are based in Eastern Europe. They operate with a large degree of freedom due to the inherent difficulties in cross border law enforcement and the current situation in Eastern Europe, particularly in Russia and the Ukraine. They employ highly sophisticated and efficient technical tools to compromise victims and subvert bank authentication systems. However because it is difficult for them to repatriate the fraudulently obtained funds directly they employ Internet money mules in Australia to transfer the money via Western Union or Money gram. It is proposed a strategy, which firstly places more focus by Australian law enforcement upon transactions via Western Union and Money gram to detect this money laundering, would significantly impact the success of the Phishing attack model. This combined with a technical monitoring of Trojan technology and education of potential Internet money mules to avoid being duped would provide a winning strategy for the war on phishing for Australia.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4186-0; POD:978-1-4244-8054-8","10.1109/CTC.2010.13","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5615076","Cybercrime;Eastern European organised crime;Money laundering;Phishing","Australia;Computer crime;Electronic mail;Europe;Internet;Law enforcement;Trojan horses","Internet;banking;computer crime;invasive software","Internet bank phishing;Internet money mules;Money gram;Trojan technology;Western Union;bank authentication systems;cross border law enforcement;cyber crime groups;online identity theft;phishing war","","8","","31","","","","19-20 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A reservoir is generated randomly and only a readout layer is training. Its simplicity and ease of use, paired with its underlying computational power make it an ideal choice for many application domains, for example time-series prediction, speech recognition, noise modeling, dynamic pattern classification, reinforcement learning and language modeling. However it is necessary to adjust the parameters and the topology to create a “good” reservoir for a given application. This paper presents an original investigation of an evolutionary method for simultaneous optimization of parameters, topology and reservoir weights in Echo State Networks. Optimizing reservoirs is a challenge and several evolutionary strategies for optimizing reservoirs have been presented, generally using the idea of separating the topology and reservoir weights to reduce the search space. Here we present a method to optimize everything in concert. The results of this method applied to two different time series are shown and conferred with previous works.","2161-4393;21614393","Electronic:978-1-4244-6918-5; POD:978-1-4244-6916-1","10.1109/IJCNN.2010.5596913","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5596913","","Evolutionary computation;Neurons;Reservoirs;Time series analysis;Topology;Training;Wind speed","optimisation;recurrent neural nets;time series","artificial recurrent neural network;echo state networks;evolutionary method;parameter optimization;reservoir computing;time series","","2","","21","","","","18-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A stream building process (SBP) is defined as the process that a peer tries to build enough download streams. We argue that a SBP can be roughly seen as a stochastic process composed by random events of stream test, and the time cost of SBP statistically depends on the sequence of requested peers. By modeling the probability of successful request and peers' behaviors of joining and leaving, we construct a simulation system of P2P streaming with two alternative strategies. We trace the distribution of the time costs of SBPs in the system, and show our strategy can reduce at least 23% time cost of streaming building processes.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6005-2; POD:978-1-4244-6002-1","10.1109/ICCSE.2010.5593455","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5593455","P2P streaming;robustness;stream building process","Buildings;Load modeling;Media;Peer to peer computing;Robustness;Servers;Testing","peer-to-peer computing;probability","P2P streaming system;SBP time cost;probability;stochastic process;stream building processes;stream test event","","0","","17","","","","24-27 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a new replication approach which is adaptive, completely decentralized, and based on swarm intelligence which is intrinsically a bottom-up approach. Every site in the grid system has a single agent, which is serving as containers for data, following simple rules of behavior and without knowing any global information. The strategy that agents follow includes which data to create replica and where the replica is locating. The local interactions and simple action between agents give a fairly optimal replication location solution globally. We carried the experiments using OptorSim for the EU Data Grid Testbed 1.

With the rapid growth of Internet technologies and easy access to information, the field of digital learning has stimulated innovation and diversified developments, and the emergence of guidance systems provide learners with adaptive learning paths that promote learning performance during learning processes. However, most guidance systems neglect to consider the level of difficulty, and recommended materials are proprietary in nature, and thus, do not fully utilize portfolio features of learners incorporated into personalized learning services when implementing personalized guidance. Therefore, this study proposed a guidance mechanism which utilizes the data of a learning portfolio to evaluate guidance parameters, and simultaneously considers information regarding the degree of relational reading, reading difficulty, and the average ability of learners, which can be entered into a genetic algorithm to construct a near optimal reading sequence during learning activities. Experiments were conducted to compare the free browsing reading mode without the guidance of a personalized reading path, as in most present systems. Based on the experimental results, this proposed guidance mechanism generates a high quality and concise learning path for individual learners, and the reading learning system results in an efficient and effective learning performance to promote learning motivation through appropriate learning paths.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7570-4; POD:978-1-4244-7567-4","10.1109/HUMANCOM.2010.5563359","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5563359","","Adaptive systems;Biological cells;Education;Learning systems;Materials;Portfolios;Vocabulary","Internet;computer aided instruction;information retrieval;natural languages","English language;English learning;English speaking countries;Internet;digital learning;guidance system;learning portfolio analysis;optimal reading sequence;personalized English reading;sequencing strategy","","0","","23","","","","11-13 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They can be employed to investigate complex natural phenomena, illustrate scientific concepts and generate special effects for entertainment purposes. Recently, we implemented an educational simulation framework based on particle systems that can be used to perform interactive virtual experiments involving complex physical laws. The positive feedback received from a pilot deployment of this framework motivated us to look for strategies to increase its scope. However, more complex and engaging simulations require the use of a larger number of geometric primitives (particles), which results in higher computational costs. To mitigate these costs, we resorted to the implementation of parallel techniques through the use of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard. In this paper, we describe these techniques and discuss the performance gains resulting from their application to the simulation algorithm that forms the core of our framework. These results were obtained through practical test cases which are also described in detail in this paper.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6830-0; POD:978-1-4244-6827-0","10.1109/HPCS.2010.5547147","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5547147","Education;application;parallel processing;particle system;simulation","Computational modeling;Context;Face;Gravity;Heuristic algorithms;Mathematical model;Trajectory","","","","1","","17","","","","June 28 2010-July 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous schemes are passive in nature and rarely consider these new characteristics. One of the most important and useful schemes especially in distributed databases is replication. Replication techniques are used to increase performance, availability, reliability and scalability of various types of distributed systems (e.g. p2p and data grid).

However, the traditional research is limited in top level of SoC. It does not really guarantee to improve the utilization of test resource of SoC and reduce the test time effectively in theory. This paper proposes that the focus of study will be extended to the IP core level. We can reduce the percentage of idle test time and achieve the minimum of test time in various IP cores through the establishment of scheduling strategy of balancing WSC (Wrapper Scan Chain) and the exchange ISC (Inter Scan Chain) heuristic algorithm. In this paper, we verify the scheduling strategy of balancing WSC in algorithm and reusability upon the ITC'02 benchmarks. The results show that the vast majority of percentage of idle test time is much less than 1% in the relationship set between the number m of balanced WSC and the test time T<inf>IP</inf> within each IP core. The results also can verify the importance of the research programme which is implemented in IP core level for improving the utilization of test resource and reducing the test time effectively in SOC.","","Electronic:978-1-84919-138-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5521966","Balancing WSC;Heuristic algorithm;Percentage of the idle test time;Scheduling","","","","","0","","","","","","7-9 Dec. 2009","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

The World Health Organization names this as a global epidemic identifying it as a big challenge to Information and Communication Technologies that can provide valuable tools to improve population health and well-being. In tandem with a strategy to provide information and education to individuals at risk, several projects across the world at national or regional levels are trying to address this challenge. The HEARTRONIC project developed an innovative system for prevention and early warning by continuous monitoring the heart conditions. This system is wearable by the patient, monitors and analyzes the ECG, and in the event of results that could predict a heart attack or stroke an alert message is sent to a server and then relayed to the responsible healthcare professional. The system uses ECG processing for automatic detection of abnormal functioning. First response actions are taken but the healthcare professionals are always in the control. The BIOMED-TEL project developed an innovative remote patient monitor that supervises 24 hours/7 days the main patient's vital signals in its environment. These signs are: SpO<inf>2</inf>, ECG one derivation, arterial blood pressure (BP), in conjunction with the body vibration acquired from chest zone and, glucose concentration in blood all above mentioned signs being relevant for the health patient status. With the correlation of the signals, the remote monitor is able to dynamical adapt his working regime from local storage of data acquired (as a classical holter) to continuously transmission of data acquired from patient to the hospital server, providing a quick time intervention of the health care professional in case of patient's alarm or emergency situation. Both projects are gathering efforts by comparing methods in order to assess the best practices and address the technical challenges that came across the development of such useful- - platforms.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6725-9; POD:978-1-4244-6724-2","10.1109/AQTR.2010.5520712","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5520712","","Biomedical monitoring;Cardiac disease;Cardiovascular diseases;Communications technology;Condition monitoring;Electrocardiography;Heart;Medical services;Patient monitoring;Wearable computers","","","","1","","20","","","","28-30 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the meaning of sustainable engineering education is broadened to include the sustainability of the individual engineer over his or her lifetime. This paper proposes that there are two fundamental questions to be answered, one about the learning process within the engineering student (i.e. What is the student doing when learning engineering?), and one about the engineering community which is seeking to make that learning most effective (i.e. What collaborative structures within the engineering education community will lead to the most effective cumulative progress, both in the education of individual students, and in the enterprise of engineering in its widest sense within the history of humanity?) This paper provides preliminary answers to these questions in line with human cognitive models, and demonstrates that ""understanding understanding"" across engineering disciplines allows elements of sustainability to be introduced in engineering education (examples are given from electrical and computer engineering.) These answers point to a framework for change in engineering education, one which extends to collaboration between engineering and economics, law, business, and other sectors.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6042-7; POD:978-1-4244-6040-3","10.1109/TEE.2010.5508815","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5508815","","Collaboration;Educational technology;Electrical engineering computing;Engineering education;Engineering profession;Engineering students;History;Humans;Knowledge engineering;Maintenance engineering","cognition;engineering education","computer engineering;electrical engineering;engineering community;engineering student;human cognitive model;learning process;sustainable engineering education","","1","","18","","","","6-9 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sensor networks in which energy is a limited resource, our goal is to minimize the distortion under certain power constraints. In this paper, for a given power constraints, equal power transmission strategy and the optimal power allocation strategy is considered. In the later, we first discuss the problem with only a sum power constraint, and then discuss the general case with both sum and individual power constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our results through numerical examples.

Through the connotation, nature, the strategies of autonomous learning implementation, together with the analysis of the management of autonomous learning mode, we are hoping to enable learners to grasp technical movements rapidly so as to improve the quality and the efficiency of the university of physical education. Autonomous learning is one of the essential targets for educating students in the field of modern education. Physical education is a bilateral activity with high practicality, the traditional methodology teaches students knowledge and technique through explanation and demonstration. For this reason, it is necessary to change the original unilateral passive way of learning and establish and form diversified learning mode aiming at fully mobilizing and exerting students' dominant role, as well as promote student' active and personalized learning and under the guidance of teachers. Therefore, the study and guidance as well as training towards autonomous learning should be an important part of university physical education. The ideal teaching of university physical education can enhance students' initiative and collaboration; and gradually bring about the transfor- ation of the teaching way of presenting the content, mode of learning and teacher-student interaction. Also it can make full use of information technological advantages to provide enriched educational resources and good venues for the students, as well as good guidance for students' life-long physical exercise.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5517-1; POD:978-1-4244-5514-0","10.1109/EDT.2010.5496393","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5496393","Initiative Learning Mode;The Teaching of University Physical Education","Application software;Computer applications;Computer networks;Computer science education;Ecosystems;Educational technology;Multimedia communication;Physics computing;Quality management;Space technology","computer aided instruction;educational courses","autonomous learning;computer aided physical education;information technological advantages;personalized learning;students initiative collaboration enhancement;students life long physical exercise;teacher student interaction;unilateral passive way of learning;university physical education teaching","","0","","5","","","","17-18 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed design takes account of the Type I & II characterization of more advanced learning objects that support active learning,better involve students in how things happen, provide an extensive range of acceptable responses, involve creative tasks and require extended periods of time to complete. The pair of projects described here involves developing 12 modular learning objects and supporting videos that address these worthwhile design characteristics and in addition embed the Canadian-based Critical Thinking Consortium's (TC)2 pedagogy of critical thinking. This is accomplished through our proposed Type III design by providing opportunities to engage in critical inquiry about content knowledge, involve students in critical dialogue, and encouraging critical reflection. In addition, the strategies offer the means for teaching other “tools for thought” such as the use of criteria for judgment, habits of mind, and thinking concepts such as attributing causal connections, drawing warranted inferences from statistical data, and interpreting images.

Based on the theories of education, suitable teaching strategy in the process of learning can improve learning efficiency. The self-directed learning theory emphasizes some properties including the free learning mode, personal learning style and self-decided learning pace. Similarly, the learning modes of ubiquitous learning are also free and convenient. As deduced here, it is suitable to apply the self-directed learning theory to ubiquitous learning environments. Therefore, this study discusses and integrates the self-directed learning strategy and the properties of ubiquitous learning to propose a Self-Seamless teaching (SST) strategy for ubiquitous learning environments. By using a mobile device, this Self-Seamless teaching strategy obviates many learning obstacles and improves the learning flexibility of traditional self-directed learning to improve learning efficiency.

The lack of understanding of tacit knowledge impedes the efforts of managing it as a source of competitive advantage. The research employs the grounded theory approach and data are gathered through semi-structured interviews incorporating the critical incidences technique. It is discovered that tacit knowledge of Malaysian academicians is knowledge internalized in their work practices, which is externalized through action strategies in fulfilling the seven performance indicators introduced by the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education. Three dimensions of tacit knowledge are discovered, namely the intellectual-affirmation tacit knowledge, self tacit knowledge and social tacit knowledge. Theoretical contributions from this study include a paradigm model of knowledge internalization and a theoretical model of tacit knowledge dimensions in Malaysian academia.

Motivated by human social learning, we believe that a transparent learning process can help guide the human teacher to provide the most informative instruction. We believe active learning is an inherently transparent machine learning approach because the learner formulates queries to the oracle that reveal information about areas of uncertainty in the underlying model. In this work, we implement active learning on the Simon robot in the form of nonverbal gestures that query a human teacher about a demonstration within the context of a social dialogue. Our preliminary pilot study data show potential for transparency through active learning to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the teaching process. However, our data also seem to indicate possible undesirable effects from the human teacher's perspective regarding balance of the interaction. These preliminary results argue for control strategies that balance leading and following during a social learning interaction.","2167-2121;21672121","Electronic:978-1-4244-4893-7; POD:978-1-4244-4892-0","10.1109/HRI.2010.5453178","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5453178","active learning;human-robot interaction;interactive learning;social robots;socially guided machine learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Chaos;Education;Educational institutions;Educational robots;Hospitals;Human robot interaction;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Uncertainty","human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence)","Simon robot;human social learning;human teachers;nonverbal gestures;pilot study data;social learning interaction;transparent active learning;transparent machine learning approach","","14","","23","","","","2-5 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, first, according to the unique characteristics caused by layered coding, we present four objectives that should be addressed by scheduling: throughput, layer delivery ratio, useless packets ratio, and subscription jitter prevention; then a three-stage scheduling approach LayerP2P is designed to request data, where the min-cost flow model, probability decision mechanism, and multiwindow remedy mechanism are used in Free Stage, Decision Stage, and Remedy Stage, respectively, to collaboratively achieve the above objectives. With the basic version of LayerP2P and corresponding experiment results achieved in our previous work, in this paper, more efforts are put on its mechanism details and analysis to its unique features; besides, to further guarantee the performance under sharp bandwidth variation, we propose the enhanced approach by improving the Decision Stage strategy. Extensive experiments by simulation and real network implementation indicate that it outperforms other schemes.

IMS is considered as the important way to solve the fixed-mobile convergence and the combination of multimedia services. P2P technology is introduced to solve the complicated structure and high OPEX of IMS, so as to promote the reliability and extensibility. However the introduction of P2P technology brings extra DHT messages and query delay that might exacerbate the performance of IMS applications. This paper proposes a new strategy called co-located DHT IMS where the IMS servers are as co-located as possible on the same DHT node host to reduce the messages necessary to exchange among IMS servers, as well as the number of physical servers involved on the process of registration and session establishment. Performance evaluation shows that the messages are reduced to and the reliability of system is improved when compared to traditional IMS. Thus the co-location DHT IMS is a feasible alternative for implementation in real system.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5681-9; POD:978-1-4244-5680-2","10.1109/IC4E.2010.84","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5432377","IP Multimedia Subsystem;Peer-to-Peer;Performance;Reliability;co-location","DH-HEMTs;Delay;Electronic learning;Laboratories;Network servers;Next generation networking;Peer to peer computing;Resource management;Routing;Telecommunication network reliability","IP networks;computer network reliability;multimedia communication;multimedia computing;peer-to-peer computing;performance evaluation","DHT messages;IMS performance;IMS reliability;IP multimedia subsystem;NGN;NGN technology;OPEX;P2P technology;colocation DHT IMS;extensibility;fixed mobile convergence;next generation network;performance evaluation;query delay","","0","2","9","","","","22-24 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To conquest these problems, there are two trends for mobile grid computing: a proxy-based mobile grid architecture and an agent-based mobile grid architecture. We focused on a proxy-based mobile grid architecture with IP-paging, which easily manage idle mobile devices and grid resource status information. In result, to support mobile grid services, we propose the IP-paging scheme based on the mobile grid computing framework.

Since the temperature of such hot air is low and varies frequently, it can usually causes either a low temperature condition of coal powder or an overload condition, leading to operational faults such as `powder-enwrapped balls' and `mill blockage' as well as unexpected termination of mill operation. Under such fault conditions the existing mill load control system cannot be put into use. To avoid the operational faults, an intelligent switching controller is developed and presented in this paper. This new controller consists of a coordinative controller for the mill load and the mill outlet temperature, a PI controller for the mill load, a rule reasoning based over load controller and a switching mechanism that is also based on rule reasoning. This method has been successfully applied to the mill load control of the pulverizing system for an alumina sintering process. It has been shown that such a control strategy can make the mill outlet temperature be within its required ranges and can guarantee the mill load to be within its range so as to ensure a maximum mill output.","0191-2216;01912216","Electronic:978-1-4244-3872-3; POD:978-1-4244-3871-6","10.1109/CDC.2009.5399644","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5399644","","Automation;Control systems;Cooling;Kilns;Load flow control;Milling machines;Powders;Temperature control;Temperature distribution;Valves","PI control;alumina;ball milling;coal;cooling;fault diagnosis;inference mechanisms;intelligent control;production engineering computing;pulverised fuels;sintering;temperature control;time-varying systems","PI controller;alumina sintering;coal powder;cooling clinker;coordinative controller;fault condition;hot air;intelligent mill load switching control;mill blockage;mill load control system;mill outlet temperature;powder-enwrapped balls;pulverizing system;rule reasoning","","2","","12","","","","15-18 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the two hybrid approaches, catalyst compositional models and catalytic reaction mechanism models are simultaneously constructed for correlating process data comprising values of input variables of catalyst compositional, operating conditions and output variables of performance of catalyst (catalyst selectivity and conversion). Next, in order to improve predictive accuracy and generalization ability of models, the structure and connection weights for ANN and three hyper-parameters for SVR are automatically optimized using chaos particle swarm optimization(CPSO). The CPSO possesses certain unique advantages over the commonly used GA and PSO optimization algorithms, which has high search efficiency, high precision and not the local optimum. The major advantage of the two hybrid strategies are that modeling can be conducted exclusively from the historic data wherein the detailed knowledge of process phenomenology (reaction mechanism, rate constants, etc.) is not required and difficult to get. Another advantage is that they have avoided the blindness and contingency of the traditional catalyst ""trial and error"" method. Finally, ANN-CPSO model and SVR-CPSO model were verified experimentally to be feasible, the forecasting values based on SVR-CPSO model were more close to the measured ones. The SVR-CPSO is a new soft computing methodology for heterogeneous catalysis modeling, which is more suitable for the non-linearity uncertainty, higher-dimension, chaos and small quantity of training data. The obtained results indicate that the SVR-CPSO model can be used as a promising alternative method for chemica- l process modeling.","","POD:978-1-4244-4754-1","10.1109/ICICISYS.2009.5357845","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5357845","chaotic particle swarm optimization;heterogeneous catalysis;modeling;neural networks;parameters optimization;support vector regression","Acceleration;Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Chaos;Costs;Input variables;Network synthesis;Neural networks;Particle swarm optimization;Predictive models","catalysis;chemical engineering computing;neural nets;particle swarm optimisation;regression analysis;support vector machines;syngas","ANN-CPSO model;STD process;SVR-CPSO model;artificial intelligence;catalyst compositional model;catalyst conversion;catalyst selectivity;catalytic reaction mechanism;chaotic particle swarm optimization;dimethyl ether;financial cost reduction;heterogeneous catalysis;industrialization synthesis;neural network;nonlinearity uncertainty;soft computing;support vector regression;syngas;temporal cost reduction","","0","","18","","","","20-22 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We assume that nodes in an ad hoc network behave as if they are in a competitive environment where each node seeks maximum delivery of its destined packets and minimum power consumption due to forwarding. The strategy makes use of data gathered from neighboring nodes that speaks about their behavior.

Researchers need to manage, assign metadata to, merge, sort, and query all of these data to support instructional decisions, research and accreditation. To address these needs we have constructed a database to support both data-driven instructional decision making and research in STEM education. We have built upon existing metadata standards to define an extensible educational metadata language (EdML) that enables assessments to be tagged based on taxonomies, standard psychometrics such as difficulty and discrimination, and other data to facilitate cross-study analyses. Once a collection of assessment data are available, faculty can examine their assessment data to evaluate historical trends, analyze the effectiveness of pedagogical techniques and strategies, or compare the performance of different teaching and assessment techniques within their course or across institutions.","0190-5848;01905848","POD:978-1-4244-4715-2","10.1109/FIE.2009.5350595","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5350595","Assessment Database;Infrastructure;Interdisciplinary;STEM Education Research","Accreditation;Data engineering;Databases;Decision making;Educational programs;Educational technology;Engineering management;Mathematics;Taxonomy;Technology management","educational computing;meta data","ABET accreditation;STEM education;assessment database;educational metadata language;educational research;science education;student assessment data","","0","","6","","","","18-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the Civil Engineering program at the USCGA, emphasis is placed on helping students make connections between theoretical fundamental principles and real engineering practice. It has been challenging to fit into our four year program of study the teaching of fundamental engineering principles, coverage of depth in four sub-fields of Civil Engineering, a large core curriculum required of all cadets, and an introduction to real-life engineering practice of industrial, community-based, and Coast Guard applications. To accomplish this, a strategy was adopted of infusing industrial and community relevance, and Coast Guard mission readiness into the curriculum through class assignments, field trips, guest speakers, capstone projects, community service, summer internships, and membership in professional organizations. Given this approach our graduates are able to most effectively serve the public as Civil Engineers, Coast Guard Officers, and community minded citizens.","0190-5848;01905848","POD:978-1-4244-4715-2","10.1109/FIE.2009.5350455","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5350455","Civil Engineering;Coast Guard;Community;Industrial Collaboration;Professional Organization","Civil engineering;Collaboration;Construction industry;Design engineering;Education;Educational institutions;Educational programs;Engineering management;Manufacturing industries;Military computing","civil engineering;educational courses;engineering education;professional aspects","United States Coast Guard Academy;civil engineering program;core curriculum;engineering students;graduate civil engineers;professional organizations","","1","","6","","","","18-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this architecture new roles to access points are attributed. A key point in this plan is to build clusters and choose supernodes. An important criterion for any choice making no doubt is the minimization of message overhead. In this Paper the influence of incorporating vehicles traffic in the organization of access points, add to connection of distant vehicles has been studied.

Furthermore, in QEA, the individuals in a population are represented by multistate gene quantum bits and this representation has a better characteristic of generating diversity in population than any other representations. In the individual's updating, the quantum rotation gate strategy is applied to accelerate convergence. The algorithm has the property of simple realization and flexible control.

With the conflict between huge amounts of streaming data and limited available bandwidth over the Internet seemingly irreconcilable, we observe 1) some channels demand disseminating rapidly, having no requirement for high presentation quality at receivers and 2) some channels expect better quality of service metrics such as bit rate and delay than others while bandwidth contention of multiple channels makes it difficult to realize. Existing proposals have not done enough work based on the two observations. In this paper, we propose DiffStream, a multi-channel dissemination strategy. In DiffStream, each channel disseminates partial streaming data instead of all, using MDC technology. Meanwhile, service differentiation is also achieved by treating different channels with varying priorities and regulating allocation of network resource to different channels in application layer. Furthermore, an extensive mechanism of vacant bandwidth preemption for improving bandwidth utilization is also raised. Experiments are constructed on NS2 and the results have demonstrated DiffStreampsilas effectiveness in achieving our design objectives.","2160-4908;21604908","POD:978-0-7695-3766-5","10.1109/GCC.2009.23","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5280158","low-delay;multimedia broadcast system;peer-to-peer;service differentiation","Bandwidth;Bit rate;Delay;Digital multimedia broadcasting;Multimedia communication;Multimedia systems;Quality of service;Streaming media;TV broadcasting;Web and internet services","Internet;information dissemination;multimedia systems;peer-to-peer computing","DiffStream;Internet;MDC technology;P2P network;multichannel multimedia content dissemination","","0","","15","","","","27-29 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Time stamps are attached to each communication packet of scene video, audio and environment information from the robot to remote operator's computer for display, which then sends back control decision or command of the right time stamps with the scene when needed. By allocating a memory buffer for current display and recent status even including video frames the robot recalls the environment with the event time stamps as searching index, which helps to estimate the exact robot position or operation.

In this paper, a novel and effective method is proposed to extending ontology instances from Chinese free text, which is achieved with classification using support vector machine (SVM). Firstly, classification features are extracted in terms of syntax and semantics from the training texts and the new texts based on the existed Chinese ontology. Then the ontology is turned into tree hierarchical structure which is used as the training and learning strategy of SVM classifier. Finally new ontology instances are extracted from the new texts according to the training results. The advantage of this method is that the semantic of ontology elements in texts is made full use of, and instances extraction and classification are completed in the identical procedure at same time. Experimental results show that the average accuracy of instances extraction and classification reached 86.6%, which is satisfactory.","","POD:978-0-7695-3619-4","10.1109/IUCE.2009.113","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5223033","SVM;instances extraction;ontology learning","Classification tree analysis;Computer science;Computer science education;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Learning systems;Ontologies;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Ubiquitous computing","ontologies (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","Chinese free text;Chinese ontology instance extension;SVM classifier;support vector machine;tree hierarchical structure","","2","","11","","","","15-16 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This pass/not-pass seminar, which meets once a week and is graded based solely on attendance, introduces the students to some of the most challenging problems faced by computer engineers in their daily professional endeavors and at the frontiers of research. To accomplish this feat in a nontechnical way, these problems are related to popular mathematical and logical puzzles. Each class session (60-75 min) begins by introducing the students to puzzles of a particular kind and letting them participate in formulating solutions. General solution methods for the puzzles are then discussed by the instructor, who then proceeds to demonstrate how the puzzles and their solution strategies are related to real technical challenges in computer engineering.

Mobile search is quite different from standard PC-based web search in a number of ways: (a) the user interfaces and I/O are limited by screen real estate, (b) key pads are tiny and inconvenient for use, (c) limited bandwidth and (d) costly connection fees. These limitations result in more navigational queries in the mobile search. Furthermore, user location, activities, preferences, and interaction history can also improve accuracy in determining relevance for mobile search. In the past, most personalized search algorithms are studied in the context of PC-based web search. Personalized mobile search should however play a bigger role at improving the user experiences. This paper focuses on the personalization strategies which explicitly and implicitly infer user search context at individual user level. We propose an architecture which collects user information (at mobile device and carrier network) and derives user intention in given situations. We show that personalized mobile search perform well for ambiguous queries and localized searches.","","POD:978-0-7695-3507-4","10.1109/CSIE.2009.718","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5170550","Context Awareness;Mobile Search;Personalized Search;User Profile","Computer science;Computer science education;Educational technology;Entropy;Hardware;History;Mobile computing;Navigation;Search engines;Web search","Internet;mobile computing","PC-based Web search;ambiguous queries;interaction history;localized search;mobile users;navigational queries;personalization strategies;personalized approach;personalized mobile search;personalized search algorithm;user information;user interface;user location;user search context","","2","1","15","","","","March 31 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been derived from embedding a heuristic based two level clustering algorithm within a multiple depot vehicle routing problem optimization framework. In logistic applications, customers have priority based on some logistic point of view. The priority levels of customers, affect distribution strategy specially in clustering level. In this research we have developed an integrated vehicle routing problem model using heuristic clustering method with Hopfield network. In the first phase of the algorithm, a high level heuristic clustering is performed to cluster customers serviced by a special depot. Next, a low level clustering is done for each depot to find clusters serviced by a single vehicle. Despite other optimization approaches, which solve case studies involving at most 25 nodes optimally, the proposed algorithm overcomes this limitation by a preprocessing stage by applying clustering on nodes. In this approach, a hierarchical hybrid procedure involving one heuristic and one neural network phases was developed.","1091-5281;10915281","POD:978-1-4244-3352-0","10.1109/IMTC.2009.5168448","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5168448","Clustering Algorithm;Hopfield;Neural Networks;Vehicle Routing Problem","Artificial neural networks;Clustering algorithms;Evolutionary computation;Heuristic algorithms;Impedance;Logistics;Neural networks;Particle swarm optimization;Routing;Vehicles","neural nets;optimisation;pattern clustering;traffic engineering computing","Hopfield network;distribution strategy;heterogeneous vehicle routing problem;heuristic based two level clustering algorithm;hierarchical hybrid procedure;integrated vehicle routing problem;multi level priority clustering NN based approach;multiple depot vehicle routing problem optimization framework;optimisation;two phase heuristic neural network combined algorithmic approach","","0","","67","","","","5-7 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The present article explores how such technologies are integrated into the classroom environment and also their influences, especially on post-secondary faculty development. This paper makes a case for the full implementation of ICT in university programs for the education of professionals, typically architects and civil engineers -- those who are learning to design in the marketplace of the future. The evidence that the potential influence of these technologies is more positive than negative is overwhelming if instructional strategies and techniques are adapted to the new technologies rather than the new technologies merely being grafted onto old methods. Discussion of the cultural and theoretical dimensions of using ICTs for professional education with a brief consideration of the effects of ICTs on faculty collegiality will be explored. The author concludes that whatever their limitations and difficulties, ICTs should be implemented integrally and extensively in the future education of design professionals.","","POD:978-0-7695-3653-8","10.1109/IACSIT-SC.2009.68","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5169323","Architecture;Design;Education;Educational Change;ICTs","Communications technology;Computer architecture;Computer science education;Continuing education;Cultural differences;Design engineering;Educational programs;Educational technology;Human computer interaction;Springs","architecture;civil engineering computing;computer aided instruction;continuing professional development;design engineering","architects;civil engineers;communication technologies;design professionals education;information technologies;instructional strategies;post-secondary faculty development;university programs","","0","","23","","","","17-20 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The facies acting as the constraint are based on known geological data and include depositional microfacies such as an extension direction and a ratio of width to thickness of microfacies. A strategy of the reservoir modeling controlled by facies is as follows: scale differences of reservoir controlled by hierarchy for multi-depth levels along vertical direction; for each depth level, plane zone differences of reservoir managed with nested structure.

The weakness using conventional PI controllers in the temperature control of the test room is analyzed. To improve the control performance over PI controllers, an adaptive fuzzy PI controller is developed. In the proposed control scheme, the increment of the PI controller parameters can be adjusted online by fuzzy rules according to the error of the controlled variable and the change of the error.

We discuss the design and delivery of a masters course in software requirements engineering (SRE) that is designed to overcome some of the issues that have caused the research-practice gap. By encouraging students to share their experiences in a peer learning environment, we aim to improve shared understanding between students (many of whom are current industry practitioners) and researchers (including academic staff members) to improve the potential for effective collaborations, whilst simultaneously developing the requirements engineering skill sets of the enrolled students.

Based on color and texture analysis, we identify the main barriers to wound healing, such as tissue non-viable, infection, inflammation, moisture imbalance, or edge non-advancing. This framework provides the infrastructure for preparing e-learning scenarios based on practice and real world experiences. We make experiments for wound healing simulation using various treatments and compare the results with experimental observations. Our experiments are supported by XML based databases containing knowledge extracted from previous wound healing experiences and from medical experts' knowledge. Also, we rely on new paradigms of the artificial intelligence for creating e-learning scenarios to be used in a context of active learning, for wound image understanding. To implement the e-learning tools, we use Java technologies for dynamic processes and XML technologies for dynamic content.

This method first divides the monitoring field into several sub-regions so that fusion nodes can collect data in their own parts respectively. Then fusion nodes use constraints-based mobile localization (CML) algorithm to calculate the location information of each sensor node. Finally a new maximum likelihood nearest neighbor (MLNN) algorithm is proposed to design optimal routes for fusion nodes.

So the research on structure and characters of networks will improve the search speed and lower the load of nodes. Though getting the shortest paths is the best choice, in a real network, it is impossible for a node to get global information. For example, there is not a node that has the whole network information in a peer-to-peer network. The shortest paths are available, but the cost, especially in a dynamical network, will be high. The paper first discusses the main characters of complex network and the existing searching strategies with local information, and then defines and analyzes maximum diffuse nodes. After evaluating the stability of maximum diffuse nodes in dynamical network, the paper designs searching strategy based on maximum diffuse principle. To validate the idea, we numerically simulate the most characteristic complex network model of Barabasi and Albert (BA model), and analyze the average path, the network average load and every nodepsilas load in different initial parameter values.

Moreover similarity between images is measured with an approximation of the earth moverpsilas distance (EMD), which quickly computes minimal-cost correspondences between sets of signatures. Experimental results in medical image database show that the proposed method in this paper is good enough to describe image information, and significantly improves the performance of the retrieval system.","","POD:978-0-7695-3557-9","10.1109/ETCS.2009.568","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4959289","blob;content-based image retrieval;earth mover's distance;thumbnails","Computer science education;Content based retrieval;Earth;Educational technology;Humans;Image databases;Image retrieval;Pixel;Space technology;Spatial databases","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;image segmentation","CBIR system;blob feature layer;content-based image retrieval systems;earth mover distance;global image layer;multistep queries strategy;raw pixel layer;semantic gap","","0","","10","","","","7-8 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To support effective learning, an e-learning system should be able to discover and make use of the semantic communities and the emerging semantic relations in a dynamic complex network of learning resources. Previous graph-based community discovery approaches are limited in ability to discover semantic communities. This paper first suggests the semantic link network (SLN), a loosely coupled semantic data model that can semantically link resources and derive out implicit semantic links according to a set of relational reasoning rules. By studying the intrinsic relationship between semantic communities and the semantic space of SLN, approaches to discovering reasoning-constraint, rule-constraint, and classification-constraint semantic communities are proposed. Further, the approaches, principles, and strategies for discovering emerging semantics in dynamic SLNs are studied. The basic laws of the semantic link network motion are revealed for the first time. An e-learning environment incorporating the proposed approaches, principles, and strategies to support effective discovery and learning is suggested.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2008.141","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4564467","Community discovery;Computer Applications;Education;Semantic Link Network.;e-learning;emerging semantics;semantic community","","Internet;computer aided instruction","Web resources;Web-based learning;World Wide Web;classification-constraint;e-learning system;hyperlink-based architecture;reasoning-constraint;rule-constraint;semantic link network","","157","","43","","","20080715","June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It is however difficult to learn, teach and assess. More must be understood about the skills involved in palpation. The present study compares the ability of practicing veterinarians and veterinary students to identify stiffness values. An absolute identification paradigm was used where a force-feedback device rendered virtual surfaces with 5 levels of stiffness within a ldquoclinically relevantrdquo range of 0.2 - 0.5 N/mm. The results from 12 veterinarians and 14 veterinary students show that the veterinarians performed significantly better than the students (p Lt 0.001). The mean information transfer was 0.97 bits (almost 2 perfectly-identifiable stiffness levels) for the veterinarians and 0.58 bits (1 correctly-identified stiffness level) for the students. However, neither group was able to reliably identify more than 2 levels of stiffness, indicating that the success of veterinarians in clinical practice probably relies on additional properties such as size, shape and texture. Our findings suggest that stiffness perception in the context of veterinary medicine is a learned clinical skill. Quantifying expert ability will help inform teaching methods and set targets for students. Similar psychophysical methods can also be used to monitor student performance throughout the learning process. Future work will examine the contributions of other object properties as well as motor strategies to palpation performance.","","POD:978-1-4244-3858-7","10.1109/WHC.2009.4810800","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4810800","comparison of experts and novices;haptics;palpation;stiffness identification;veterinary medical education","Breast cancer;Cows;Education;Educational institutions;Haptic interfaces;Medical diagnostic imaging;Medical simulation;Pregnancy;Psychology;Virtual reality","biomedical education;computer aided instruction;force feedback;haptic interfaces;medical diagnostic computing;rendering (computer graphics);teaching;touch (physiological);veterinary medicine;virtual reality","clinical skill learning;force-feedback device;haptic stiffness perception identification;mean information transfer;medical diagnosis;medical health profession;motor strategy;palpation;psychophysical method;teaching method;veterinary medicine;virtual reality haptic simulation;virtual surface rendering","","7","","26","","","","18-20 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in service-oriented u-learning environment, the dynamic features of resources and services may implicitly affect the recommendation results; meanwhile the other learners' preferences may also make a significant effect on the recommendation process. Based on these limitations, in our study, a multicontext-aware resource recommendation model and strategy for service-oriented ubiquitous learning environment is proposed with taking into consideration not only the services and learners' dynamic context information Finally, by presenting our prototype system and illuminating a typical scenario, we could show that our proposal can help learners obtain the proper resources to enhance the learning efficiency.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2021-6; POD:978-1-4244-2020-9","10.1109/ICPCA.2008.4783717","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4783717","Ubiquitous learning;multicontext;resource recommendation","Computer networks;Computer science;Computer science education;Context modeling;Context-aware services;Handheld computers;Pervasive computing;Proposals;Prototypes;Ubiquitous computing","computer aided instruction;information filters;ubiquitous computing","dynamic context information;multicontext-aware resource recommendation mechanism;service-oriented ubiquitous learning environment","","2","","11","","","","6-8 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two key contributions in this paper. The first contribution is that the proposed multi-class boosting algorithms utilize the common features which can be shared among different video event categories. Compared with the class-specific features, the entire set of shared features can provide more efficient and reliable representation to classify multiple video event categories.

Behavior of each individual is driven by temporal situation of the system and individualpsilas anticipation with respect to future decisions of other individuals, which can be calculated from individualspsila properties, such as strategy-sets, profit functions, beliefs about history information and future situation, and so on. Some learning rules, e.g. reinforcement learning, are also discussed for updating individualspsila properties during evolution of the system. Cellular Automata is employed in the frame to compute and observe the visualized long-term behaviors of the system at higher group level.

This paper presents simulated annealing algorithm applied to solve university course timetabling problem. The algorithm includes a repair process, which ensures that all infeasible timetables that may be produced during neighbourhood search process are rectified. The algorithm evaluates the violation of four soft constraints.

The education world is experiencing a change not just in terms of curriculum but also in terms of approaches to teaching and learning strategies. These changes in learning strategies from traditional to dynamic strategies based on the use of information technology create a learner centered learning environment. The most important role of an instructor in an online environment is a high degree of interactivity and participation. This means designing and conducting learning activities that result in engagement with the subject matter and with fellow learners using proper pedagogical approaches are very important.The development of e-Learning in the sciences in general and in mathematics in particular has not met the general expectations. The instructional design of the teaching of mathematics incorporates the elements on mathematical approaches, hierarchy of teaching, interactive multimedia, systematically designed and developed teaching and learning modules and sub modules, and holistic development of students OO (Object-Oriented) analysis and design techniques were developed to help in the modeling of business, the analysis of requirements and the design software. With the rapid growth of OO technology, a number of techniques in OO have been developed and integrated. UML was designed to bring together the best feature of a number of analysis and design techniques and notations to produce an industry standard.The unified modeling language (UML) is an effective and popular notation which is used to capture high-level designs for software systems. However, one aspect of software system design which is not typically captured in a UML document is a record of the likely (or desired) rate of performance of the major activities of the system. When this information is not included in the initi- - al UML description of a system it increases the likelihood that the performance of the software system being developed will not be considered until very late in the software development process.","2154-7491;21547491","POD:978-0-7695-3489-3","10.1109/ICACTE.2008.15","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4737126","","Education;Educational technology;Fellows;Information technology;Internet;Learning systems;Mathematics;Software design;Software systems;Unified modeling language","Internet;Unified Modeling Language;computer aided instruction;distance learning;mathematics computing;multimedia computing;natural sciences computing;object-oriented methods;software engineering;teaching","Internet technology;UML description;Unified Modeling Language;Web-based learning system;interactive multimedia;learner centered learning environment;mathematical instruction;mathematics teaching;object-oriented approach;pedagogical approach;software development process;software system","","0","","25","","","","20-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We used the likelihood ratio test, which was computed between the maximum probability of a result under two different hypotheses, i.e. null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis models, to verify the deviation degree and decide whether the student pronunciation is out-of-task. In SV part, the experimental results was significant and had 91.0% rate of F-score. The second part was applied to recognize the content of speech read by the speaker. The recognition net was built as a sausage shape with pronunciation confusion table corresponding to confusion error patterns. Then, the system could find out the wrong pronounced syllable for the appropriate feedback to correct the pronunciation of the users. In the stage of SI, the best detection rate had a F-score rate of 77.2%.","","CD:978-1-4244-2943-1; Paper:978-1-4244-2942-4","10.1109/CHINSL.2008.ECP.98","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4730352","","Computer errors;Computer industry;Computer networks;Education;Feedback;Hidden Markov models;Intelligent networks;Natural languages;Speech recognition;Testing","error detection;speech recognition;speech synthesis","computer assisted pronunciation teaching;pronunciation error detection;sentence verification;syllable identification","","1","","10","","","","16-19 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this article, we show the experimental results about the effectiveness of using JThreadSpy in undergraduate and graduate courses, explaining how it helps students to solve concurrency problems.

In order to get closer to such scenario, in this paper we present a case-based peer-to-peer multi-agent system for collaborative management of student models in ITSs. The goal of the system is twofold: first, to initialize the student model when a new student logs on the tutor system and second, to update the student model depending on the studentpsilas interaction with the system and exchanging this information with its peers. The quality of the system is evaluated in terms of its ability for searching similar cases (accuracy) tested under three different strategies.

Large classes provide unique challenges to the use of representations as the use of gestures and facial expressions in communication is hindered due to the size of classes. We found that when used concurrently Tablets and DyKnow supported representational practice facilitating student expression and increasing engagement in lectures. The technology further supported awareness and feedback within lectures and allowed co-construction of shared representations among faculty and students leading to a feedback based learning environment. We argue that there is some evidence that pen-based computing can transform large lecture classes to make them more inclusive and participatory.

E-learning systems are increasingly becoming an important part of the strategy for delivering online and flexible e-learning. The main advantage of e-learning is the opportunity for students to interact electronically with each other and their teachers during forums, on discussion boards, by e-mail and in chat rooms. Though recognizing that the world at large will continue to use terminology in different and often ambiguous ways, the term of virtual learning environments (VLE) is used to refer to the on-line interactions of a variety of kinds that take place between learners and instructors. There are many pieces of software available that provide VLE systems, both commercial and open source software (OSS).

The grid is mainly comprised by PCs (personal computers) which in practice will not provide replica information to the grid replica catalogue because the frequent updating operation caused by task execution will consume lots of bandwidth and computing resources. Furthermore file replacement will occur if the storage element has insufficient storage space. Considering with these problems, the Replica Prediction Guide (RPG) task scheduling algorithm is introduced. By maintaining a Replica Prediction List (RPL), a Task Queue Wait Time Queue (TQWTQ) and the total size of working directory for each storage element without holding replica information, the grid scheduler can track the data sharing pattern between a task and replica content of a host, also the task wait time can be predicted by checking TQWTQ. More practically, the RPL can predict the replica contents of a machine even different file replacement strategies actually used on it. The simulation results show that the RPG algorithm has better performance than Queue Access Cost used in OptorSim and Storage Affinity algorithm when a set of tasks are submitted in high frequency.","2160-4908;21604908","POD:978-0-7695-3449-7","10.1109/GCC.2008.104","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4662861","Scheduling;distributed systems;grid computing;image visualization","Bandwidth;Biomedical computing;Biomedical engineering;Computer science education;Frequency;Grid computing;Microcomputers;Personal communication networks;Processor scheduling;Scheduling algorithm","file organisation;grid computing;microcomputers;peer-to-peer computing;queueing theory;scheduling;task analysis","data sharing;file replacement;grid environment;personal computers;replica catalogue;replica information;replica prediction guide task scheduling;task queue wait time queue;task-submitting circumstance","","0","","18","","","","24-26 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the distribution of IP addresses is highly nonuniform, which results in many scans wasted on invulnerable addresses. Inspired by the theory of good point set, this paper proposes a new scanning strategy, referred to as good point set scanning (GPSS), for worms. Experimental results show that GPSS can generate more distinct IP addresses and less unused IP addresses than the permutation scanning. Combined with group distribution, a static optimal GPSS is derived. Since the information can not be easily collected before a worm is released, a self-learning worm with GPSS is designed. Such worm can accurately estimate the underlying vulnerable-host distribution when a sufficient number of IP addresses of infected hosts are collected. We use a modified Analytical Active Worm Propagation (AAWP) to simulate data of Code Red and the performance of different scanning strategies. Experimental results show that once the distribution of vulnerable hosts is accurately estimated, a self- learning worm can propagate much faster than other worms.","2376-6492;23766492","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2202-9; POD:978-1-4244-2201-2","10.1109/IWCMC.2008.17","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4599916","","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Computer science education;Computer worms;Information analysis;Information security;Internet;Performance analysis;Telephony","IP networks;Internet;invasive software;set theory;telecommunication security","IP address;Internet;analytical active worm propagation;good point set scanning strategy;group distribution;self-learning worm analysis;target vulnerable host distribution","","0","","14","","","","6-8 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This system is wearable by the patient, monitors and analyzes the heart beat, and in the event of results that could predict a heart attack or stroke an alert message is sent to a server and them relayed to the responsible healthcare professional. The system uses EGC processing for automatic detection of abnormal functioning. First response actions are taken but the healthcare professionals are always in the control loop and can cancel or impose actions other than the ones decided by the system. System integration is starting and first trials are planned. Besides validating systems functionalities, these trials will allow to calibrate the sensitivity of the algorithms: high sensitivity may cause numerous false positives, while low sensitivity may result in misdiagnosis of potentially life threatening conditions.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2577-8; POD:978-1-4244-2576-1","10.1109/AQTR.2008.4588878","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4588878","","Biomedical monitoring;Cardiac arrest;Cardiac disease;Cardiovascular diseases;Communications technology;Condition monitoring;Heart beat;Medical services;Patient monitoring;Wearable computers","diseases;electrocardiography;health care;medical signal detection;patient care;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;wearable computers","EGC processing;HEARTRONIC project;World Health Organization;automatic detection;cardiovascular diseases;continuous monitoring;control loop;coronary diseases;global epidemic;healthcare professional;heart attack;heart beat;heart conditions;information and communication technology;patient monitoring;population health;system integration;wearable computing","","4","","10","","","","22-25 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We score each sentence by computing its similarity and Skip-Bigram co-occurrence with query. These two features can measure the query-relevance from content and structure respectively. Then, we re-score the sentences using the information density feature gained from a text graph which can provide position information. And finally, we adopt MMR for sentence extracting. Experimental results indicate that this method is effective in capturing important sentences.

While in jail, mental conditions may worsen due to mistreatment from fellow inmates and lack of resources needed to provide appropriate mental health treatment. Worsened conditions contribute to future unlawful behavior and re-arrest, repeating the cycle. The Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) was developed to alleviate this problem by helping prevent people with mental illness from entering the jails in the first place. Through specialized training and other education programs offered to law enforcement officers, CIT aims to improve mental health treatment as well as interactions with the law for those experiencing effects of a mental illness. The CIT program needs to provide evidence that its programs in Charlottesville benefit the community as planned. This project is focused on designing and implementing a data collection and evaluation strategy for the Charlottesville CIT. Using the systems methodology, the authors developed a data collection system that collects information specified as necessary in evaluating the effectiveness of CIT and its programs. The system requires individuals from 6 agencies to submit monthly datasheets to the CIT coordinator. A macro-driven Excel tool is then used by the CIT coordinator to integrate these datasheets and calculate CIT performance metrics.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2366-8; POD:978-1-4244-2365-1","10.1109/SIEDS.2008.4559724","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4559724","","Computational Intelligence Society;Data engineering;Design engineering;Educational programs;Engineering students;Fellows;Law enforcement;Mental disorders;Systems engineering and theory;USA Councils","criminal law;health care;medical computing;patient treatment;psychology;public administration","Crisis Intervention Team;criminal justice system;data collection system;macrodriven Excel tool;mental condition;mental health treatment;mental illness;unlawful behavior","","0","","3","","","","25-25 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our study, we consider the regenerative relays in which the decisions to cooperate are based on a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) threshold and consider the impact of the possible erroneously detected and transmitted data at the relays. We derive the end-to-end bit-error rate (BER) for binary phase-shift keying modulation and look at two power allocation strategies between the source and the relays in order to minimize the end-to-end BER at the destination for high SNR.

The current talk reports on work that starts with a pressing social problem - the problem of maximizing equity and excellence in K-12 education - and one strategy for addressing this problem - the development of mobile, wirelessly connected tools to support classroom learning. It mentions the development and use in real classrooms of two suites of such tools (one for middle school math and one for 5-11 th grade science). The practice of using these wirelessly connected, mobile devices raised important theoretical issues about the nature of coordination and the computational support for coordination. We have been using tuple spaces (a framework for allocating work between parallel distributed actors) to build systems that explore the opportunistic control of the individual over their own actions, socially emergent negotiation of system goals and coordinative practices, and the relationship between content and coordination. These control structures and the contribution of the machine as compared to human participants are better described by analogy to playground games than to work situations. This analogy (along with the values it presupposes) is at variance with the object world of software engineers, which foregrounds the capabilities of the machine rather than the situation of use.","","POD:0-7695-2942-9","10.1109/PLT.2007.31","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4488853","","Control systems;Educational institutions;Humans;Mobile computing;Pressing","computer aided instruction;mobile computing;mobile radio","K-12 education;classroom learning;computational coordination support;tuple spaces;wireless mobile devices","","0","","","","","","4-5 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the first is executed by computing semantic similarity between the sentence and the query, and the other is executed by using semantic graph. Then these two kinds of features are blessed to score each sentence. At last with the help of MMR for reducing redundancy, we get the summary.

Here, the needs identified by the educators who are to use the created environment are discussed. Those needs have led to the design of the environment, including physical spaces, tools and technologies. Our results indicate that it is now possible to design a highly useful environment for distributed education at a much lower cost-to-quality ratio than only a few years ago. Such a system may be created in a way that allows teachers to learn to use the environment self sufficiently. Thereby, the need for support staff is greatly diminished. The results indicate that the use of appropriate methods and tools lets teachers work in a distributed environment in a way that closely resembles their normal way of work in a teaching situation.

Although the shape structures can be very different from frame to frame, we propose to derive a unique kinematic structure by way of clustering nodes of a graph, based on the fact that they are partly coherent to a certain extent of time series. The only assumption we make is that the human body can be approximated by an articulated body with certain numbers of end-points and branches.

Ridgelet, a new analytic tool, has the ability to describe linear or super-plane singularities. The ridgelet transform can be described as the application of the wavelet transform to the coefficients of the Radon transform. In this paper, on the basis of this theory, two compression strategies for compression of cubic data are examined. The first strategy is the concept of 2D ridgelet compression applied to each slice of the cubic data and the second one is the concept of 3D ridgelet compression applied to the entire cubic data directly. In our strategies, the Radon transform is realized numerically by parallel projection (2D) or cone beam projection (3D), and the wavelet transform is realized by the lifting wavelet transform. These strategies have the following characteristics: embedded coding and strong robustness, all of which can be seen in the results of the numerical experiments.","2158-5695;21585695","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1066-8; POD:978-1-4244-1065-1","10.1109/ICWAPR.2007.4420685","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4420685","compression;cubic data;embedded coding;ridgelet;robustness;wavelet","Computed tomography;Data compression;Discrete wavelet transforms;Image coding;Notice of Violation;Pattern analysis;Pattern recognition;Robustness;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet transforms","Radon transforms;data compression;wavelet transforms","Internet transfer;Radon transform;cone beam projection;cubic data compression;embedded coding;parallel projection;ridgelet application;wavelet transform","","0","","13","","","","2-4 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Remote Sensing plays an important role in the large-scale, real-time, multi-spectral data acquisition. But there are still some problems when Remote Sensing data are applied in the actual farm production and management, which result in that precision agriculture's advantages are limited, so finding the solution of data acquisition for precision agriculture based on remote sensing becomes very necessary. In this paper, the NPP, NDVI, LAI etc are retrieved from remote sensing data, the field investigation data are also obtained. We set up a decision-making system based on CNCS (central neural control system), which is composed of several module such as data updating, data editing, decision-making supporting.

Thus, the proposal included a learning contract that must be signed for all the pupils enrolled on this particular group. Both active teaching-learning methods and additional assessment strategies were applied to achieve the objectives, defined in terms of competences. Among the new assessment methods, it may be quoted: a practical-based work, a hands-on exam carried out at the laboratory and the student's portfolio. This approach intended encouraging the pupils' motivation as well as to get a continuous and personal trace of their real learning processes.

In this mode of instruction, the Chinese teaching assistants conducted interactive classes using both the video materials and a classroom interaction system (Classroom Presenter) for electronically supported student activities. These activities were done using a system of networked Tablet PCs, which allowed the students to electronically submit their work to the instructor, and enabled the instructor to display student submissions as well as ink on the lecture slides.

The limited classroom time with students over the summer forces the design of the curriculum to be concise and comprehensive, yet engaging. The curriculum includes basic and intermediate courses with content in Computer Programming, Web Design, Computer Systems, and Mathematics. This work in progress describes the preliminary design and implementation processes and focuses on what should be taught and to a lesser degree the pedagogy. TLI provides an avenue for students to learn about the vast scope of Computer Science, educational and career opportunities, in addition to obtaining transferable knowledge and skills. The curriculum is assessed by an external evaluation team that will collect, analyze and report student-identified competency, student perceptions and interests, as well as actual achievement levels.

Their task consisted in producing a 1-1.5 hours learning exercise on usability testing for students present in a classroom, with the possibility of using a collection of educational material, repositories and external sources. They were videotaped while working and interviewed after the experiment. The principal results are as follows: both groups of subjects often repurposed exercises and others' educational materials placed at their disposal rather than simply reusing them; both groups reused others' material, either totally or partially, and in the latter case, they reused the structure, the content, or the concept; both groups produced exercises comprising more than one educational activity; and the exercises produced by subjects working asynchronously displayed a content-driven strategy while those produced by subjects working synchronously displayed an activity/practice-driven strategy.

The rerouting-based anonymous communication protocol building on the structured Peer-to-Peer network is put forward in this paper. Resorting to the self-organizing, structured overlay network, the anonymous strategy does not need a administrant node. Because of the opening character of overlay network, the relation on the expected value of rerouting path length and forward probability, and the relation on the degree of anonymity and the number of malicious nodes are analyzed in this paper. Moreover, the probability, which malicious nodes find the initiator, is increasing with the rounds which the initiator builds the rerouting path. The calculation result demonstrates that descending forward probability makes the expected value of rerouting path length decreases distinctly, therefore limits the communication delay.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1386-7; POD:978-1-4244-1385-0","10.1109/ISITAE.2007.4409353","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4409353","Anonymous Communication;Overlay network;Rerouting","Buildings;Computer networks;Data communication;Fault tolerance;Information security;Internet;Peer to peer computing;Performance analysis;Protection;Routing","Internet;peer-to-peer computing;probability;protocols;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","fault tolerant substrate;forward probability;rerouting-based anonymous communication protocol;structured peer-to-peer overlay network","","0","","8","","","","23-25 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has complex control target with less manipulate variables than controlled variables, and the boundary conditions vary frequently and severely during operation. Most rotary kilns are still under manual control such that the burning status cannot be maintained stable, the product quality is hard to be kept consistent and energy consumption remains at high level. To deal with this problem, this paper presents a pattern-based hybrid intelligent control strategy. Because of the vital importance of the burning zone temperature, several patterns representing kiln operation conditions are distinguished through burning zone temperature pattern recognition. A MIMO supervisory fuzzy controller is designed to address qualitative decoupling among controlled variables in the normal regulation phase, and a human mimic controller is employed to avoid overshoot when process large disturbance happens in the abnormal regulation phase. The two controllers are switched by the pattern recognition model, with their parameters tuned also by the pattern recognition model. This pattern-based hybrid intelligent control approach has been implemented in DCS and successfully applied in an alumina rotary kiln. Satisfactory results have shown that the adaptability and performances of the control system have been improved effectively, and remarkable benefit has been obtained.","1085-1992;10851992","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0443-8; POD:978-1-4244-0442-1","10.1109/CCA.2007.4389201","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4389201","","Boundary conditions;Couplings;Energy consumption;Human factors;Intelligent control;Kilns;MIMO;Nonlinear systems;Pattern recognition;Temperature","MIMO systems;aluminium manufacture;control engineering computing;fuzzy control;intelligent control;kilns;multivariable control systems;nonlinear control systems;pattern recognition;production engineering computing","MIMO supervisory fuzzy controller;alumina rotary kiln;burning zone temperature pattern recognition;energy consumption;human mimic controller;multivariable nonlinear system;pattern-based hybrid intelligent control;product quality;rotary kiln process","","3","","10","","","","1-3 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The authors have developed an interactive APL power-flow demonstrator according to a different philosophy. All calculations are performed upon a small two-generator system which contains all the essential components of a large practical power network. The network itself, with all its parameters, is shown graphically on the CRT screen or by the printer, and the displayed parameters are updated automatically as calculations are performed. Using this small network, students are able to observe the effects of changes in network parameters and operating strategies upon the voltages, currents, and power flows. A major use of this program is to enable the student to ultimately learn how to adjust certain operating parameters in order to cause others to be within specified tolerances.

A paradigm shift has emerged which ranges from single silicon devices to a multitude of materials and integrated systems. The research approach has evolved accordingly: from mono-disciplines to multi-disciplinary research involving physics, mathematics, chemistry, medicine, biotechnology, mechanics, and micro-nano electronics. The development and integration of heterogeneous technologies at the interface of nanotechnology, biotechnology and information & communication technologies towards miniaturised, multifunctional and cost-effective systems is being attracting great interest and effort, world wide. In particular, under the research and technology development framework programme (FP) 6 of the European Union [2002-2006], the Information Society Technologies program (1ST), micro-nano systems sector2, invested more than 100 meuro through academic and industrial cooperative projects, striving a balance between technological innovation (discovery) and integration into functional systems that can be plugged into real-life environment (applied R&D). The group of EC-funded projects on Micro-Nano-Bio Convergence Systems, ""so-called"" MNBS, is made by projects developing systems that use a vast array of technologies to integrate across traditional boundaries between the micro-nano- bio, and info worlds, enabling a wide range of applications from health care to food quality monitoring. The group could be divided, at its current stage, in two main categories: - Biosensors, DNA & protein arrays, biochips, lab on chip, and other miniaturised systems enabling point of care, in vitro molecular diagnosis, and biological analysis. Such projects develop and integrate components and modules e.g. microfluidics, biosamples preparation, sensing, detection, signal processing and data reading/handling. Applications in biomedicine and healthcare include e.g. early cancer - - diagnostics, prognosis and disease recurrence (e.g. breast, prostate, lung and colorectal), malaria detection, diabetes monitoring and deep vein thrombosis early detection. Another promising research line is on wearable biochemical sensing though sweat analysis, targeting applications such as sports and human performance, obesity and wound healing. - Body sensors, implantable systems, endoscopic probes, active electrodes and other miniaturised systems interacting with the human body to enable several applications e.g. drug delivery, repairing of vital functions and diagnosis. These projects develop and integrate components and systems e.g. sensors, actuators, micro/nano electrodes, power supply, signal & data processing, and wireless telecommunication modules to fulfil predefined applications requirements. Such examples are smart implant sensors and systems e.g. glaucoma & retina sensor, intra-cranial pressure sensor, cochlear implant, functional electrical stimulation for limp motion, activity monitor, sphincter sensor and biosensor for blood glucose monitoring. Other examples include endoscopic probes (for gastrointestinal tumor recognition and therapy), active neural electrode system for stimulation and recording of brain activity and disorders; drug delivery through intraoral microsystem; non invasive Sensors and systems for attention, stress, vigilance and sleep on the go. The cluster aims at, promoting excellence and relevance within the community, building critical mass of activities with clear visibility and societal impact, as well as identifying possible synergies and common interest topics for further collaboration e.g. packaging, manufacturing, common infrastructure, standardization, ethics, testing-validation, market analysis & roadmapping, as well as dissemination, awareness and education.

Co-registration of brain SPECT and MR images has been used extensively in a number of clinical applications. The surface-based method and the mutual-information-based method are two major co-registration methods. The former aligns two volumetric images based on the cost function derived from brain surfaces, whereas the latter matches two volumetric images based on maximizing the mutual information (MI) between intensities of two images. To the best of our knowledge, these two methods have neither been compared, nor conjointly used to register the brain SPECT and MR images. Simulation results show that the surface-based method is more robust to the large deviation of initial guesses and computationally efficient, while the Mi-based method provides better precision. The complementary features of these two methods motivated us to propose a hybrid strategy in which the surface-based method is employed to rapidly achieve a rough alignment followed by the Mi-based method for fine tuning the results. Results from simulations suggested that only two iterations of MI calculation were required after surface-based registration and thereby lots of computation efforts can be saved.","1094-687X;1094687X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0788-0; POD:978-1-4244-0787-3","10.1109/IEMBS.2007.4352428","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4352428","","Brain;Computational modeling;Cost function;Magnetic resonance;Magnetic resonance imaging;Mutual information;Registers;Rough surfaces;Single photon emission computed tomography;Surface roughness","biomedical MRI;brain;image registration;medical image processing;single photon emission computed tomography","MRI;SPECT;brain imaging;cost function;image co-registration;magnetic resonance images;mutual-information-based methods;single photon emission computed tomography;surface-based methods;volumetric images","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique;Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon","0","","10","","","","22-26 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In fact, the underlying conceptual framework intends to investigate to what extent we can improve the children's understanding of narrative through the introduction of simple game-like tasks that address primitive components of narrative. The game has strong analogies with the concrete, physical world. Our design approach, following our knowledge regarding this particular group of learners, was to 'keep things simple', introducing features only if necessary to provide each individual child with a focussed and enjoyable game, from which that particular child may learn about, or absorb, (or become more familiar with) primitive components of narrative. In this paper we concentrate on issues of reward, feedback, and opportunities for reasoning (about the task and/or their own performance) provided by software. We present results from the first 7 visits of an ongoing longitudinal study involving 6 children each with a diagnosis of autism. We consider the children's apparent engagement with TouchStory, and in particular, we focus on the strategy each child adopts and consequent feedback from the software. This analysis prompted us to further reflect on the specificities of this group of children and the challenges to create supportive learning environments.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1116-0; POD:978-1-4244-1115-3","10.1109/DEVLRN.2007.4354045","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4354045","Autism;interaction;narrative;software design","Adaptive systems;Autism;Computer science;Computer science education;Concrete;Feedback;Humans;Robots;Software design;Software performance","computer aided instruction;medical computing;paediatrics","TouchStory;autism;feedback design;software game;supportive learning environments","","4","","20","","","","11-13 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile tools immerse in the learning environment and surround the educators, the students and the environment they operate in. These tools can be directly integrated in classroom activities in order to enhance and promote new ways of teaching and learning. The purpose of this research work is to evaluate the viability of integrating mobile technology into the teaching and learning processes in higher education from the faculty perspective. The study focuses on faculty members working in private colleges in Cyprus, and is guided by the following research objectives: to determine the general knowledge of faculty members on mobile technologies and learning, to explore the perceptions of educators regarding mobile technology integration, to determine the current level of educators' (from different disciplines) knowledge on mobile technologies, to measure the degree in which educators are willing to integrate mobile devices in their classroom practices, to identify the factors that influence mobile technology integration in education, and to propose a strategy for the introduction of m- learning integration. To address the above, a mixed method approach is employed [1, 2]. The study makes use of both quantitative and qualitative data. The purpose of this mixed method is to use ""qualitative results to assist in explaining, interpreting and further examining the findings of the quantitative study"" [1]. The results of this work allow for determining the viability of integrating mobile devices in education from the educators' perspective.

In this paper, a role-based intelligent mobile care system with alert mechanism in chronic care environment is proposed and implemented. The roles in our system include patients, physicians, nurses, and healthcare providers. Each of the roles represents a person that uses a mobile device such as a mobile phone to communicate with the server setup in the care center such that he or she can go around without restrictions. For commercial mobile phones with Bluetooth communication capability attached to chronic patients, we have developed physiological signal recognition algorithms that were implemented and built-in in the mobile phone without affecting its original communication functions. It is thus possible to integrate several front-end mobile care devices with Bluetooth communication capability to extract patients' various physiological parameters [such as blood pressure, pulse, saturation of haemoglobin (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and electrocardiogram (ECG)], to monitor multiple physiological signals without space limit, and to upload important or abnormal physiological information to healthcare center for storage and analysis or transmit the information to physicians and healthcare providers for further processing. Thus, the physiological signal extraction devices only have to deal with signal extraction and wireless transmission. Since they do not have to do signal processing, their form factor can be further reduced to reach the goal of microminiaturization and power saving. An alert management mechanism has been included in back-end healthcare center to initiate various strategies for automatic emergency alerts after receiving emergency messages or after automatically recognizing emergency messages. Within the - - time intervals in system setting, according to the medical history of a specific patient, our prototype system can inform various healthcare providers in sequence to provide healthcare service with their reply to ensure the accuracy of alert information and the completeness of early warning notification to further improve the healthcare quality. In the end, with the testing results and performance evaluation of our implemented system prototype, we conclude that it is possible to set up a complete intelligent health care chain with mobile monitoring and healthcare service via the assistance of our system.","1089-7771;10897771","","10.1109/TITB.2006.888701","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4300837","Alert;Bluetooth;Java programming;mobile care;mobile phone;ubiquitous","Biomedical monitoring;Bluetooth;Condition monitoring;Data mining;Medical services;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Patient monitoring;Prototypes;Signal processing","Bluetooth;diseases;health care;knowledge based systems;mobile computing;mobile radio;patient care;patient monitoring;telemedicine","Bluetooth communication;alert mechanism;arrhythmia;back-end healthcare center;chronic care environment;chronic diseases;emergency messages;front-end mobile care devices;health education;healthcare quality;healthcare service;hypertension;information analysis;information storage;information transmission;mobile care system;mobile phone communication;patient monitoring;physiological parameters;physiological signal recognition algorithm;professional medical care;role-based intelligent mobile care system;signal extraction devices;wireless transmission","Cellular Phone;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography, Ambulatory;Feasibility Studies;Heart Diseases;Humans;Mobile Health Units;Pilot Projects;Remote Consultation;Taiwan","107","","16","","","","Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Student success is important to retention, and one of the premises of this study is that meeting the challenges of demanding curricula often requires more than innate intelligence. To explore this assumption, two intrapersonal variables rarely studied in the computing field were measured: coping strategies and emotional intelligence as contributors to within-major grade point average (GPA). Based on data collected from 613 upper-level undergraduate students enrolled at multiple universities in the USA, the effects of coping strategies and emotional intelligence on academic performance were tested, with self-efficacy (SE) used as a covariate. The results indicate that SE is related to academic success for computing students. Emotional intelligence does predict SE for computing students. However, computing and noncomputing majors differed significantly on emotional intelligence and the ldquoaccommodationrdquo coping strategy. Further, the ldquochange the situationrdquo coping strategy was directly linked to academic success for noncomputing students, but not for computing students.

Then units from a new text corpus which will be the source of target script are inserted into the trees. The sentence selection strategy is a combination of coverage of major tree nodes and frequent context vector clusters. Experiment is carried out by collecting a Beijing Olympics related corpus taking advantage of an existing domain-unspecified speech corpus and supplementary domain-specified text.

In the current era of information technology, the Internet and other electronic media are extensively used for its potential to improve educational experiences for all the stakeholders: students, researchers and teachers. As people are free to find and use wealth of information, in many of the cases, they are tempted to adopt plagiarism through copy-and-paste instead of assistance. Over decades, a variety of methods of plagiarism detection and prevention have been proposed such as a) plagiarism detection using electronic tools [1], [2], [3], b) improving learning and teaching ethics by conducting specialized courses, c) penalizing persons responsible for their guilt, d) creating awareness about copyright act and cyber law, etc. None of them alone could eliminate the temptation of practicing plagiarism by the students, researchers and surprisingly even by the teachers. Thus comprehensive plans and strategies are necessary to combat plagiarism for effective rendering of education. In this paper, we identified some impacts of plagiarism on learning, teaching and research. In doing so, we interviewed (both open and close ended) students, teachers and researchers from six universities in Bangladesh [4]. The sampled data is analyzed to identify most widely practiced means [5], [6] of plagiarism by three target groups (i.e. students, researchers and teachers) and how they are being currently dealt with by the authority. Finally, strategies are suggested for combating plagiarism, which are a) inclusion of some articles on plagiarism in the existing copyright act and cyber law, or creating a separate plagiarism act, b) practice of code of ethics- - against plagiarism at HEIs through active work-groups to monitor and combat plagiarism, c) including plagiarism in the secondary and undergraduate syllabuses, research and development guidelines for conducting thesis and research papers and arranging seminars and lectures to stop plagiarism, etc.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0406-1; POD:1-4244-0405-3","10.1109/ITHET.2006.339791","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141654","Combating plagiarism;Educational ethics;Higher education;Plagiarism","Data analysis;Education;Educational institutions;Ethics;Guidelines;Information technology;Internet;Monitoring;Plagiarism;Research and development","Internet;educational computing","Internet;electronic media;higher education institution;plagiarism detection;research manuscripts;submitted assignments;teaching materials;unethical practices","","4","","11","","","","10-13 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

What has been the conventional teacher-centred approach is now seeing a shift into one which emphasises on student-centred learning. Traditional educational content can now be transformed into interactive multimedia content by using authoring packages. It has enabled the teacher to innovate his/her instructional design by presenting the educational content in an interactive and multi- sensory manner rather than the traditional single media format. This infusion of multimedia into teaching and learning has altered instructional strategies in educational institutions. Hence, with the advent of this pervasive information technology, many colleges and universities, including those in Malaysia, are currently gearing their teaching and learning towards one which uses multimedia technology to enhance the student's learning process. With the availability of the devices such as the CD and Internet, in particular the World Wide Web, interactive learning instructions can be delivered to the learners in an asynchronous learning environment. The purpose of the research is to do a comparative study on the impact on student learning when interactive multimedia educational content is delivered to the second year students of the Film & Animation course of Multimedia University via the CD and the Web. A set of instructional materials were developed, implemented and the learners' perception and attitudes towards the use of these multimedia learning instructions recorded. Furthermore, the changing roles and the relationships between the learner and teacher in this interactive learning environment were studied. Therefore, an enhanced model of Gagne's Conditions of Learning was created in the context of interactive learning will be presented in this paper.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0406-1; POD:1-4244-0405-3","10.1109/ITHET.2006.339782","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141645","CD and Web;Interactive;Multimedia;Student-centred","Animation;Context modeling;Education;Educational institutions;Information technology;Internet;Joining processes;Multimedia systems;Packaging;Web sites","computer aided instruction;educational aids;educational courses;further education;multimedia computing","Film & Animation course;Malaysia;Multimedia University;authoring packages;conditions of learning;educational institutions;higher education;innovative teaching;interactive learning;interactive multimedia content;multimedia learning instructions;pervasive information technology;student-centred learning","","6","","17","","","","10-13 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, many organizations are unable to get the results they expect when they introduce knowledge management into their organizational business processes. This paper suggests a dynamic model of knowledge management for higher education development, based on the analysis of many case studies of knowledge management in knowledge intensive organizations and the Monash task-based KM approach. This has been successfully implemented in recent years. The purpose of this model is to increase knowledge efficiency and to enhance organizational knowledge learning and sharing for discovery and innovation of new knowledge, which differentiates an organization from its competitors. This model includes six knowledge management activities for capturing, storing, sharing, learning, exploring, and exploiting knowledge related to a particular task. Based on the proposed model, this paper also highlights three factors of implementing knowledge management strategies: people, policy, and technology. Each factor has a different impact on the success of KM strategies. This paper proposes that KM is more than just the advantage of technology, intranet and Internet, but includes organizational issues, assumes information resource management together with the cultural change which is important in the KM implementation process.

It defines the purpose of the honeypot, the basic component of a honeynet, as ""an information system resource whose value lies in unauthorized or illicit use of that resource"". The objective of a honeynet is to attract malicious attackers, study their offensive strategy, and track every movement they make. The honeynet becomes a useful tool as one analyzes the data gathered from it to build new security into their system. Including a honeynet project in a Brigham Young University IT security curriculum provides hands-on experience with the dynamic Internet and all of the security components that go into securing a network. A VMware environment was used to create a virtual honeynet (Virtual) and compare its effectiveness to a network of physical computers (Real). This allowed students to learn the strengths and weaknesses of both Real and Virtual systems, and better prepare them to work with both. The areas in which Virtual and Real were compared are setup, deployment, maintenance, data collection, and data analysis. Virtual required only one computer whereas Real required one for each honeynet function. Setup was the area of greatest difference as Virtual dealt with virtual components whereas Real involved physical components. The issue of not being able to disguise a virtual network to appear ""real"" is the major concern as a honeynet is only as effective as it appears to be a real, functioning network. Likewise, it is only as good as the data it collects. Maintenance of the networks is where Virtual gained the advantage over Real. One must constantly rebuild the honeypots as they get attacked and trashed. This returning to a base build is much more efficient in the Virtual realm. Gaining experience with a Virtual honeynet, also, was found to be most effective to train teams to more efficiently implement a Rea- l honeynet","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0406-1; POD:1-4244-0405-3","10.1109/ITHET.2006.339685","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141694","Attack Data Analysis;Honey Net;Honey Pot;Honey Wall;Maintenance;Security Curriculum;Virtualization","Computer networks;Computer security;Data analysis;Data security;Education;IP networks;Information systems;Internet;Physics computing;Tracking","computer aided instruction;computer science education;security of data;teaching","Honeynet Project;IT security curriculum;Internet community;VMware environment;attack data analysis;computer security;honey wall;honeypot;information system resource;malicious attackers;network security;teaching resource;virtual honey net","","5","","2","","","","10-13 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the applicability of hierarchical RL algorithms is limited by the fact that the task decomposition has to be performed in advance by the human designer. We propose a Lamarckian evolutionary approach for automatic development of the learning structure in hierarchical RL. The proposed method combines the MAXQ hierarchical RL method and genetic programming (GP). In the MAXQ framework, a subtask can optimize the policy independently of its parent task's policy, which makes it possible to reuse learned policies of the subtasks. In the proposed method, the MAXQ method learns the policy based on the task hierarchies obtained by GP, while the GP explores the appropriate hierarchies using the result of the MAXQ method. To show the validity of the proposed method, we have performed simulation experiments for a foraging task in three different environmental settings. The results show strong interconnection between the obtained learning structures and the given task environments. The main conclusion of the experiments is that the GP can find a minimal strategy, i.e., a hierarchy that minimizes the number of primitive subtasks that can be executed for each type of situation. The experimental results for the most challenging environment also show that the policies of the subtasks can continue to improve, even after the structure of the hierarchy has been evolutionary stabilized, as an effect of Lamarckian mechanisms","1089-778X;1089778X","","10.1109/TEVC.2006.890270","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141056","Autonomous development;Lamarckian evolution;genetic programming (GP);hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL)","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer science education;Computer vision;Genetic programming;Humans;Laboratories;Learning;Object recognition;Telecommunication computing","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence)","Lamarckian evolutionary development;MAXQ hierarchical RL method;foraging task;genetic programming;hierarchical learning structures;hierarchical reinforcement learning;task decomposition","","11","","21","","","","April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Computer aided training systems offer a flexible and cost-effective method for learning new skills. The satisfactory management of risk situations involves risk identification, the development of risk handling strategies and plans and the conduct and monitoring of those plans. Recognising the importance of tacit knowledge, scenario-based training has gained importance in recent years. For example, USA General Accounting Office (GAO) released a report on Homeland security titled Risk Management approach can guide preparedness efforts. This report provides a list of risk assessment measurements for contingency plan development and a matrix for risk-based scenario development. In this paper, integrating traditional scenario-based training with desktop VR systems using game engineering, we investigate how a virtual reality training system, which draws on research in the areas of computer games, knowledge acquisition, agent technology and natural language processing, can provide a safe learning experience to assist acquisition of the necessary tacit knowledge. The aim of RiskMan is to train police officers to handle high-risk situations. RiskMan is an ARC Discovery project carried out by the Department of Computing in Macquarie University. RiskMan has been developed using a very-high level scripting language of a game engine, Unreal Tournament 2004. It is composed of modules such as a Scenario-based Expert System, a Narrative Engine, a Game Engine, and a CAD package.

In this work we present case studies of moderately large biomedical engineering and biology courses. We discuss what types of questions and classroom strategies are effective in supporting HPL-inspired induction. A possibly unrecognized benefit of using a PRS system is its effect on instructors. We discuss the beneficial effects of PRS use on instructors and the changes in teaching strategies these systems brought about. The insight about the fragility of students' knowledge revealed by the PRS prompted the instructors to invest more time in designing formative assessment and in developing ways to address misconceptions. Use of the PRS also prompted the instructors to expand their instruction from merely content to include thought processes typical in their domain.

In POL, students choose their own workload and the team is responsible for behaving in such a way that the team goals are accomplished. This means that they must be efficient when assigning tasks among themselves. However, students have different maturity levels, so this [efficient] conduct does not occur per se. The dynamics of team interaction and other conflicts inherent in human behavior can place a term's project success at risk. Thus, emotions have been identified as important players in allowing for responsible, mature behavior to be portrayed.

Firstly, the layered model of the bidding decision support system for power supplier has been proposed. In this model, the system composes of four layers: data gathering layer, data processing layer, bidding analyzing layer and bidding decision-making layer. Additionally, in order to realize the human-computer interaction, the presentation layer has been added in the system. In the presentation layer, in order to integrate the useful web data to data warehouse, the method is proposed to transfer the HTML page into XML data source combined with Agent technology. So, the power supplier could make the best of network resource, and transfer them into own data warehouse for building the optimal bidding strategy. Then, the applications of Agent on the application layer and on the data layer are analyzed respectively. In the implementation of the functional Agent, it is the blackboard system that has been used to design communication mode, the Agent is constructed by the deliberative Agent structure, and by KQML language, the communication principle and communication language among the function modules has been realized. According to this method, the feasible and efficient bidding decision support system could be constituted for the power supplier. Finally an example of application has been given to illustrate that it is valuable for the power supplier to constitute the bidding decision-making support system based on multi-Agent for optimal bidding strategy.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0111-9; POD:1-4244-0110-0","10.1109/ICPST.2006.321805","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4115975","Bidding decision support system;Communication language;Functional layer;Multi-agent system (MAS);Power supplier;electricity market","Buildings;Data processing;Data warehouses;Decision making;Decision support systems;HTML;Multiagent systems;Power supplies;Power system modeling;XML","XML;decision support systems;multi-agent systems;power engineering computing;power markets","HTML page;KQML language;Web data;XML data source;bidding analyzing layer;bidding decision-making layer;bidding decision-making support system;blackboard system;communication language;communication principle;data gathering layer;data processing layer;data warehouse;deliberative agent structure;functional agent;human-computer interaction;multiagent system;power supplier","","1","","18","","","","22-26 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such translations are important because they afford learners and educators with the opportunity to a survey a wide selection of learning and teaching material. For instance, university instructors are sometimes required to assess curriculum from courses delivered from other programs or universities, even internationally. Often, the only learning object available to do so is the course outline made available in HTML format on a Web page. Generally there is an abundance of metadata available from such learning objects and this information can be used to generate useful components of the ontology. Other useful information can be derived from first establishing the domain of the object, electricity and computing for instance, or possibly history. Once extracted, the information representing learning objects can be stored as elements in an XML template. The purpose of this work was to develop and implement a machine learning strategy for classifying course outlines into pre-defined domains and sub-domains in order to provide this information to an ontology repository designed to aid in the translation of such objects. First some typical domains were identified. Then, 20-30 course outlines were chosen to represent each sub-domain. Next, frequency tables of words common to the course outlines for a given sub-domain were generated in order to compile an ordered list of synonyms used to represent the sub-domains. Finally, a new set of course outlines were randomly selected for classification based on an analysis of the synonym content of each.

Our illustrations target a general audience of laypersons interested in relativity. We discuss visualization strategies, motivated by physics education and the didactics of mathematics, and describe what kind of visualization methods have proven to be useful for different types of media, such as still images in popular science magazines, film contributions to TV shows, oral presentations, or interactive museum installations. Our primary approach is to adopt an egocentric point of view: the recipients of a visualization participate in a visually enriched thought experiment that allows them to experience or explore a relativistic scenario. In addition, we often combine egocentric visualizations with more abstract illustrations based on an outside view in order to provide several presentations of the same phenomenon. Although our visualization tools often build upon existing methods and implementations, the underlying techniques have been improved by several novel technical contributions like image-based special relativistic rendering on GPUs, special relativistic 4D ray tracing for accelerating scene objects, an extension of general relativistic ray tracing to manifolds described by multiple charts, GPU-based interactive visualization of gravitational light deflection, as well as planetary terrain rendering. The usefulness and effectiveness of our visualizations are demonstrated by reporting on experiences with, and feedback from, recipients of visualizations and collaborators.","1077-2626;10772626","","10.1109/TVCG.2006.69","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634317","Visualization;astrophysics;explanatory computer graphics;general relativity;illustrative visualization;special relativity;terrain rendering.;visualization of mathematics","Acceleration;Astrophysics;Feedback;Layout;Mathematics;Physics education;Ray tracing;Rendering (computer graphics);TV;Visualization","astronomy computing;cosmology;data visualisation;general relativity;rendering (computer graphics);special relativity","Einstein theory;GPU-based interactive visualization;astrophysics;cosmology;egocentric visualizations;general relativistic ray tracing;gravitational light deflection;image-based special relativistic rendering;mathematic didactics;physics education;planetary terrain rendering;scene objects;special relativistic 4D ray tracing","Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Computer-Assisted Instruction;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Theoretical;Physics;User-Computer Interface","13","","52","","","","July-Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

At the Rochester Institute of Technology, the undergraduate introductory software engineering course has been redesigned from a traditional lecture-lab format to a project-centric studio format. The student team focus has allowed us to better incorporate active learning by promoting collaboration among students and instructors in the development of a term long software project. In order to make the studio format more effective we have adopted a blended learning approach. Blended learning aims to join the best of face-to-face classroom learning with the best of online teaching and learning to promote active independent learning and reduce class seat time. Student satisfaction in courses requiring a collaborative effort among their peers is heavily influenced by their project team experience. The use of blended learning techniques helps to make the experience a more satisfying one by increasing the effectiveness of collaboration in team activities and interaction with the instructor through the application of distance learning and social computing technologies. The challenges faced and the techniques and strategies utilized in the planning and delivery of the course was discussed, including the utilization of online learning support infrastructure.

Though several recent researches provide workflow-based e-learning, format definition and analysis of learning process, organization of distributed learning objects still have not be fully considered. This paper first introduced the format definition method of workflow-based courses using fuzzy Petri nets, and then proposed a workflow based e-learning architecture by utilizing workflow technology and learning object services. This architecture provides teachers tool for designing courses as composition of learning object services, and gives students the opportunities to achieve an orderly learning experience through adaptive navigating e-learning services step by step under the control of certain learning strategy.

Intelligent prefetching strategy can recognize the current access pattern by analyzing the access trace independently. Prefetching based on the pattern recognized is more effective than blindly prefetching. Using this algorithm in a VI-based data grid prototype system (VI-DGPS), the storage nodes is divided into groups by the relation of the data, only one node judges the pattern and all other nodes just receive the pattern info in a group. All nodes in a group prefetch synchronously based on the access pattern to reduce the request response time.

Although our visualization tools build upon existing methods and implementations, these techniques have been improved by several novel technical contributions like image-based special relativistic rendering on GPUs, an extension of general relativistic ray tracing to manifolds described by multiple charts, GPU-based interactive visualization of gravitational light deflection, as well as planetary terrain rendering.

Taking advantage of the merit of multi-population, population size can be cut down appropriately by means of inter-population crossover. Because of the inter-population operator, the individuals' diversity will not turn worse due to the shrunken population size. The parallel strategy comprises a mapping of one (or a few) population(s) onto each processor of MIMD multiprocessing system.

System-level design languages (SLDLs) allow the representation of a system at multiple levels of abstraction. Two leading SLDLs, SpecC and SystemC, are taught in Iowa State University's graduate-level embedded systems course, CPRE 588. SpecC includes a handful of explicit language constructs that directly address characteristics of embedded applications, which gives students a quick start into understanding the concepts of system-level design. Moreover, a clear refinement methodology is defined for SpecC. However, SystemC has widespread industry support in many commercial tools, which gives students experience with actual practices.

This system was used to investigate how different methods of performance error feedback can lead to faster and more complete motor learning in individuals asked to compensate for a novel visuo-motor transformation (a 30 degree rotation). Four groups of normal human subjects were asked to reach with their unseen arm to visual targets surrounding a central starting location. A cursor tracking hand motion was provided during each reach. For one group of subjects, deviations from the ""ideal"" compensatory hand movement (i.e. trajectory errors) were amplified with a gain of 2 whereas another group was provided visual feedback with a gain of 3.1. Yet another group was provided cursor feedback wherein the cursor was rotated by an additional (constant) offset angle. We compared the rates at which the hand paths converged to the steady-state trajectories. Our results demonstrate that error-augmentation can improve the rate and extent of motor learning of visuomotor rotations in healthy subjects. We also tested this method on straightening the movements of stroke subjects, and our early results suggest that error amplification can facilitate neurorehabilitation strategies in brain injuries such as stroke.","1945-7898;19457898","POD:0-7803-9003-2","10.1109/ICORR.2005.1501152","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1501152","","Brain injuries;Control systems;Education;Humans;Real time systems;Rehabilitation robotics;Robot sensing systems;Steady-state;Target tracking;Testing","adaptive control;adaptive systems;computer vision;control engineering computing;error compensation;medical robotics;patient rehabilitation","2 degree-of-freedom robotic system;brain injuries;error amplification;error-augmentation;motor learning enhancement;neurorehabilitation strategies;performance error feedback;rehabilitative relearning;stroke;trajectory errors;visual error augmentation;visuo-motor transformation;visuomotor rotations;xPC Target","","17","","22","","","","28 June-1 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By the help of PSAs, the resource management system can analyze what's the impact of a service for the user, and determines how to schedule the underlying resources.

It is a discipline whose importance is growing more and more apparent. It is also one of ten essential areas recommended by computing curriculum software engineering (CCSE) 2003. In spite of its importance, there are almost no dedicated courses at the undergraduate level covering this important discipline, although there is definite interest [J. Tomakyo et al., (2004)]. At Southern Polytechnic State University, as part of our BS in software engineering, we have started offering a course on software architecture and design, which focuses on designing software, at the highest level (software architecture) and the detailed level. In this paper we detail the contents and the pedagogical approach of that course. We describe the structure of this course, its knowledge units, which include design principles, design strategies, architectural design and attributes, detailed design, component-oriented design, and design support tools and evaluation. We also describe the topics in each knowledge unit (for example, design patterns is a topic in detailed design). The strategies for choosing design styles and patterns based on the trade-off of system attributes and combinations of various architectural styles and design patterns are also emphasized.

Normally, the mapping between authors and reviewers is simplified to a blinded, random association. The proposed adaptive strategy suggests an effective method for assigning reviewers and authors depending on user profiles and based on fuzzy classification techniques.

"On computation of state avoidance control for infinite state systems in assignment program framework","R. Kumar; V. K. Garg","Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","20050117","2005","2","1","87","91","We study supervisory control of discrete event systems with potentially infinite state-space using state variables for representation and specification. An assignment program model consisting of state variables and a finite set of conditional assignment statements is used for representing a discrete event system, and a predicate over state variables is used for representing a state avoidance control specification. The contribution of this paper is to show how to perform supervisory control computations symbolically. In the case of a Petri net (vector addition system) with the set of forbidden states being a right-closed set, we present a finitely terminating algorithm for maximally permissive supervision. Discrete-event systems are systems with discrete states that evolve in response to discrete events. The state space of such systems can be finite or infinite. The latter case occurs when the state-variables can take infinitely many values such as integers. Certain states in a given system may be ""bad"", such as a deadlocking state. Then, controllers must be designed to restrict the system behavior by dynamically disabling events occurring in the system so that system never reaches the bad states. Also, certain events can be uncontrollable and cannot be disabled. State-avoidance control of potentially infinite-state discrete-event systems is studied in this paper. A compact program-like modeling formalism has been adopted. Although the control problem for infinite-state systems is in general not solvable in an automated fashion owing to its undecidability established We develop a symbolic technique, that is iterative in nature and can be automated, for computing a control strategy. If the iteration terminates (there is no guarantee though), a controller is computed. We illustrate through several examples where the iterative computation does terminate. Finally, we show that for a certain class of infinite-state systems that can be modeled as Petri nets, the iterative computation is guaranteed to terminate whenever the state-avoidance set is lower-bounded (every state that ""dominates"" a bad state is itself bad).","1545-5955;15455955","","10.1109/TASE.2004.829432","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1381372","","Automatic control;Control engineering education;Control system synthesis;Control systems;Discrete event systems;Iterative algorithms;Petri nets;State-space methods;Supervisory control;System recovery","Petri nets;discrete event systems;multidimensional systems;reachability analysis;state-space methods","Petri nets;assignment program model;discrete event systems;finitely terminating algorithm;infinite state space systems;maximally permissive supervision;reachability analysis;state avoidance control;supervisory control computations;symbolic technique","","14","","18","","","","Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For example, 3D graphical scenes are common in video games, advertisements, and movies. However, the uses of the characters in these environments have been explored in only a limited way. We would like to significantly increase the utility of animated characters in such environments with respect to effective education and training. In this project, we aim to advance the state of the art in end-user programming by supporting the development of 3D animated content by end users for the purpose of training other users. In particular, we are interested in strategy-oriented programming in virtual worlds, in which synthetic characters are programmed to select and execute appropriate strategies. The purpose is to support domain experts in creating the characters' content for virtual training environments, such as for emergency personnel training or educational simulations, without requiring the content creators to have prior knowledge of computer science or animation. We propose to support end users in programming these synthetic characters as directly as possible, by sketching and demonstrating desirable behaviors with characters from their own problem domains. For example, a football coach might create animated synthetic players and implicitly train them to have complex strategies and behaviors. These synthetic agents will be used to train humans in complex strategies and behaviors by having them play against and with each other. Similar virtual environments can be used to train firefighters, military personnel, emergency workers, and children learning problem-solving skills via educational simulations","","POD:0-7803-8696-5","10.1109/VLHCC.2004.24","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1372342","","Animation;Computational modeling;Computer science;Computer simulation;Educational programs;Games;Layout;Motion pictures;Personnel;Programming profession","avatars;computer animation;computer based training;software agents","3D animated content;3D graphical scenes;3D interactive environments;3D virtual agents;computer animation;computer science;educational simulations;emergency personnel training;end-user programming;strategy-oriented programming;synthetic characters;virtual environments;virtual training environments;virtual worlds","","0","","3","","","","30-30 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In client-server applications, this adaptability is very important to enhance the reliability of the system and maintain the consistency of the objects. We describe a framework that can detect the changes in performance of the execution environment, and provide strategies in order to adapt such changes. Using these access strategies the client objects can access the server objects efficiently in a dynamically changing environment. We do not only consider the dynamic changes of the network characteristics but also consider the end-hosts performances before changing to the optimal strategy. Therefore the client objects can achieve the maximum usefulness of the environment. Here, we introduce three access strategies, namely client migration, direct access, and lazy access to impart an adaptive behavior to the client objects in the distributed environment. Advancing from the conventional static access models we propose algorithms to select the best-suited access strategy for the dynamic environment. Moreover the proposed model is to be implemented to the ""juice"" distributed object-oriented environment.","","POD:0-7695-2051-0","10.1109/AINA.2004.1283834","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1283834","","Artificial intelligence;Bandwidth;Biomedical informatics;Computer networks;Distributed computing;Educational technology;IP networks;Maintenance;Network servers;Object oriented modeling","client-server systems;object-oriented methods;open systems","adaptable access strategy;client migration;client-server application;direct access;distributed object-oriented environment;end-host performance;lazy access;network characteristics;open distributed environment;static access model","","1","","9","","","","29-31 March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multidisciplinary expeditions to little-known or unknown ocean regions of the world ocean lie at the heart of accomplishing this mission and have taken scientists and educators to the Galapagos Rift, the Arctic Ocean, the Gulf of Alaska seamounts, and other areas as they sought to more completely know and understand our ocean. This presentation will focus on how NOAA is forming collaborations among scientists and educators to develop education and outreach resources tied to these expeditions, professional development for teachers to learn how to use these resources, and web-based daily logs from sea to supplement expedition-based lesson plans. This education program is directed at unfolding Key Objective 4 of the President's Panel on Ocean Exploration Report entitled Discovering Earth's Final Frontier: A U.S. Strategy for Ocean Exploration. This objective specifically calls for ""reaching out in new ways to stakeholders to improve the literacy of learners with respect to ocean issues."" A summary of the National Ocean Exploration Education Workshop findings will be presented, along with future programmatic priorities based on the workshop findings.","","POD:0-933957-30-0","10.1109/OCEANS.2003.178100","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282615","","Arctic;Chemicals;Collaboration;Educational programs;Heart;Oceans","geophysics computing;learning systems;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;physics education;teaching","Arctic Ocean;Discovering Earth Final Frontier;Galapagos Rift;Gulf of Alaska seamounts;NOAA;National Ocean Exploration Education Workshop;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration;Ocean Exploration Report;Office of Ocean Exploration;President Panel;US Strategy;education program;expedition-based lesson plan;exploration education;learner literacy;ocean issue;professional development;stakeholder;teacher;unfolding Key Objective;web-based daily log","","0","","","","","","22-26 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, we set out to create our own framework that would fulfill all requirements, satisfy the aims of the course, the computing skills level of the intended group of students, and the size of the intended group of students. Besides the designed agent framework, which embodies the concepts of concurrency, multiagent systems, and persistency, the strategy for the best possible utilization of the developed tool for the goals of guiding and instructing the students in their learning of AI concepts and techniques, is also discussed. The results of the coursework suggest that the developed agent framework is highly suitable for the purposes of teaching students the AI basics including the knowledge representation schemes, rule-based reasoning and intelligent agents paradigm.","","POD:0-7803-7724-9","10.1109/ITRE.2003.1270651","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1270651","","Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Concurrent computing;Education;Intelligent agent;Java;Knowledge engineering;Knowledge representation;Multiagent systems;Programming profession","Java;computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;knowledge engineering;multi-agent systems;teaching","AI programming;Java-implemented agent framework;educational tool;intelligent agent paradigm;knowledge engineering;knowledge representation scheme;multiagent system;rule-based reasoning;rule-based system;semantic network;undergraduate computer science students;undergraduate course","","2","17","11","","","","11-13 Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The study curricula of the Faculty's specializations (Applied Electronics and Communications) include long-term courses focused on the next domains: basis of electronics, electronic circuits and devices, signals and systems, programming and technological design. Packaging related aspects are mainly covered by the technological design and electronic circuit's courses. The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence of such Electronic Packaging information in our curricula during the past ten years. The curricula restructuring process relies on the continuous adaptation and updating of the delivered teaching activities in order to compensate the main drawbacks of the last years: the student's change of professional interest from hardware design to software design and the technological gap between our current equipment endowment and the current level of technology worldwide required. Thus, the process of upgrading the equipment involved promoting actions for the IT features and benefits in design and teaching processes. The paper presents the main strategy to include IT features in Electronic Packaging teaching process. The strategy covers a large domain: from modern CAD tools to Internet access to relevant and useful information and even by creating new virtual platforms for Electronic Packaging lab sessions (e.g. using Matlab). The study also covers the impact of the described actions: the new openings in developing professional relations with Electronics Packaging relating enterprises or Research centres, the increased professional value of our graduates providing those better ways to fit the industry needs.","","POD:0-7803-8002-9","10.1109/ISSE.2003.1260532","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260532","","Design automation;Education;Electronic circuits;Electronics packaging;Hardware;Information analysis;Process design;Programming profession;Signal design;Software design","CAD;computer aided instruction;educational courses;electronic engineering computing;electronic engineering education;electronics packaging","CAD tools;Electronic Packaging education;IT benefits;Internet access;Romania;Technical University of Cluj-Napoca;curricula restructuring;equipment upgrading;hardware design;professional relations;software design;teaching process;technological design;virtual platforms","","1","","5","","","","8-11 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ESIL is both a physical space and a teaching philosophy. It occupies two laboratory spaces at the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department, and it is also an environment where students are active participants in the learning process. Undergraduate research projects at ESIL provide an opportunity for students to study in detail theoretical concepts presented in class, improve their understanding of engineering principles and applications, and explore the frontiers of knowledge in power engineering. The ESIL also fosters the integration of teaching and research and the development of new teaching methods for the improvement of undergraduate education. This is done by adapting the results from projects to courses in the form of demonstrations and laboratory practices.

This novel concept mimics recent neurobiological insights on human control of eye movements (TD algorithm). TD algorithms are predictive reinforcement algorithms for learning of action sequences. In the proposed framework, standard techniques, such as template matching, are used as processing steps. Each processing step compares a template of one part of the object with image locations and computes a value that describes how well the template matches. A TD algorithm is trained on many images to optimize the sequence of processing steps by providing feedback whether the final object recognition was correct or incorrect. After training, the algorithm searches for template matches with the sequence of templates and locations that are most promising for recognition of a certain object. This object recognition strategy resembles active information gathering by saccadic eye movements.","","POD:0-7803-7958-6","10.1109/KIMAS.2003.1245074","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1245074","","Computer science;Education;Face recognition;Humans;Image recognition;Neurons;Object recognition;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Process planning","active vision;image matching;image motion analysis;image recognition;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets","TD algorithm;image locations;image recognition;image sequences;information gathering;neurobiological concept;reinforcement algorithms;saccadic eye movements;template matching","","0","","36","","","","30 Sept.-4 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings.","20030320","2002","","","1007","1010 vol.2","Online discussions can enhance Internet-based as well as traditional format classes. Course topics can be expanded and explored and students can express their opinions and debate controversial issues. When online discussions are not skillfully facilitated, however, they can become confusing and chaotic, with some people dominating the interactions and others hesitant to participate. In traditional classrooms, efforts are made to encourage a distribution of participation, to acknowledge contributions without being judgmental, and to avoid people interrupting other people. This can be done by calling on students with raised hands and encouraging non-contributors to participate. In online discussions contributions are made asynchronously so taking turns is built into the system. Skillful facilitation can increase participation, focus the dialogue if it has drifted from the topic, and promote and support thoughtful, meaningful responses. Writing effective group and individual interventions can be the key to successful facilitation. If you are faced with the challenge of facilitating online interactions and fostering online collaboration, there are tested strategies that can be learned, then modified for individual use. The following observations and suggestions are the result of five years of teaching in and observing an Internet-based, online Master's degree program.

On the long term, the project also aims at developing a strong regional competency kernel through the use of technology as a tool to encourage the development, documentation and use of indigenous information and knowledge about tropical islands environment: evaluate what is available, how it can be preserved, strengthened, amplified or improved through the introduction of ICT and how it could participate, in the basket of globalisation, as our share for a common identity. The authors show how enhancement and dissemination of research results can be achieved by a combination of an upstream strategy based on IKBS, a generic software for building knowledge bases on the Internet in natural sciences, and a downstream one, based on a pedagogical approach borrowed from the DARWIN world.

The architecture of the environment allows the integration of hypertext with simulators of DCS, PLC, and process operation. The simulators are specially designed to serve an application-oriented teaching approach, which involves the student in the simulation setup and the running of the application. They are able to simulate not only the execution of the software that realizes the regulatory control algorithms but also the start-up and emergency control strategies of an industrial process, the manual, automatic, and cascade modes of controller operation, and the man-machine interface of a DCS- or PLC-based control system.

Teachers from primary and junior high schools were mediated by groupware technology and learned to design lesson plans collaboratively. Various data sources such as system logs, group memories, interviews, and questionnaires were also collected. Through these three phases, we identify several types of processes of team-based knowledge sharing and creation in the professional cyber community, defined by the causal conditions, action/interaction strategies, and consequences.

The programme is delivered in on-campus, distance learning and offshore modes. It has a strongly espoused student-centred philosophy and is fully documented for distance learning. This provided a foundation for the implementation of online learning at programme level. A transitional strategy has been developed to make online learning a mainstream delivery mechanism. This paper provides a background to the problem based learning philosophy underpinning the program, and describes delivery and assessment methods used since the programme began in 1991. It then reflects on a range of development and management issues, relating to moving online, including: performance criteria for platform choice, resourcing, training and support, staff acceptance and usage, and student acceptance and usage. Evaluation of the situation during the transition has been informed by feedback collected from academic staff and students.","","","10.1049/ic:20020100","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1028461","","","building;computer aided instruction;distance learning;educational courses;management education","Australia;Bachelor of Construction Management (Building) programme;University of Newcastle;building technology;communication;computing;construction economics;curriculum study areas;distance learning;ethics;integrated problem-based learning approach;management;management issues;on-campus delivery;online learning;performance criteria;principles;quantity surveying;resourcing;staff acceptance;student acceptance;student-centred philosophy;training","","0","","","","","","3-4 Jan. 2002","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

They affect the organisations involved in creating, maintaining and using them and they can have a profound effect on the people involved, directly or indirectly. The causes of systems and project failures, vary considerably. Each case has to be taken in isolation and examined, to see where it has gone wrong in the past, or is starting to go wrong at present. In a true-life scenario, it is essential to be able to predict likely problems that may arise or accurately recognise failure symptoms when they occur. To achieve this it is important to be able to identify what is really going on and when these facts have been established, to be able to select a suitable means of handling the situation. Two European Esprit research projects examined software and multimedia quality practices and provided a framework for addressing these issues. These frameworks did not just promote best practices within software engineering, but sought to address some of the wider issues of systems and their role within the business.

The paper presents the use of symbolic computation in electromagnetics, where the complexity of the involved mathematics often prevents the students from understanding the underlying physical aspects. The educational strategy the authors propose is complementary to the numerical approach. It is based on actual symbolic calculation of electromagnetic field, not just on field visualization. An example of a Maple V worksheet dedicated to the computation of magnetic field with the Biot-Savart-Laplace method (BSL) is presented. The worksheet contains a theoretical introduction, 8 solved problems (equations, text and plots) and 12 proposed projects. After going through several solved problems, the students are asked to make changes in the worksheet and to discuss the results. They are finally required to conceive their own worksheets for solving new proposed problems, using the BSL worksheet as a model. Their experience shows that the symbolic computation has an outstanding educational potential not only in mathematics, circuits and systems, but also in electromagnetics","0018-9359;00189359","","10.1109/13.925873","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=925873","","Circuits;Computer aided instruction;Distributed computing;Electrical engineering education;Electromagnetic fields;Magnetic analysis;Magnetic fields;Mathematics;Physics computing;Signal analysis","computer aided instruction;electrical engineering computing;electrical engineering education;electromagnetic fields;symbol manipulation","CAI;Maple V worksheet;educational potential;educational tool;electrical engineering education;electromagnetic field;students;symbolic computation;undergraduate electromagnetics education","","2","","","","","","May 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

By constructing the environment in this fashion, the math engine can be replaced with a different one or with a real plant, or can even be ported to a remote server. A Web-based, multiuser virtual lab is also possible without the necessity of reprogramming the experimentation interface code.

The goal of SSM is to simulate a lecture situation for students working in a remote learning environment. Early attempts at developing remote learning focused on distributing class notes electronically. Today students can benefit from hearing a lecture as well as seeing materials being presented. Using SSM, students are able to control the rate of the presentation, to explore supplementary material; they can call up ancillary problem solving tools, and use the rich environment of a computing system as they view a lecture. This rich learning environment has been shown to improve the overall understanding and comprehension obtained by students in a variety of technical courses.

The idea is that as the student learns a particular computer skill, they can immediately apply it to solve problems assigned in other parts of the integrated engage program. Second, the manner in which the skills are assessed ensure mastery. The student must pass a set of ""proficiency exams"" that cover all aspects of the computer skills. These exams measure the minimum skills that are deemed necessary for success and a student must pass all proficiency exams by the end of the semester in order to pass the course.

Negative consequences for the talent pool available for the future workforce and equal opportunity. Mentoring has been lauded as a strategy to improve retention of women students in engineering and related fields. Electronic communications now can support a cost-effective opportunity for mentoring which transcends previous constraints to extensive mentoring programs-time, synchronous communication, and geography. In early 1998, WEPAN, the Women in Engineering Programs and Advocates Network, launched ""MentorNet"", a national electronic industrial mentoring program. MentorNet pairs undergraduate and graduate women studying engineering and related sciences with volunteers in industry in a year-long structured mentoring relationship conducted via e-mail. MentorNet offers online applications, matching, training, and ongoing coaching for participants, and evaluation. In its pilot semester in early 1998, MentorNet paired 204 student from 15 universities with mentors in industry. In 1998-99, 539 students from 26 universities were matched with mentors.

Some of the reasons for this interest are that: (1) students have more options as to when and how they will learn; (2) distance education is far more practical; (3) staff teaching time can be reduced substantially in the long term; and (4) the computer animation achievable through currently available multimedia tools can enable more effective learning of difficult concepts; etc. Despite the potential benefits, the percentage of academic staff actively pursuing development of flexible delivery units in their courses is small. The reason for this reluctance is the seemingly daunting amount of effort required to produce the necessary multimedia tools. The time required to become proficient in multimedia packages is in itself a major deterrent. This paper describes one methodology for surprisingly efficient development of flexible delivery materials. The key to the methodology is to perform the development in a sequence of stages. The stages are designed so that useful products are available at the completion of all stages, even the first one. The approach has been trialed at RMIT with very encouraging success-class contact time has been substantially reduced and students are happy about the changes","","POD:1-86435-451-8","10.1109/ISSPA.1999.815729","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=815729","","Animation;Australia;Automatic testing;Distance learning;Education;Multimedia systems;Packaging;Signal processing;Software tools;Videos","computer aided instruction;computer animation;educational courses;electronic engineering education;multimedia computing;teaching","computer animation;courses;distance education;flexible learning material development strategy;multimedia packages;multimedia tools;staff teaching time;students","","0","","9","","","","1999","22 Aug 1999-25 Aug 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Easy equation sets have one unknown variable in each equation such that the equations can be solved sequentially. Hard equation sets have one critical unknown located in many (or all) of the equations in the set such that many (or all) of the equations must be solved simultaneously. We call these equations ""coupled"" and we teach students how they can analyze equation sets (based on the location of known and unknown variables) to ""decouple"" the equations and make the solution path easy. We describe the algorithm called the DeCoupler, which is used to identify variable interactions to determine the optimal decoupling variables. We also describe the SmartSwapper algorithm, which uses information from the DeCoupler to simplify the solution path and parametrically iterate to a solution. The algorithms are logic based rather than numerically focused. The algorithms have been implemented into an equation solving software program (SmartSolve2) to demonstrate their effectiveness compared to other commercial strategies. It has been shown that these algorithms can solve nonlinear simultaneous equations without the need for highly refined initial guesses. By teaching the concepts of these algorithms, students are assisted in becoming more effective problem solvers.","0190-5848;01905848","POD:0-7803-5643-8","10.1109/FIE.1999.839271","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839271","","Algorithm design and analysis;Convergence of numerical methods;Logic;Nonlinear equations;Optimized production technology;Systems engineering and theory","computer aided instruction;mathematics computing;nonlinear equations","DeCoupler algorithm;SmartSolve2;SmartSwapper algorithm;coupled equations;easy equation sets;equation solving software program;hard equation sets;nonlinear equation systems solution;nonlinear simultaneous equations;optimal decoupling variables;problem solvers;simulation","","0","","7","","","","10-13 Nov. 1999","10 Nov 1999-13 Nov 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent critiques of engineering education, state the need a slightly different way. They claim that engineering education has focused too much of its energy on engineering science at the expense of engineering design. The author considers how Georgia Tech's EduTech Institute is spearheading an interdisciplinary effort to address these needs. Key to the effort is a two-quarter pre-disciplinary introduction to design.

Remote Sensing - A Scientific Vision for Sustainable Development., 1997 IEEE International","20020806","1997","2","","854","856 vol.2","Earth system science (ESS) is a holistic study of the Earth. ESS marshals the resources a variety of scientific and technical fields to explore interactions among the Earth's component subsystems in order to understand the Earth as a system, to explain Earth dynamics and Earth evolution, and to address the problem of the affects of human actions on global change. In order to investigate the Earth system, teachers and students need access to expertise in a broad variety of disciplines: chemistry, physics, computer science, biology, mathematics, statistics, and political science. A variety of relatively new skills are also required: networked computing, tools and techniques for retrieving, visualizing, and analyzing remote sensing data, and building dynamic systems models. The question of visualization of remote sensing data became a central issue in curriculum development efforts of the Earth System Science Community (ESSC), a three-year project supported by NASA's Information Infrastructure Technology and Applications and High Performance Computing and Communication programs. The thrust of the curriculum development effort was to enable students and teachers to conduct investigations in global change topics using remote sensing data gathered by NASA and other science agencies. The curriculum was project-based, with the intention of producing an authentic and living sense of understanding and participation in science research. Students and teachers were to collaborate online with their peers in other schools, and with scientists/mentors in universities and government science agencies. In this effort students and teachers become researchers and learn to design and carry out a research strategy, involving the proposal and articulation of a hypothesis, the building of a system model, and the search, retrieval, manipulation, visualization and analysis of appropriate data. Students conclude their research by testing their hypothesis with available data, using visualization software, and information available in print and on-line. Finally, students communicate the results of their research by publishing their reports, data, data products, and systems models","","POD:0-7803-3836-7","10.1109/IGARSS.1997.615278","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=615278","","Curriculum development;Data analysis;Data visualization;Earth;Educational institutions;Electronic switching systems;Evolution (biology);Geoscience;Information retrieval;Remote sensing","Earth;Internet;education;educational aids;geology;geophysical techniques;remote sensing;teaching","Earth System Science classroom;Earth science;Internet;NASA;WWW;World Wide Web;data visualization;education;educational aid;geophysical technique;geoscience;remote sensing;teaching","","0","","13","","","","3-8 Aug 1997","03 Aug 1997-08 Aug 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To summarise the task of e-commerce security, its primary purpose is not to protect the messages exchanged during business transactions, but to protect the parties involved in those transactions. To be precise, security measures are there to limit the negative impact of engaging in commercial transactions over some electronic medium. Many commercial transactions have impact outside the e-world, and thus e-commerce security also needs to extend its basis beyond technical measures. The author concludes with a comment that has been well used by security professionals in the past: 'security is a people problem'. Education about information security in general and about e-commerce in particular for all parties involved has to be a core part of any strategy to improve e-commerce security.","0956-3385;09563385","","10.1049/cce:20000304","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=850785","","","electronic commerce","Internet services;commercial transactions;e-commerce security;e-world;education;electronic medium;information security;people problem;security measures;security professionals","","4","","","","","","June 2000","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

First and second year courses such as calculus, physics, chemistry, electricity mechanics, etc., which have traditionally been assumed as essential for freshman and sophomore engineering students, are under serious scrutiny for possible modification or elimination. Perhaps the most dominant reason for this change in educational philosophy stems from the realization that many of the current “MTV Internet Surfing, raised-on-TV” generation appear to be insufficiently motivated by, or prepared for what has worked in the past. These tried-and-true static presentations of mathematical and technical material may offer too little direct interaction to the student accustomed to getting their information (and stimulation) from the high-tech communication media. These traditional presentations may simply be in need of updating and reconfiguring. There also appears to be significant fragmentation, either real or perceived by students, between these required math/science/engineering fundamental courses and subsequent advanced engineering courses.

The remediation of developmental dyslexia is, at best, difficult for the dyslexic concerned. The normal diagnostic route is not readily (or easily) available to secondary schools and is almost certainly not within the scope of secondary school budgets. Furthermore, dyslexia is not widely tested for or even recognized by some education authorities. Microcomputers are no longer uncommon in schools and are still an underused resource. We propose an easy to use microcomputer based early screening system that will supplement existing testing strategies. The system that we propose has a secondary purpose. The tests will also provide us with data to help with ongoing research into the remediation and further understanding of dyslexia. We propose that enough data will allow us to develop software that will “learn” the grammatical mistakes made by a given dyslexic. We call this the “dyslexic on a disk” approach. The data provided by such software will not only allow the early diagnosis of a widely unrecognized, misunderstood and debilitating disorder but will also support research into the nature of the condition itself. We conclude by illustrating how such software can be built and employed. We propose several techniques for the analysis and possible real time microcomputer based remediation of the problem in hand","","","10.1049/ic:19970641","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=641225","","","medical diagnostic computing","budgets;cost;developmental dyslexia diagnosis;dyslexia remediation;education;grammatical mistakes;microcomputers;real time system;research;screening system;secondary schools;testing;time-consuming","","0","1","","","","","7 Mar 1997","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

The authors have identified two different interpretations of the term `learning styles'. The first interpretation sees personality and life experience as the key influences on learning styles, while the second defines learning styles as the practices students develop in response to the expectations of their teachers.

The student must then be free to try to solve the proposed problem using a strategy he thinks is the best one. The traditional way is using an expert system that solves the same problem and then compares both approaches. This behaviour is good enough to transfer the specialist knowledge for a beginner student, but it brings a restriction when learning a new subject. In medicine the diagnosis process is a graph search-like problem, where the physician determines a feasible way through all possible actions he can take at each moment (symptoms, historical data, etc.). He creates a path that he believes is the best way to achieve the desired goal, i.e., being able to explicit the cause of the troubles the patient presents. When a student is to learn how to work with the same situation, the system must give the student the knowledge used to find such a path. But the result of this process is better when instead of only saying to him what is to be done at each moment, the student is allowed to try his own ideas and giving him advice about each step through the path. A study and a specification of an ICAI to emergency medical service (“EMS”), that aims to help medical students when taking care of patients to be used in a University Hospital was developed.

Such skill models, however, can be used not only for transferring human control strategy to robots, but also for helping less-skilled human operators improve their performance. The authors propose a two-step approach for transferring skill from human expert to human apprentice. An expert's relevant control strategies or skills are first abstracted into a sensory-based computational model. Afterwards, this trained computational model is used to generate on-line advice for less-skilled operators who need to improve their skill. This advice can take advantage of many different sensor modalities, thereby potentially improving both the quality and speed of learning for the apprentice. Furthermore, this approach allows for the efficient transfer of skill from a single expert to many apprentices, as well as from many experts to a single apprentice. In this paper, the authors first describe a flexible neural-network-based method for modeling human control strategy and provide motivation for its use.

This relates to a general concern that education in the United States is not sufficiently process-oriented, and that graduates are not prepared to solve problems in a workplace. The authors present several multimedia tutorials designed by the CAEME Center at the University of Utah which use applications and interactive experimental procedures for teaching engineering courses. The multimedia modules provide students with opportunities to conduct virtual laboratories and make observations that often lead to the derivation of mathematical equations.

Coop distance learning during the work period provides an opportunity for enhancing students' cognitive, affective and behavioral development through continuous reflective dialogue and through facilitation of dialogue that connects the students' experiences to their academic curriculum. This paper presents interim results of a pilot program instituted for the 45 Northeastern University electrical and computer engineering (ECE) freshmen and sophomores who started their first coop work experience in 1996. Utilizing the Internet as a vehicle, students have been accessing structured learning assignments at regular intervals throughout their work period. Students access assignments on the ECE coop Web page and respond asynchronously via e-mail or the Web page to their instructors, or they interact with their classmates an common issues through the university's MeetingWeb<sup>TM</sup> computer conferencing system. Students thus have access to a virtual reflection seminar throughout the work period rather than waiting until the work period ends. Specific cognitive, affective and behavioral learning objectives have been identified and curriculum modules that allow students to meet these objectives have been developed.

ESS marshals the resources a variety of scientific and technical fields to explore interactions among the Earth's component subsystems in order to understand the Earth as a system, to explain Earth dynamics and evolution, and to address the problem of the effects of human actions on global change. In order to investigate the Earth system, teachers and students need access to expertise in a broad variety of disciplines: chemistry, physics, computer science, biology, mathematics, statistics, and political science. A variety of relatively new skills are also required: networked computing, tools and techniques for retrieving, visualizing, and analyzing remote sensing data, and building dynamic systems models. The question of systems modeling became a central issue in curriculum development efforts of the Earth System Science Community (ESSC), a three-year project supported by NASA's Information Infrastructure Technology and Applications and High Performance Computing and Communications programs. The thrust of the curriculum development effort was to enable students and teachers to conduct investigations in global change topics using remote sensing data gathered by NASA and other science agencies. The curriculum was project-based, with the intention of producing an authentic and living sense of understanding and participation in science research. Students and teachers were to collaborate on-line with their peers in other schools, and with scientists/mentors in universities and government science agencies. In this effort students and teachers become researchers and learn to design and carry out a research strategy, involving the proposal and articulation of a hypothesis, the building of a system model, and the search, retrieval, manipulation, visualization and analysis of appropriate data.

The advantages of using these tools over hand calculations include reduction in mathematical errors, faster execution of repetitive calculations, and exploration of alternative configurations. However, having students create these worksheets by hand increases the chance for errors in setting up the calculations and can increase the difficulty in understanding the concepts themselves. STructural Analysis Resource (STAR) is intended to allow students to concentrate on the concepts of structural analysis rather than the calculations, and to simplify the process of creating worksheets for solving problems. The key element of STAR is a graph representation of high-level abstractions of structural analysis methods and data. A student creates a problem-solving strategy by interactively building up a graph. The graph representation facilitates understanding of the relationship between concepts and the flow of data through a problem. The method nodes are hierarchically constructed by the instructor or student from system-supplied commands and/or other methods. Conversely, the method nodes are modeled as hierarchical “glass boxes”, which allow the student to expand a node and see the underlying intermediate steps; these steps are not and cannot be hidden from the student.

The analysis of problem-solving behaviors in these courses can provide an important source of information not only about how students approach problems in general, but how their performance might be enhanced through the development and assessment of instructional innovations. We have focused on the electromagnetics portion of our introductory physics sequence. This course has a failure rate exceeding 30%. Thus, any system for enhancing problem solving in this difficult course will significantly impact many students. A principal barrier to successful problem solving is lack of generalization, i.e. the ability to transfer knowledge and skills from one problem to another and to recognize classes of problems. The common tendency is to treat each problem as a separate entity to be approached by rigid application of memorized formulae, or simply by trial and error. Seemingly small changes in requirements or conditions can be met with bafflement. We have approached problem solving in two interlocked ways. One is the systematic analysis and classification of errors that students make when attempting standard problems in quizzes and exams.

Developments in configurable computing increasingly blur the line between hardware and software, a trend that represents a major shift in computing practice. To keep their offerings current and relevant, universities should modify their computer science curricula to better prepare students for this new era. Although hardware design is much more software-oriented now, aspiring computing students still need courses that cover hardware synthesis techniques, codesign methodologies, and module reuse strategies. Students should also experience working in teams. At our institute, we have developed such a new curriculum. By offering several hardware courses at both the elementary and advanced levels, we help students obtain a deeper and broader knowledge of configurable hardware design. Moreover, over the past few years we have invested in the design and construction of several FPGA-based boards for use as teaching platforms. These boards let students gain hands-on experience with technologies they'll use in real-world jobs.

In terms of gauging student understanding in physics, some critical questions are raised: (1) what factors serve to motivate students to participate in on-line discussions outside of class? (2) Can student motivation and performance be linked to students' individual learning styles? and (3) can student participation in on-line discussions be linked to enhanced understanding?

Such transformations are built upon community-sanctioned practices often referred to as ""back of the envelope"" calculations. First a problem statement (text) is translated into a sketch (diagram) which visually articulates the essential problem parts. Mechanical models and free-body diagrams are instances of this first transformation. The qualitative model is then transformed into a set of mathematical formulae (symbols), which drive the problem solution. Thus, the problem is solved using three types of representational systems: textual, diagrammatic and symbolic. At each step the engineer translates information from one representational system to another, enacting an abstract cultural algorithm. The knowledge necessary to undertake these transformations is described in this paper in the context of multi-literacies.

Individual characteristics related to prior experience, social context, ethnic/racial identity, and gender identity may each play a part in how the design of a learning experience influences student engagement, attitudes, interests, skills, and knowledge. To examine these relationships, this talk will present findings and implications of research conducted in conjunction with the design and development of The Science Behind Pixar, a large traveling exhibition created collaboratively by the Museum of Science, Boston and Pixar Animation Studios. This exhibition, which features experiences that demonstrate how Pixar filmmakers use computational thinking and creativity to approach complex artistic and technical challenges, used several distinct engagement strategies and pedagogical approaches to guide exhibit design.
