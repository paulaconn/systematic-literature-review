It is important to understand the challenges involved in GSEE for improving the quality and experience of educators and students. This paper reports the findings of an empirical study on the socio-cultural aspects of GSEE. A case study was conducted involving 14 participants from ten different universities in eight countries. The data was analyzed using grounded theory's open coding procedure. The key contributions of this paper are the identification and description of seven dimensions of socio-cultural distance that caused several significant challenges in the courses: 1) language differences; 2) concept of time; 3) attitude toward grades; 4) assumptions about national culture; 5) differences in autonomy; 6) influence of the course lecturer; and 7) work habits. Recommendations from this paper that are expected to benefit GSEE educators and students include: cross-cultural orientation of students prior to the course; use of various strategies to support better comprehension of different English accents (e.g., speaking slowly, replaying recorded video messages, and text chatting); and educators familiarizing themselves and their students with the relevant GSE and GSEE literature.","0018-9359;00189359","","10.1109/TE.2016.2624742","Project ¿¿¿NeXGSD¿¿¿; 10.13039/501100001537 - University of Auckland; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7755765","Curriculum design;design projects;experiential learning;global software engineering (GSE);grounded theory;higher education;software engineering (SE) education;teamwork","Context;Cultural differences;Global communication;Software;Software engineering;Training","computer science education;software engineering","GSEE;cross-cultural orientation;global software engineering education;open coding procedure;socio-cultural challenges","","","","","","","20161123","Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

And, although, several SE games have been evaluated adopting diverse research designs and measurements, so far no larger scale study across different games has been conducted. In this respect, this article presents a comprehensive analysis in order to summarize empirical evidence on the benefits of digital and non-digital games used for SE education. The analysis is based on data collected from 43 case studies that use MEEGA, the most commonly used model for educational game evaluation, evaluating 20 different SE games, involving a total population of 723 students. Our analysis indicate evidence that digital and non-digital games can yield a positive effect on the learning of SE, providing a pleasant and engaging experience to the students and motivate them. Our analysis also points out that non-digital games more easily seem to promote a more positive experience, principally in terms of fun and social interaction than the digital ones used for teaching SE. These results may guide SE instructors in the selection of educational games as instructional methods and guide game creators with respect to the development of new games.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2671-9; POD:978-1-5386-2672-6","10.1109/ICSE-SEET.2017.18","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7964340","Empirical evidence;SE game;evaluation","Computational modeling;Context;Games;Q-factor;Software engineering;Training","computer aided instruction;computer games;computer science education;software engineering","MEEGA;SE games;digital games;educational game evaluation;games quality;nondigital games;social interaction;software engineering education;software engineering teaching","","","","","","","","20-28 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Kim","Department of Computer Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul, Korea","IEEE Access","20170520","2015","3","","793","804","Games have been an important tool for motivating undergraduate students majoring in computer science and engineering. However, it is difficult to build an entire game for education from scratch, because the task requires high-level programming skills and expertise to understand the graphics and physics. Recently, there have been many different game artificial intelligence (AI) competitions, ranging from board games to the state-of-the-art video games (car racing, mobile games, first-person shooting games, real-time strategy games, and so on). The competitions have been designed such that participants develop their own AI module on top of public/commercial games. Because the materials are open to the public, it is quite useful to adopt them for an undergraduate course project. In this paper, we report our experiences using the Angry Birds AI Competition for such a project-based course. In the course, teams of students consider computer vision, strategic decision-making, resource management, and bug-free coding for their outcome. To promote understanding of game contents generation and extensive testing on the generalization abilities of the student's AI program, we developed software to help them create user-created levels. Students actively participated in the project and the final outcome was comparable with that of successful entries in the 2013 International Angry Birds AI Competition. Furthermore, it leads to the development of a new parallelized Angry Birds AI Competition platform with undergraduate students aiming to use advanced optimization algorithms for their controllers.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2442680","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIP) (2013 R1A2A2A01016589); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7130561","Angry Birds;Artificial intelligence (AI);Computing education;Game;Game competition;Game-based learning;Program design;artificial intelligence (AI);edutainment;game;game competition;game-based learning;program design","Artificial intelligence;Computer science education;Education;Entertainment;Game theory;Learning systems","artificial intelligence;computer aided instruction;computer games;computer science education;computer vision;decision making;educational courses;further education","Angry Birds AI competition;advanced optimization algorithms;bug-free coding;computer vision;game AI competitions;game artificial intelligence education;project-based course;resource management;strategic decision-making;undergraduate students","","0","","35","","OAPA","20150622","2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Unfortunately, data scientists with the analytical and software engineering skills to analyze these large data sets have been hard to come by; only recently have software companies started to develop competencies in software-oriented data analytics. To understand this emerging role, we interviewed data scientists across several product groups at Microsoft. In this paper, we describe their education and training background, their missions in software engineering contexts, and the type of problems on which they work. We identify five distinct working styles of data scientists: (1) Insight Providers, who work with engineers to collect the data needed to inform decisions that managers make; (2) Modeling Specialists, who use their machine learning expertise to build predictive models; (3) Platform Builders, who create data platforms, balancing both engineering and data analysis concerns; (4) Polymaths, who do all data science activities themselves; and (5) Team Leaders, who run teams of data scientists and spread best practices.

The results of this study reveal several factors that can prevent sustainability design from becoming a first class citizen in software engineering: software practitioners tend to have a narrow understanding of the concept of sustainability; organizations show limited awareness of its potential opportunities and benefits; and the norms in the discipline are not conducive to sustainable outcomes.

Learners who have had no previous practical experience in defining requirements may follow a recommended procedure in order to elicit requirements. We have implemented two types of role-play training - with and without software agents' support. Twelve undergraduate students from the School of Computer Science at the Tokyo University of Technology participated in an experimental assessment of these two types of role-play training. The results of a subsequent questionnaire survey and portfolio evaluation of the goal model diagrams developed by the students showed that their requirements modeling skill levels had improved. However, because some students may have had no prior business experience, each role-play scenario needs to be carefully designed so that all necessary information regarding the strategy or vision in the problem domain is clearly laid out.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5598-2; POD:978-1-5090-5599-9","10.1109/TALE.2016.7851799","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7851799","KAOS;goal modeling;requirements engineering","Companies;Requirements engineering;Software agents;Software systems;Training","computer based training;computer science education;educational institutions;formal specification;groupware;software agents","School of Computer Science;Tokyo University of Technology;business knowledge;customer real requirements;domain expert;goal model diagrams;group-work role-play training;portfolio evaluation;requirements engineering education;requirements modeling skill levels;software agent;undergraduate students;universities","","","","","","","","7-9 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally hardware experiments dominate the electronics engineering laboratory work. Course on Mobile communications has problems due to limited scope of available hardware especially for students' conceptual learning. As a result, the lab work in the Mobile Communications course is carried out using simulation software such as Matlab, Scilab etc. Students are able to verify various concepts studied in theory using these simulations. The problem of using these software simulations is that the students focus shifts from understanding the concepts underlying the experiment to writing the Matlab or Scilab code. We carried out a pilot study to address this problem using the new technology Virtual Laboratories available online. In this paper we present the results of the pilot study carried out with 150 students at UG level and 18 students at PG level in an autonomous college under university of Mumbai using Mobile Communications Virtual laboratory. The results indicate an increase in the students' understanding of core concepts such as frequency reuse, channel fading and various handoff strategies. The students' have given a positive feedback in the course exit survey regarding their experience with the new lab format. They find working with these labs more interesting and motivating.

In general, these games do not allow students to create agile process models or experiment with process improvement strategies. We are creating a serious game that will serve as a virtual learning environment to allow students to explore agile process improvement practices. Our game is designed as a single-player game where the player takes the role of software team leader and plays against an AI (artificial intelligence) opponent representing the customer's interests and needs. Players are rewarded for developing project strategies that allow for completion of projects on time, within budget, and meet the necessary software quality requirements.

This demand requires engineers with specialized skills and knowledge. For this, the higher education institutions are developing training strategies aimed primarily at lectures and laboratory practices. However, these strategies are insufficient for the development of technical and social skills required by engineers. In addition, currently there is a lack of a common framework to facilitate teaching-learning process and achievement of learning objectives. In this paper, the authors present a proposal for representation of teaching and learning practices about embedded systems, which have been oriented to track and encourage competency development. The proposal is based on the SEMAT kernel as universal framework for representing software engineering practices, defining an extension to such kernel. In addition, a methodology is proposed with a practical approach for creating theories related to computing, this methodology is used to define an extension of the SEMAT kernel for another discipline domain. In this paper, a first form of general representation of teaching and learning practices about embedded system is proposed. The proposal includes the minimum elements that should have any practice of teaching and learning about embedded systems, and the extension mechanisms to represent specific elements.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1074-5; POD:978-1-5090-1075-2","10.1109/CONISOFT.2016.15","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7477909","SEMAT kernel;embedded system;learning;practice;teaching","Education;Embedded systems;Kernel;Proposals;Software engineering;Stakeholders","embedded systems;further education;teaching","SEMAT kernel;competency development;embedded systems;higher education institutions;laboratory practices;learning practices;lectures;social skills;software engineering practices;teaching-learning process;universal framework","","","","32","","","","27-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The majority of the courses that have undergone this change use applied learning strategies and include a significant “learning-by-doing” component. The research in this area is skewed towards such courses and in general there are many considerations that educators ought to account for if they were to move to this form of teaching. Introductory courses in computer programming can appear to have all the elements needed to move to a flipped environment; however, initial observations from our research identify possible pitfalls with the assumption.

The Department of Software Engineering at Rochester Institute of Technology introduced an activity in their Freshman Seminar course to help students work in a team-based environment. The specific focus was interacting with problematic team members. This team activity involved student “moles” covertly being inserted to act in a disruptive fashion. At the end of the activity, the teams reassembled to discuss the task the team had been assigned to do. The instructor revealed the role of the “moles” at this point, and the teams discussed the effect their behaviors had on team effectiveness and the strategies used to deal with the disruptive behaviors.

To address these challenges, the Nonlinear and Autonomous Systems Laboratory (NAS Lab) at Michigan Tech has designed two types of UGs for concept development, testing, and problem solving, and additionally, for scaffolding advanced interest and education in engineering. The first, a Glider for Underwater Presentation and Promoting Interest in Engineering (GUPPIE), nationally targets high school students and undergraduates to provide these students a UG platform for hands-on experience in concept development, testing, and problem solving. The second platform is a Glider for Autonomous Littoral Underwater Research (GALUR). At 10% of the cost of current models, the GALUR was designed to serve as a low cost multivehicle control testbed for disparate research groups who need to test and validate control algorithms. Still a highly-maneuverable UG, the GALUR allows researchers to address underwater communication issues by implementing control strategies for individual and multiple vehicle underwater data collection and mapping. Through the process of developing and testing these two UGs, the research team is ultimately working toward their long term goal of developing a fleet of low cost highly maneuverable underwater gliders.

A humanoid robotics workshop is included as a part of the curriculum of `Industrial Robotics' in the Industrial Engineering. This workshop covers one third of the laboratory practices of this subject. A constructivist view for learning is adopted, whereby robotic technologies are not seen as mere tools, but rather as potential vehicles of new ways of thinking about teaching, learning and education at large. Students, in a constructivist learning environment, are invited to work on experiments and authentic problem-solving; with selective use of available resources according to their own interests, research and learning strategies. The authors, as trainers of this workshop, chose ROBONOVA humanoid robots, among other devices, which attempt to partner technology with ideas of constructivism. The materials used in the workshop offer building parts, sensors thus connecting a robot with the external environment and programming software with a simple graphical interface intended for the creation of robot behavioral movements. The idea is “learning by design”, which is central in the constructivist pedagogy introduced firstly by Resnick. In this workshop we corroborate this idea through the project-based learning approach in robotics. Learning tasks of the workshop are organized as projects (small and large) that encourage students to develop their own designs.

"Today's workforce in tomorrow's smart grid: Bridging the growing gaps","S. Varadan","","2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","20121110","2012","","","1","1","Summary form only given. In the light of the ongoing activities related to the “smart grid”, the perception that today's utility workforce is woefully inadequate and not up to par has gained considerable bite. As the discussions around smart grid have evolved, the industry, espoused by the US-DOE, has reached a consensus and formally defined the requirements for tomorrow's smart grid. Yet, it is not clear what exactly is expected of tomorrow's workforce. Should there be an emphasis on power system engineering, communication technologies, green generation technologies, basic sciences, hardware, software, engineering management, or plain vanilla “soft” skills? Present trends in the industry including the aging asset base, aging workforce, integration of renewable and sustainable resources - all in the background of Smart Grid, make the discussions around what is expected of the future utility work force even more complicated. University faculty and industry personnel are trying to figure out the answers to the questions above and common themes are slowly emerging as there is no definitive consensus on the expected needs of the future utility workforce. Even so, the concept of holistic education and critical thinking seem to be recurring themes at all levels. Consensus about the importance of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is another point of convergence. Implementation of ICT in various business processes and the effective breaking down of silos is an underlying theme in leveraging critical data out of which meaningful information, and knowledge, may be extracted to effect local change but with global consequences. This paper provides a critical view of the gaps that need to be bridged to transition today's utility workforce in the wake of tomorrow's anticipated smart grid needs. Advertised utility positions, such as Manager, Smart Grid and Technology Integration Strategy and Systems Engineer, Power Systems & - mart Grid will be examined in detail as a means to develop a better sense of understanding of what, and how, utilities are doing to bridge the perceived gaps in today's and tomorrow's utility workforce. Efforts at leading universities, technical schools and government agencies (such as CEWD and NSF) are described as well. Certificate programs and new course curricula addressing a more holistic approach are presented. Another important aspect of these efforts is the way in which these new courses are delivered as technology has changed the way in which workers may be trained, or retrained, using the concepts of on-line and long-distance learning programs. These “learn at your own pace” courses are gaining popularity along with more traditional time-bound courses delivered in a class-room setting as more and more people are being drawn towards a career in the “electric” energy business.","1932-5517;19325517","Electronic:978-1-4673-2729-9; POD:978-1-4673-2727-5; USB:978-1-4673-2728-2","10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344686","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6344686","Smart Grid Training;Utility Workforce Needs","Aging;Business;Communications technology;Educational institutions;Industries;Smart grids","computer aided instruction;distance learning;educational courses;power engineering computing;power engineering education;smart power grids","ICT;US-DOE;aging asset base;aging workforce;business processes;communication technology;electric energy business;government agencies;green generation technology;information and communication technology;long-distance learning programs;online learning programs;power system engineering;sustainable resources;technology integration strategy;tomorrow smart grid;utility workforce","","1","","","","","","22-26 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Software Engineering education, in Brazil, offers qualifications at all levels: undergraduate, further education and postgraduate. However, current market demand indicates a mismatch between the academic provision and the industrial demand. To address this mismatch, it is important to take into account the large geographic distribution of Brazil and its regional inequalities. We suggest that innovative strategies in education including Distance Education, Open Education and Open Educational Resources will need to play an important role in the future of professional qualifications in Brazil. This raises opportunities and challenges that can only be addressed by a strong interdisciplinary research and political agenda. This paper discusses the scenario of the Software Engineering education in Brazil and presents research questions and political issues associated with the future of human resource qualification in this area.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4868-5; POD:978-1-4673-4472-2","10.1109/SBES.2012.19","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6337871","Software engineering;distance education;human resource qualification;open educational resources;professional education","Context;Educational institutions;Humans;Industries;Qualifications;Software engineering","computer science education;distance learning;further education;human resource management;qualifications;software engineering","Brazil geographic distribution;Brazil regional inequality;educational advance;further education level;human resources qualifications;innovative strategy;open education;open educational resources;political issues;postgraduate level;software engineering education;technological advance;undergraduate level","","2","","35","","","","23-28 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally cyber security research and education has been founded on information assurance, expressed in underlying subfields such as forensics, network security, and penetration testing. Cyber security research and education is connected to the homeland security agencies and defense through funding, mutual interest in the outcome of the research, and the potential job market for graduates. The future of cyber security is both defensive information assurance measures and active defense driven information operations that jointly and coordinately are launched, in the pursuit of a cohesive and decisive execution of the national cyber defense strategy. The cohesive cyber defense requires universities to optimize their campus wide resources to fuse knowledge, intellectual capacity, and practical skills in an unprecedented way in cyber security. The future will require cyber defense research teams to address not only computer science, electrical engineering, software and hardware security, but also political theory, institutional theory, behavioral science, deterrence theory, ethics, international law, international relations, and additional social sciences. This paper is the result of an ocular survey of the U.S. 48 academic CAE-R research centers, evaluating the collective group of research centers' ability to adapt to the shift towards cyber operations, and the challenges therein.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2104-4; POD:978-1-4673-2105-1","10.1109/ISI.2012.6284146","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6284146","CAE-R;center of academic excellence;cyber education;cyber operations;cyberdefense;cyberwar;defense;information assurance;information operations","Computer aided engineering;Computer science;Computer security;Educational institutions;International relations","computer science education;educational institutions;further education;industrial property;national security;security of data","academic cyber security education;academic cyber security research;behavioral science;computer science;cyber operations;deterrence theory;electrical engineering;ethics;forensics;hardware security;homeland security agencies;information assurance;institutional theory;intellectual capacity;international law;international relations;knowledge fusion;national cyber defense strategy;network security;penetration testing;political theory;social sciences;software security","","4","","3","","","","11-14 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many online software systems such as WebCT, Blackboard, Angel, etc., are easily used by distance education instructors to develop and deploy non-technical courses, which do not necessarily require extensive hands-on labs. However, in engineering technology disciplines, laboratory experiments serve as the essential tools for relating the theoretical concepts to the real world solutions. Thus, the incorporation of hands-on lab work in an online program becomes a significant challenge to engineering and technology educator. This paper addresses this challenge with a hybrid strategy.

Problem-based learning (PBL) was used as an instructional strategy of active learning, and adapted for use in the Lighting Design course. The students are presented with a virtual scenario, quite similar to the real world, where they are required to perform as they would in a real life situation. The emphasis is given to PBL so that they can learn to become autonomous, skilled and explore their own potential as well as improve team work skills/spirit and that can be applied to a wide range of students and subject matters. PBL is introduced to the students as a `learn by doing' project. The project incorporates aspects of electrical engineering and computing skills. This study analyses the learning process/techniques that help students deal with the complexity of a Lighting Design Project and assesses its effectiveness and impact on the students. Essentially, it encourages them to be in charge of their education. The benefits of PBL in the Lighting Design course are visible in the improvement of the study and analysis of a Lighting Design project.

Kulakowski","The Pennsylvania State University, Mechanical Engineering Department, University Park, PA 16802","1988 American Control Conference","20090310","1988","","","1612","1618","The list of basic problems which have to be addressed in teaching fundamentals of automatic control has remained largely unchanged for the last several decades. Students beginning their education in automatic control are still taught how to determine system stability, or how to achieve satisfactory steady-state and transient performance at the same time. The strategy applied in developing a new Automatic Control Laboratory in the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the Pennsylvania State University was to present the same classical problems using modern, attractive digital hardware and software. Each experimental set-up in the laboratory is equipped with an individual AT&T 6300 personal computer and printer. The computer system is used for data acquisition, monitoring, and control of the experiments and is thus replacing many devices such as oscilloscopes, function generators, strip chart and x-y recorders, traditionally used in student laboratories. As a result, the use of personal computers with A/D and D/A interface not only brings the elements of attractive technique to the laboratory but it is also cost efficient. The processes studied in a one-credit undergraduate course, Automatic Controls Laboratory, include position and velocity control with d.c. motors, pneumatic servomechanism, and electric air heater. A mixture of commercial and in-house software is available for data acquisition, system analysis and design. Due to the considerable flexibility of the digital equipment, the laboratory is also used in a variety of individual independent study projects as well as in a graduate course on digital process control.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4789979","","Automatic control;Control engineering education;Data acquisition;Hardware;Laboratories;Mechanical engineering;Microcomputers;Printers;Stability;Steady-state","","","","2","","1","","","","15-17 June 1988","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal is to help students improve their problem solving skills, as well as to assist teachers to monitor student response so that guidance can be provided as required. Complex and tedious processes are often encountered in curricula such as physics, chemistry, and mathematics, where the final answer is built upon the results of numerous smaller processes. Therefore the process analyzer defines the top-level process as a hierarchy composed of smaller integral parts so that students who are not able to solve the problem on their own are able to look at lower-level simpler processes and follow the hints leading to the correct answer. Question designers can define hints, as well as the score in each step. Responses are recorded for modeling student performance. The students interact with the Process Analyzer through a graphical interface, which provides an engaging and motivating environment. The positive feedback on our process analyzer shows the feasibility of our approach.

The current talk reports on work that starts with a pressing social problem - the problem of maximizing equity and excellence in K-12 education - and one strategy for addressing this problem - the development of mobile, wirelessly connected tools to support classroom learning. It mentions the development and use in real classrooms of two suites of such tools (one for middle school math and one for 5-11 th grade science). The practice of using these wirelessly connected, mobile devices raised important theoretical issues about the nature of coordination and the computational support for coordination. We have been using tuple spaces (a framework for allocating work between parallel distributed actors) to build systems that explore the opportunistic control of the individual over their own actions, socially emergent negotiation of system goals and coordinative practices, and the relationship between content and coordination. These control structures and the contribution of the machine as compared to human participants are better described by analogy to playground games than to work situations. This analogy (along with the values it presupposes) is at variance with the object world of software engineers, which foregrounds the capabilities of the machine rather than the situation of use.","","POD:0-7695-2942-9","10.1109/PLT.2007.31","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4488853","","Control systems;Educational institutions;Humans;Mobile computing;Pressing","computer aided instruction;mobile computing;mobile radio","K-12 education;classroom learning;computational coordination support;tuple spaces;wireless mobile devices","","0","","","","","","4-5 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some software engineering instructors have incorporated projects that either simulate product development for a corporate customer or have students work directly with corporate sponsors to solve a problem or produce an artifact. The rationale for the activity is to provide ""real world"" experience, a foretaste of what a professional in the field will be asked to do. Other instructors may forgo the project as taking too much time from an already full curriculum or due to the difficulty of making and maintaining corporate connections. They rely on the lecture format to convey the material. Are there other reasons for including ""project-type"" activities in software engineering instruction over and above the practical experience they provide? Are there reasons to try to incorporate strategies other than lecture into courses?

Experience in teaching has shown that a complementary approach combining theoretical and practical exercises is vital for effective learning. Increasingly, teaching institutions are offering remote access to distant laboratories as part of an overall e-learning strategy. Remote experimentation provided as part of a Web-based learning approach affords a number of critical benefits, allowing flexible access to on-campus resources free of time or geographical constraints. In the context of distance learning it can be the only realistic method of performing experiments. However adapting and redeveloping existing software and hardware resources to this purpose is both time consuming and expensive. An innovative simple approach to this problem is presented in this paper. The remote desktop method offered here allows students to have full access to existing on-campus laboratory resources remotely but without substantial implementation and development overheads incurred by the providers.

It draws from a large scale research program funded by the European Union and Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), into the emerging ASP industry where software is delivered as a service, priced on a per-seat, per month basis. Tracking a taxonomy of ASPs (pure-play, vertical, horizontal, enterprise and enabler) through longitudinal case study research, the paper suggests that two major inhibitors have contributed to the slow growth of this market. The first is economic conditions evidenced by the dot.com downturn, and the second is lack of education in the potential customer marketplace. The paper tracks the strategies of two major players within the ASP industry: Cable & Wireless, a traditional UK telecoms company moving into the IP market, and Jamcracker, a recently established US enterprise web services company. Through careful evaluation of key performance indicators (KPIs) for evaluating ASPs and customer perceptions of the software-as-a-service proposition (and e-business broadly conceived), the paper argues what integration of applications will be the major challenge if the ASP business model is to survive in the overcrowded and intensely competitive e-business sector.","","POD:0-7695-1435-9","10.1109/HICSS.2002.994341","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994341","","Application software;Application specific processors;Business;Communication industry;Companies;Computer industry;Councils;Inhibitors;Large-scale systems;Taxonomy","business data processing;information systems;outsourcing","Cable & Wireless;Jamcracker;application service provider business model;e-business;economic conditions;key performance indicators;longitudinal case study research;potential customer marketplace;software-as-a-service proposition","","9","","20","","","","7-10 Jan. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Part of that evolution is an increased appreciation for the diverse body of knowledge software developers must possess. Learning software development skills requires more than merely participating in design projects and managing technical details. Design projects provide a context within which the social and technical aspects of software engineering become visible, yet the legal issues involved in software engineering may not be fully addressed. This lack of coverage of legal issues is the result of the fragmented placement of topics in the curriculum. We are addressing this failure by constructing modules, consisting of scenarios, for our software engineering course to cover the critical legal issues with which our students need to be familiar. These modules can be used independently of particular courses. The first modules are covered, and include 1) intellectual property, 2) privacy, and 3) theories of liability. We describe the importance of legal topics in software engineering education, offer a preliminary view of the content of the modules, provide an overview of the scenario construction strategy, and provide a glimpse into the methods we use to refine the scenarios we develop","0190-5848;01905848","POD:0-7803-6424-4","10.1109/FIE.2000.897563","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=897563","","Intellectual property;Law;Legal factors;Privacy;Programming;Project management;Software development management;Software engineering;Software systems;Systems engineering education","computer science education;educational courses;industrial property;legislation;software engineering","design projects;intellectual property;legal issues;liability theory;privacy;social aspects;software development skills learning;software engineering course;software engineering education;technical aspects","","1","","23","","","","2000","18 Oct 2000-21 Oct 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In an economy characterized by global competition and continuous change, students need career-sustaining skills in addition to hard knowledge. They must know how to synthesize and integrate information; to work together in teams; to be creative; to attack open, multidisciplinary problems; to communicate the answers obtained; and to bring ideas into fruition. Recent critiques of engineering education, state the need a slightly different way. They claim that engineering education has focused too much of its energy on engineering science at the expense of engineering design. The author considers how Georgia Tech's EduTech Institute is spearheading an interdisciplinary effort to address these needs. Key to the effort is a two-quarter pre-disciplinary introduction to design. The introductory courses are designed to lay the foundations for teaming principles and strategies behind good design, reasoning involved in doing design, and cognitive and social skills a designer needs.

Blais and his staff began a process of reviewing, developing and testing a series of courses that incorporated the skills needed in engineering with the latest high-technology equipment and software. He and his department were supported by a Technology Advisory Board that he established in order to gain the expertise of people in industry and to garner support for the changes that were to be implemented in the curriculum. The members of the board went beyond their initial objectives, locating funds to help purchase equipment and materials for the program in its experimental stage. Over the next three years it became apparent that the program was attracting an increasing number of students, many who would not have enrolled in any technology course until college. Project Lead The Way has been presenting its program to selected schools in New York State and New Hampshire.

However, the accumulated calling and computing of SMT solvers are time and resource consuming. This paper presents TsmartLW, an alternate static analysis tool in which we implement a path constraint solving engine to speed up reachability determination. Within the engine, typical types of constraint-patterns are firstly defined based on an empirical study of a large number of code repositories. For each pattern, a constraint solving algorithm is designed and implemented. For each program, the engine predicts the most suitable strategy and then applies the strategy to solve path constraints. The experimental results on some well-known benchmarks and real-world applications show that TsmartLW is faster than some state-of-the-art static analysis tools. For example, it is 1.32× faster than CPAchecker and our engine is 369× faster than SMT solvers in solving path constraints.

The problem of choosing the “best” sequence of agents to achieve the optimal social welfare has been investigated and conjectured to be NP-hard. We propose a simple parallel allocation protocol that is insensitive to agents’ identities. In every round of the parallel allocation process, every agent asks for an object among those that remain, and every reported object will be allocated randomly to an agent reporting it. Supposing additive utilities and independence between the agents, we compare the average (and worst-case) social welfare achieved by a parallel protocol and a sequential protocol. Theoretical and empirical results show that parallel protocol outperforms a sequential protocol (even when the best sequence of agents is applied). We also show that under the parallel mechanism, some manipulation problems (e.g., finding a successful strategy for a target set and finding an optimal strategy under some scoring function) can be solved in polynomial time.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2764093","Innovation Project of GUET Graduate Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8070933","Distributed resource allocation;manipulation problem;parallel protocol;social welfare","Computer science;Cost accounting;Electrical engineering;Manipulators;Protocols;Resource management;Software","","","","","","","","","20171018","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, our objectives are to achieve the tracking control of multi-point temperature, ensure the global temperature uniformity, and enhance the system adaptivity for deviation of the temperature detecting position in the microwave heating system with the input constraints. Therefore, a multirate simple adaptive control strategy based on almost strictly positive real (ASPR) conditions is proposed, which multirate sampling and lifting technique is used to solve the case that the system has less inputs than outputs.

To increase the robustness and reliability in coverage and tracking tasks using multiple Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), several criteria must be taken into consideration, like safe separation between the vehicles and complete area coverage based on their on board sensors. In this context, we propose a guidance strategy where initially a straight line path between previously calculated waypoints for coverage tasks is calculated. Then, for each next turn of the vehicle, a goal point is chosen in order to minimize a deviation error from the straight line path and the current position of the vehicle. In order to calculate this point, an offline lookup table is created, which correlates the underlying control model with the turn angles; during flight, the best value is chosen for each next turn. The algorithm has been tested in different scenarios and against a robust simulation framework by the means of Software-in-the-Loop (SITL). The results show that this strategy manages to provide a computationally inexpensive method for the goal points of the pure pursuit algorithm and minimizes the deviation from the straight line trajectories of the waypoint planning.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-0939-2; POD:978-1-5386-0940-8; USB:978-1-5386-0938-5","10.1109/RED-UAS.2017.8101643","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8101643","","Minimization;Pursuit algorithms;Sea measurements;Sensors;Tracking;Trajectory","","","","","","","","","","3-5 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to address this problem, a research project with the following objectives was proposed: 1. To determine the key focus areas and stakeholders for e-Readiness in South African Higher Education, and 2. To illustrate these key focus areas and stakeholders, and show how they relate to one another in a model for e-Readiness in South African Higher Education. A two-round Delphi questionnaire was conducted with South African universities' Information Technology directors, South African National Research and Education Network managers and Association of South African Information Technology Directors managers. The main outcomes that were achieved were: 1. New definitions for e-Readiness and e-Learning were posited, 2. The key focus areas for e-Readiness were determined as: Information, Infrastructure and Human Capital, 3. Key stakeholders and their proposed key roles were determined, 4.

In the third configuration, by embracing the reality that vertical and horizontal planes dominate the indoor environment, an infrared depth camera is employed to determine surface normals and thereby provide attitude aiding.

It addresses the two key challenge problems on the sensorless control of the BLDC motor. The one is presenting a novel detection method for the BLDC motor rotor position signal to filter out the interference and the noise by the high frequency. The other one is proposing a commutation error compensation strategy to improve the system efficiency. In traditional sensorless control strategy, a deep low pass filter is usually used to obtain the BLDC motor rotor position signal from the high frequency interference. However, the delayed angle caused by the low pass filter may be more than 90 electrical degrees in the high speed range. Therefore, a novel sensorless control strategy based on the speed–independent flux linkage function was proposed in this paper. The interference of the diode freewheeling was filtered by the software filter, and a closed–loop compensation algorithm based on the deviation of line–to–line voltages was illustrated to correct the commutation error in the high speed range. The stability and accuracy of the method was confirmed by a series of experiments.","0885-8993;08858993","","10.1109/TPEL.2017.2765355","Cultivation and Development Project of Science and Technology Innovation Base of Beijing; Innovation Capacity Improvement Project of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education under Grant; Opening Foundation of Beijing Engineering Research Center under Grant; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8078265","BLDC motor;commutation error;flux linkage function;sensorless control strategy","Brushless DC motors;Commutation;Couplings;Error compensation;Rotors;Sensorless control;Synchronous motors","","","","","","","","","20171023","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In fact, by focusing on the self-similarity of the input data and the possibility to delegate blindly the solution of subproblems, pupils were able to recognize the heuristic potential of recursion. We started with an unplugged activity using LEGO bricks where a recursive algorithm was executed by pupils, and we continued with an activity supported by a software tool we developed ad-hoc.

While industry surveys or industrial case studies are preferred to evaluate industrial applicability, controlled experiments with student participants are commonly used to determine measurements such as effectiveness and efficiency of a proposed approach. [Objectives] In this paper, we elaborate on the current state of the art of controlled experiments using student participants. As threats regarding the generalizability are quite obvious, we want to determine how widespread controlled experiments with student participants are and in which settings they are used. [Methods] This paper reports on a systematic mapping study using requirements engineering specific conferences and a journal as data sources. We scanned requirements engineering papers published in the years 2010-2015 and investigated all papers reporting student experiments in detail. [Results] From 444 papers under investigation 31 report results from controlled experiments. Regarding threats to validity it can be observed that most papers report on threats to validity and commonly different categories of threats to validity are thoroughly discussed.

In this model, based on the individual utility, the strategy state will be asynchronously updated according to the Fermi-like rule. Among them, each individual will be initially endowed with an integral reputation value, and then it evolves during the evolution of strategy; while for the individual utility, it is characterized as the product of the game payoff and a power function of reputation value. Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method is adopted here to verify the system's evolutionary characteristics, and large quantities of simulations demonstrate that the cooperation behavior can be greatly varied and enhanced when the reputation is incorporated into the utility evaluation. Detailed strategy distribution proves that the individual with large reputation value renders the cooperators to lower their risks to be reaped by defectors, and dominates the evolution of cooperation within the whole population. In addition, the whole cooperation phase diagrams show that the coexistence region of cooperators and defectors becomes narrower and narrower as the reputation is introduced more and more. Meanwhile, it is also displayed that the reputation effect favors the evolution of cooperation, and greatly fosters the cooperators to form the compact clusters so as to reduce the risk of being invaded by defectors. To summarize, current results are conducive to making a deeper insight into the evolution of collective cooperation within many real-world biological and man-made systems.","1932-8184;19328184","","10.1109/JSYST.2016.2539364","Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars (Ministry of Education); 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC); 10.13039/501100002858 - China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7448876","Cooperation risk analysis;promotion of cooperation;public goods game (PGG);reputation effect;spatial reciprocity","Analytical models;Evolution (biology);Games;Lattices;Risk analysis;Sociology","Monte Carlo methods;economics;evolutionary computation;game theory;risk analysis;utility theory","Fermi-like rule;MCS;Monte Carlo simulation;PGG;cooperation yielded;evolutionary game;individual utility;risk analysis;risk enhancement;spatial public goods game;utility evaluation","","","","","","Traditional","20160407","Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Here, the network topology is directed and described by a generalized Laplacian matrix L. An individual dynamical system can adopt its own state feedback control law such as a linear-quadratic-regulator controller for an ample stability margin, but it may lose the stability margin to a great extent when the same control strategy utilizing relative state information is used after being interconnected with other dynamical systems. This paper reveals and elaborates upon the following four facts: First, the stability margin after interconnection is quantified via the minimum singular value of a frequency-dependent matrix made up of F and L; Second, the stability margin of a networked dynamical system having a pole at the origin is at most the inverse of the zero-eigenvalue sensitivity of L; Third, there exists an upper bound of the stability margin that has a computational merit, and asymptotically converges to the exact margin with respect to network size, probability of link existence, and control gain in a random network setting; and finally, L can be designed to maximize the stability margin.

Most of the instructional strategies used to help students take advantage of these activities focus on supporting agile programming, which is appropriate for capstone courses. This is not always recommended in initial software engineering project courses, however, where novice developers run projects in teams while simultaneously taking other courses. To enhance the learning and teamwork experience in this latter instructional scenario, this paper proposes a formative monitoring method, reflexive weekly monitoring (RWM), for use in project courses that involve disciplined software processes and loosely coupled work. RWM uses self-reflection and collaborative learning practices to help students be aware of their individual and team performance. RWM was applied in a case study over nine consecutive semesters. The results obtained indicate that RWM was effective in enhancing the learning experience in the instructional scenario studied.

An optimal selection model of CU depth is established to estimate the range of candidate CU depth by exploiting the temporal correlation of CU depth among current CU and temporally co-located CUs. To reduce the accumulated errors in the process of CU depth prediction, the maximum depth of the co-located CUs and the coded block flag (CBF) of the current CU are used. Moreover, PU size and CBF information are also used to decide the maximum depth for the current CU. Experimental results show that the proposed CU depth decision approach reduces 56.3% and 51.5% average encoding time, and the Bjontegaard delta bit rate increases only 1.3% and 1.1% for various test sequences under the random access and the low delay B conditions, respectively.","0018-9316;00189316","","10.1109/TBC.2017.2704423","Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7940104","CU depth;High efficiency video coding (HEVC);coding unit (CU);prediction unit (PU)","Adaptation models;Bayes methods;Complexity theory;Copper;Correlation;Encoding;Video coding","encoding;video coding","Bjontegaard delta bit rate;CBF;CU depth prediction;H.264-AVC high profile;adaptive inter CU depth decision algorithm;coded block flag;coding efficiency;coding unit;computational complexity;encoding parameters;hierarchical coding structure;hierarchical unit partitioning strategy;high efficiency video coding;optimal selection model;prediction unit;temporal correlation","","","","","","","20170606","Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

On the centralized charging side, an offline optimal scheduling approach is first presented, aiming at minimizing the energy cost while satisfying the charging requirements of EVs. To deal with the system dynamics and uncertainties, a model predictive control-based adaptive scheduling strategy is then developed to determine the near optimal EV charging profiles in real time. On the decentralized charging side, the interactions between EVs and the charging system controller is modeled as a leader-follower noncooperative Stackelberg game in which the system controller acts as the leader and the EVs act as followers. The existence of the equilibrium state and its optimality are proved and analyzed. It is shown that by adopting the proposed decentralized charging algorithm, the communication burden between EVs and the system controller is low and that the charging scheme is robust to poor communication channels. Last, we investigate how the size of these two charging groups impacts the system utility and propose an algorithm maximizing the total revenues of the whole system. Simulation results evaluate the performances of the scheme and investigate the parameters' impacts on the system utilities. The proposed approach and obtained results may provide guidelines for improving the efficiency of the charging park operation and provide useful insights, helping the system operator develop rational investment strategies","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2017.2668443","10.13039/501100001459 - Ministry of Education, Singapore; 10.13039/501100004608 - Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7852525","Electric vehicles (EVs);Stackelberg game;hybrid centralized-decentralized charging;model predictive control (MPC)","Control systems;Games;Power grids;Predictive control;Robustness;Uncertainty;Vehicle dynamics","adaptive scheduling;electric vehicles;game theory;power control;power generation scheduling;power grids;predictive control","electric vehicles;hybrid centralized-decentralized charging control;leader-follower noncooperative Stackelberg game;model predictive control-based adaptive scheduling strategy;offline optimal scheduling approach;power grid;system utilities","","","","","","","20170213","Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Storage-Tag-Aware Scheduler for Hadoop Cluster","N. M. F. Qureshi; D. R. Shin; I. F. Siddiqui; B. S.

Apache Hadoop is an open-source ecosystem that manages large data sets in a distributed environment. MapReduce is a programming model that processes massive amount of unstructured data sets over Hadoop cluster. Recently, Hadoop enhances its homogeneous storage function to heterogeneous storage and stores data sets into multiple storage media, i.e., SSD, RAM, and DISK. This development increases the performance of data block placement strategy and allows a client to store large data sets into multiple storage media efficiently than homogeneous storage. However, this evolution increases the consumption of computing capacity and memory usage over MapReduce job scheduling. The scheduler processes MapReduce job into homogeneous container having configuration of CPU, memory, DISK volume, and network I/O, and accesses, processes, and stores data sets over heterogeneous storage media. This produces a processing latency of locating and pairing source data set to MapReduce tasks and results an abnormal high consumption of computing capacity and memory usage in a Datanode. Similarly, when scheduler assigns MapReduce jobs to multiple Datanodes, the same processing latency can severely affect the performance of whole cluster. In this paper, we present Storage-Tag-Aware Scheduler (STAS) that reduces processing latency by scheduling MapReduce jobs into heterogeneous storage containers, i.e., SSD, DISK, and RAM container. STAS endorses job with a tag of storage media, such as JobSSD, JobDISK, and JobRAM and parses them into heterogeneous shared-queues, which assign processing configuration to enlist jobs. STAS manager then schedules shared-queue jobs into heterogeneous MapReduce containers and generates an output into storage media of the cluster. The experimental evaluation shows that STAS optimizes the consumption of computing capacity - nd memory usage efficiently than available schedulers in a Hadoop cluster.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2725318","10.13039/501100003725 - Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea through the Ministry of Education; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7976300","HDFS;Hadoop;MapReduce;scheduler;storage-tier","Containers;Ecosystems;Media;Memory management;Programming;Random access memory;Schedules","Big Data;data analysis;parallel processing;public domain software;scheduling;storage management","Apache Hadoop;Big Data analytics;CPU;DISK volume;Datanode;Hadoop cluster;MapReduce job scheduling;STAS;data block placement strategy;data set storage;distributed environment;heterogeneous MapReduce containers;heterogeneous shared-queues;heterogeneous storage media;memory;multiple storage media;network I/O;open-source ecosystem;processing configuration;programming model;shared-queue jobs;storage-tag-aware scheduler;unstructured data set processesing","","","","","","OAPA","20170712","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, in the fuzzy setting, game graphs are yet to be addressed, although some practical applications, such as modeling fuzzy systems that interact with their environments, appeal to such models. To fill the gap, in this paper, we propose a fuzzy version of game graphs and focus on the fuzzy game graphs with reachability objectives, which we will refer to as fuzzy reachability games (FRGs). In an FRG, the goal of one player is to maximize her truth value of reaching a given target set, while the other player aims at the opposite. In this framework, we show that FRGs are determined in the sense that for every state, both of the two players have the same value, and there exist optimal memoryless strategies for both players. Moreover, we design algorithms, which achieve polynomial time complexity in the size of the FRG, to compute the values of all states and the optimal memoryless strategies for the players. For a special class of FRGs, we provide an improved algorithm that achieves linear-logarithmic running time to compute the values of states. In addition, several examples are given to illustrate our motivation and the theoretical development.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2016.2593495","Higher School Doctoral Subject Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002858 - China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7517395","Fuzzy automaton;fuzzy logic;fuzzy transition system (FTS);game graph;reachability","Automata;Computational modeling;Computer science;Fuzzy systems;Games;Stochastic processes;Uncertainty","computational complexity;fuzzy set theory;game theory;probability;reachability analysis","FRGs;computer science;formal verification;fuzzy game graphs;fuzzy reachability games;linear-logarithmic running time;optimal memoryless strategies;polynomial time complexity;probabilistic versions;reactive systems;two-player turn-based games","","","","","","","20160720","Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The notion of input-to-state practical stability is introduced to evaluate the dynamical performance of the controlled systems with considering the effects from both exogenous disturbances and event-triggered scheme. The estimations of the upper bounds for the system state and the measurement error are employed to analyze and further exclude the Zeno behavior for the proposed event-triggered scheme.

As outsourcing is now well established the switching of vendors and transitioning from one system to another is common. However, most of the research to date on outsourcing has focused on the decision and operation phases, leaving a gap between theory and practice concerning the transition phase. Transition in outsourcing entails the changing of systems, business processes and/or vendors. If a suitable transition approach is not applied pressures for another transition can immediately build. This paper presents results from a case study carried out on the 'Novopay Project' in which the Ministry of Education in New Zealand changed their vendor from an onshore to a near-shore provider. This project resulted in a sequence of three transitions, with each following a different approach as a direct result of the experiences encountered in the previous transition. In this research we made use of the rich 'data dump' of evidence provided by the Ministry of Education (MoE). Our analysis describes how a client organization can become trapped in a continuous transition cycle if a suitable approach is not applied. Transition1 involved the client - MoE - moving from complete outsourcing to selective insourcing. After realizing that they did not have the capabilities to manage insourcing, Transition2 was initiated. In Transition2 the sourcing approach reverted back to complete outsourcing. When it was realized that the new vendor in Transition2 could not in fact deliver a new service model or support end-users in following new business processes, Transition3 was initiated. In Transition3, the client established an internal company to insource service operations to support end-users. Transition can be a sound business strategy initiated for a range of reasons. However, if a flawed sourcing approach is chosen it can result in 'continuous transition'.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1587-4; POD:978-1-5386-1588-1","10.1109/ICGSE.2017.6","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7976686","Novopay Project;continuous transition;outsourcing;switching of vendors;transition","Contracts;Data analysis;Organizations;Outsourcing;Software engineering;Switches","business data processing;outsourcing","Ministry of Education;MoE;Novopay Project;business processes;business strategy;continuous transition cycle;data dump;insource service operations;near-shore provider;outsourcing;selective insourcing;service model","","","","","","","","22-23 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Unimodal Stopping Model-Based Early SKIP Mode Decision for High-Efficiency Video Coding","Y. Li; G. Yang; Y. Zhu; X. Ding; X. Sun","School of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China","IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","20170615","2017","19","7","1431","1441","High-efficiency video coding (HEVC) can greatly improve coding efficiency compared with the prior video coding standard H.264/AVC by adopting advanced hierarchical coding structures such as coding unit (CU), prediction unit (PU), and transform unit. For each CU, an exhaustive mode decision strategy is adopted to achieve the best rate distortion (RD) cost, which simultaneously results in enormous computational complexity. In this paper, an early SKIP mode decision algorithm is proposed for the HEVC encoder to speed up the process of mode decision. Each CU size is categorized into either rare used or frequent used by exploiting the correlation of CU depth, which is estimated from the temporally colocated CUs.

For the frequent-used CU size, a unimodal stopping model is designed for its early SKIP mode decision by exploiting both hierarchical mode structure and RD cost property. Experimental results show that the proposed early SKIP mode decision method achieves average 58.5% and 54.8% encoding time savings, while the Bjontegaard Delta bit rate only increases average 0.8% and 0.8% for various test sequences under the random access and the low delay B conditions, respectively.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2017.2669863","Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center on Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higer Education Institutions; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7857045","High efficiency video coding (HEVC);SKIP mode;mode decision;unimodal stopping model (USM)","Computational complexity;Copper;Correlation;Encoding;High efficiency video coding;Video sequences","computational complexity;rate distortion theory;video coding","Bjontegaard Delta bit rate;HEVC encoder;computational complexity;early SKIP mode decision;hierarchical coding structures;high-efficiency video coding;rate distortion cost;unimodal stopping model","","","","","","","20170215","July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the proposed method, the intensity component is obtained adaptively from the upsampled MS image at first. Different from traditional IHS-based methods, we subsequently propose a multiscale guided filter strategy to filter the PAN image to achieve more detail information. Finally, the total detail map is injected into each band of the upsampled MS image to obtain the fused image by a model-based algorithm, in which an improved injection gains approach is proposed to control the quantity of the injected detail information.

Therefore, it is also called big social networking services. In order to motivate users of online social networks to share information and communicate with each other frequently, we first analyzed the activity statuses of users in one of famous social networks, Weibo, and then proposed a lurker game model for accumulating big data. In addition to the features of the public goods game, this model also introduces the factor of individual incentive depending on his degree. We found that the individual strategy to be chosen was not relevant to the user's degree, but to an incentive constant of the entire network. The simulation results showed that individual strategies asymptotically followed three different behaviors according to the dynamic organization of the individuals. Active users will emerge during the evolutionary process with an incentive. Without an incentive, active central users can hardly affect the states of their neighbors and may even become lurkers due to the large number of lurking neighbors. Large noise decreases the influence of the high incentive and causes the chaos of networks. If the continuous chaos exists, active users will gradually lose interest and leave the network.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2626079","Key Scientific Research Fund of Sichuan Education Department; Shaanxi Department of Science and Technology; 10.13039/100010144 - Scientific Research Foundation of Chengdu University of Information Technology; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7736998","Social network;big data analytics;common goods game;complex network;evolutionary game","Analytical models;Big data;Chaos theory;Complex networks;Computer science;Games;Social network services","Big Data;evolutionary computation;game theory;social networking (online)","Big Data;Weibo;activity dilemmas;big social networks;evolutionary process;incentive constant;lurker game model;online social networks;social networking services","","","","","","OAPA","20161107","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the dorsal hand vein is usually captured by near-infrared (NIR) sensors and the resulting image is of low contrast and shows a very sparse subcutaneous vascular network. Therefore, it does not offer sufficient distinctiveness in recognition particularly in the presence of large population. This paper proposes a novel approach to hand-dorsa vein recognition through matching local features of multiple sources. In contrast to current studies only concentrating on the hand vein network, we also make use of person dependent optical characteristics of the skin and subcutaneous tissue revealed by NIR hand-dorsa images and encode geometrical attributes of their landscapes, e.g., ridges, valleys, etc., through different quantities, such as cornerness and blobness, closely related to differential geometry. Specifically, the proposed method adopts an effective keypoint detection strategy to localize features on dorsal hand images, where the speciality of absorption and scattering of the entire dorsal hand is modeled as a combination of multiple (first-, second-, and third-) order gradients. These features comprehensively describe the discriminative clues of each dorsal hand. This method further robustly associates the corresponding keypoints between gallery and probe samples, and finally predicts the identity. Evaluated by extensive experiments, the proposed method achieves the best performance so far known on the North China University of Technology (NCUT) Part A dataset, showing its effectiveness. Additional results on NCUT Part B illustrate its generalization ability and robustness to low quality data.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2360894","French Research Agency (Agence Nationale de Recherche, ANR); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Joint Project by the LIA2MCSI Laboratory between the Group of Ecoles Centrales and Beihang University; National Basic Research Program of China; Research Program of State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100005089 - Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6919302","Hand-dorsa vein recognition;multilevel keypoint detection;optical properties of dorsa hand subcutaneous tissue;oriented gradient maps (OGMs)","Biomedical optical imaging;Detectors;Feature extraction;Optical imaging;Optical scattering;Skin;Veins","image matching;vein recognition","Hand-Dorsa vein recognition;NCUT;NIR;North China University of Technology;differential geometry;dorsal hand images;dorsal hand vein;liveness detection;local feature matching;multisource keypoints;near-infrared sensors;optical characteristics;people identification;sparse subcutaneous vascular network","","7","","39","","","20141009","Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The voltage stability of these operating conditions may be very different from the more traditional power consumption regime. This paper focuses on the demonstration of multistability phenomenon in radial distribution systems with reversed power flow where multiple stable equilibria coexist for the given set of parameters. The system may experience transitions between different equilibria after being subjected to disturbances such as short-term losses of distributed generation or transient faults. Convergence to an undesirable equilibrium places the system in an emergency or in extremis state. Traditional emergency control schemes are not capable of restoring the system if it gets entrapped in one of the low voltage equilibria. Moreover, undervoltage load shedding may have a reverse action on the system and can induce voltage collapse. We propose a novel pulse emergency control strategy that restores the system to the normal state without any interruption of power delivery. The results are validated with dynamic simulations of IEEE 13-bus feeder performed with SystemModeler software. The dynamic models can also be used for characterization of the solution branches via a novel approach, so-called the admittance homotopy power flow method.","1949-3053;19493053","","10.1109/TSG.2015.2419880","Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Skoltech and Masdar Initiatives; Ministry of Education and Science of Russian Federation; Vietnam Educational Foundation; 10.13039/100000001 - National Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7093184","Load flow;load modeling;power distribution faults;power distribution protection;power system control;power system dynamic stability","Load modeling;Low voltage;Power system control;Power system stability;Transient analysis","load flow control;load shedding;power distribution control;power distribution protection;power system dynamic stability;power system restoration;power system simulation;power system transient stability;reactive power control","IEEE 13-bus feeder dynamic simulations;SystemModeler software;admittance homotopy power flow method;distributed generation grids;multiple stable equilibria;power flow reversal;pulse emergency control;radial distribution systems;reactive power compensation;transient faults;undervoltage load shedding;voltage collapse;voltage multistability","","3","","29","","","20150423","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We model collaboration within this framework as a decision-making problem in which agents have to determine what capabilities to learn and from which agents to learn them so that they can form teams that have the capabilities required to perform the current tasks satisfactorily. Our proposed technique refers to principles from human learning theory to enable an agent to strategically select appropriate capabilities to learn from other agents. We also use two openness parameters to model the dynamic nature of tasks and agents in the environment. Experimental results within the Repast agent simulator show that by using the appropriate learning strategy, the overall utility of the agents improves considerably. The performance of the agents and their utilities are also dependent on the repetitiveness of tasks and reencounter with agents within the environment. Our results also show that the agents that are able to learn more capabilities from another expert agent outperform the agents who learn only one capability at a time from many agents, and agents who use an intelligent utility maximizing strategy to choose which capabilities to learn outperform the agents who randomly make the learning decision.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMC.2013.2285527","COMRADES Project funded by the Office of Naval Research; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6651856","Ad hoc networks;collaborative work;learning;multiagent systems","Collaboration;Education;Multi-agent systems;Protocols;Robots;Software agents","decision making;digital simulation;groupware;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems","Repast agent simulator;ad hoc environments;decision-making problem;distributed collaboration;human learning theory;intelligent utility maximizing strategy;multiagent collaboration;multiagent task execution scenario;openness parameters;strategic capability-learning;task repetitiveness","","2","","18","","","20131101","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Previous studies have shown that compared with non-adaptive strategies, this content adaptive strategy achieves stronger security against existing steganalysis. Based on the experiments and analyses, however, we found that this embedding property would inevitably lead to a large limitation in existing adaptive steganography. That is, it is possible for steganalyzers to estimate the regions that have probably been modified after data hiding. In this paper, we propose an adaptive steganalytic scheme based on embedding probabilities of pixels. The main idea of our scheme is that we assign different weights to different pixels in feature extraction. For those pixels with high embedding probabilities, their corresponding weights are larger, since they should contribute more to steganalysis and vice versa. By doing so, we can concentrate our attention on the regions that have probably been modified and significantly reduce the impact of other unchanged smooth regions. It is expected that our proposed method is an improvement on the existing steganalytic methods, which usually assume every pixel has the same contribution to steganalysis. The extensive experiments evaluated on four typical adaptive steganographic methods have shown the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, especially for low embedding rates, for example, lower than 0.20 bpp.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2507159","Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation; Shenzhen Research and Development Program; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7350138","Adaptive Steganalysis;Adaptive Steganography;Adaptive steganography;Embedding Probabilities;Re-Embedding;adaptive steganalysis;embedding probabilities;re-embedding","Adaptation models;Correlation;Distortion;Feature extraction;Image edge detection;Security;Sun","image coding;probability;steganography","adaptive steganalytic scheme;image steganography;pixel embedding probability","","","","29","","","20151209","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A reflection mechanism is used to abstract the resource scheduling process as a metaobject. Petri nets are used to construct the base layer model, meta layer model, metaobject protocol, and other components, thus forming the resource scheduling model. The adaptive resource scheduling strategy is converted into CTL formulas, and the properties are analyzed. Meanwhile, an enforcement algorithm is proposed, which can guarantee the correct behavior of cloud computing while meeting the required reliability within deadline constraints. The operational semantics and related theories of Petri nets help prove its effectiveness and correctness. We have also performed a series of simulations to evaluate our approach.

These NVM technologies have attractive features, such as low latency and high throughput to satisfy application performance. Accordingly, fast storage devices based on fast NVM lead to a rapid increase in the demand for diverse computer systems and environments (e.g., cloud platforms, web servers, and database systems) where they are expected to be used as primary storage. Despite the promised benefits provided by fast storage devices, modern file systems do not take advantage of the storage's full performance. In this article, we analyze and explore existing I/O strategies in read, write, journal I/ O, and recovery paths between the file system and the storage device. The analysis shows that existing I/O strategies are an obstacle to get maximum performance of fast storage devices. To address this issue, we propose efficient I/O strategies that enable file systems to fully exploit the performance of fast storage devices.

Digital signature is a widely used technique to protect messages' authenticity and nodes' identities. From the practical perspective, to ensure the quality of services in wireless mobile networks, ideally the process of signature verification should introduce minimum delay. Batch cryptography technique is a powerful tool to reduce verification time. However, most of the existing works focus on designing batch verification algorithms for wireless mobile networks without sufficiently considering the impact of invalid signatures, which can lead to verification failures and performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a Batch Identification Game Model (BIGM) in wireless mobile networks, enabling nodes to find invalid signatures with reasonable delay no matter whether the game scenario is complete information or incomplete information. Specifically, we analyze and prove the existence of Nash Equilibriums (NEs) in both scenarios, to select the dominant algorithm for identifying invalid signatures. To optimize the identification algorithm selection, we propose a self-adaptive auto-match protocol which estimates the strategies and states of attackers based on historical information.

Integration of KBs has attracted much attention as different KBs usually contain overlapping and complementary information. Automatic techniques for KB integration have been improved but far from perfect. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of knowledge base semantic integration using crowd intelligence. There are both classes and instances in a KB, in our work, we propose a novel hybrid framework for KB semantic integration considering the semantic heterogeneity of KB class structures. We first perform semantic integration of the class structures via crowdsourcing, then apply the blocking-based instance matching approach according to the integrated class structure. For class structure (taxonomy) semantic integration, the crowd is leveraged to help identifying the semantic relationships between classes to handle the semantic heterogeneity problem. Under the conditions of both large scale KBs and limited monetary budget for crowdsourcing, we formalize the class structure (taxonomy) semantic integration problem as a Local Tree Based Query Selection (LTQS) problem. We show that the LTQS problem is NP-hard and propose two greedy-based algorithms, i.e., static query selection and adaptive query selection. Furthermore, the KBs are usually of large scales and have millions of instances, direct pairwise-based instance matching is inefficient. Therefore, we adopt the blockingbased strategy for instance matching, taking advantage of the class structure (taxonomy) integration result. The experiments on real large scale KBs verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2017.2656086","Hong Kong RGC; Microsoft Research Asia Fellowship; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China; Shandong Province Higher Education Institutions; 10.13039/501100001809 - NSFC; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Science Foundation of China (NSFC); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828140","Knowledge base;crowdsourcing;data integration","Computer science;Crowdsourcing;Data integration;Knowledge based systems;Ontologies;Semantics;Taxonomy","computational complexity;crowdsourcing;data integration;greedy algorithms;knowledge based systems;query processing;semantic Web;trees (mathematics)","KB class structures;LTQS problem;NP-hard problem;adaptive query selection;automatic KB integration techniques;blocking-based instance matching approach;class structure semantic integration problem;crowd intelligence;crowdsourcing;greedy-based algorithms;hybrid framework;integrated class structure;knowledge base semantic integration;local tree based query selection problem;semantic Web;semantic heterogeneity problem;semantic relationships;static query selection","","","","","","","20170120","May 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Educators should also provide students with ways of gathering client information. However, to be effective in this regard, there is the need that students interact with clients. Our pedagogical strategy is designed to tackle these challenges.

However, almost all the existing RFID estimation protocols are dedicated to the estimation problem on a single set, regardless of tag categories. A feasible solution is to separately execute the existing estimation protocols on each category. The execution time of such a serial solution is proportional to the number of categories, and cannot satisfy the delay-stringent application scenarios. Simultaneous RIFD estimation over multiple categories is desirable, and hence, this paper proposes an approach called simultaneous estimation for multi-category RFID systems (SEM). SEM exploits the Manchester-coding mechanism, which is supported by the ISO 18000-6 RFID standard, to decode the combined signals, thereby simultaneously obtaining the reply status of tags from each category. As a result, multiple bit vectors are decoded from just one physical slotted frame. Built on our SEM, many existing excellent estimation protocols can be used to estimate the tag cardinality of each category in a simultaneous manner. To ensure the predefined accuracy, we calculate the variance of the estimate in one round, as well as the variance of the average estimate in multiple rounds. To find the optimal frame size, we propose an efficient binary search-based algorithm. To address significant variance in category sizes, we propose an adaptive partitioning (AP) strategy to group categories of similar sizes together and execute the estimation protocol for each group separately. Compared with the existing protocols, our approach is much faster, meanwhile satisfying the predefined estimation accuracy. For example, with 20 categories, the proposed SEM+AP is about seven times faster than prior estimation schemes. Moreover, our approach is the only one whose normalized esti- ation time (i.e., time per category) decreases as the number of categories increases.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2016.2594481","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Japan Ministry of Information and Communication through the Strategic Information and Communications Research and Development Promotion Program titled ¿Living Activity and Health Tracking in Smart Home using RF Reflection and Big Data,¿ 2016-2018; Jiangsu Future Internet Program; Jiangsu High-Level Innovation and Entrepreneurship (Shuangchuang) Program; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Advanced Networking, Tianjin, China; 10.13039/100000001 - NSF; 10.13039/501100001809 - NSFC; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - State Key Program of National Natural Science of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7574264","Manchester coding;RFID;adaptive partitioning;cardinality estimation;multi-category","Computer science;Electronic mail;Encoding;Estimation;IEEE transactions;Protocols;Radiofrequency identification","protocols;radiofrequency identification","ISO 18000-6 RFID standard;Manchester-coding mechanism;RFID estimation protocols;adaptive partitioning strategy;multicategory RFID estimation;multicategory radio frequency identification estimation","","1","","","","","20160922","Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Heating Dispersal for Self-Healing NAND Flash Memory","R. Chen; Y. Wang; D. Liu; Z. Shao; S. Jiang","School of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Application, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China","IEEE Transactions on Computers","20170116","2017","66","2","361","367","Substantially reduced lifetimes are becoming a critical issue in NAND flash memory with the advent of multi-level cell and triple-level cell flash memory. Researchers discovered that heating can cause worn-out NAND flash cells to become reusable and greatly extend the lifetime of flash memory cells. However, the heating process consumes a substantial amount of power, and some fundamental changes are required for existing NAND flash management techniques. In particular, all existing wear-leveling techniques are based on the principle of evenly distributing writes and erases. For self-healing NAND flash, this may cause NAND flash cells to be worn out in a short period of time. Moreover, frequently healing these cells may drain the energy quickly in battery-driven mobile devices, which is defined as the concentrated heating problem. In this paper, we propose a novel wear-leveling scheme called DHeating (Dispersed Heating) to address the problem. In DHeating, rather than evenly distributing writes and erases over a time period, write and erase operations are scheduled on a small number of flash memory cells at a time, so that these cells can be worn out and healed much earlier than other cells. In this way, we can avoid quick energy depletion caused by concentrated heating. In addition, the heating process takes several seconds and has become the new performance bottleneck. In order to address this issue, we propose a lazy heating repair scheme. The lazy heating repair scheme can ease the long time delays caused by the heating via delaying the heating operation and using the system idle time to repair. Furthermore, the flash memory's reliability becomes worse with the flash memory cells reaching the excepted worn-out time. We propose an early heating strategy to solve the reliability problem. With the extended lifetime provided by self-healing, we can trade some lifetimes for reliability. The idea is to start the healing process earlier than the expected worn-out time- We evaluate our scheme based on an embedded platform. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can effectively prolong the consecutive heating time interval, alleviate the long time delays caused by the heating, and enhance the reliability for self-healing flash memory.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2016.2595572","Chongqing High-Tech Research Program; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Guangdong Natural Science Foundation; National 863 Program; Natural Science Foundation of SZU; Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China; Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China; Shenzhen Natural Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002369 - Chongqing; 10.13039/501100002369 - Chongqing University; 10.13039/501100004377 - Hong Kong Polytechnic University; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524803","Flash memory;dispersed heating;power consumption;self-healing;wear leveling","Delay effects;Heating;Logic gates;Maintenance engineering;Reliability;Silicon;Substrates","NAND circuits;circuit reliability;flash memories;heating","DHeating;NAND flash management;embedded platform;heating dispersal;lazy heating repair scheme;reliability enhancement;self-healing NAND flash memory;wear-leveling scheme","","","","","","","20160728","Feb. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Especially for project management training, simulation games are helpful. Students can try out different management strategies and gain experience without endangering real projects. To provide a good learning environment, it is important to simulate the employees managed by the player as realistically as possible. However, existing approaches only use simple models to simulate human behavior, missing psychological aspects like motivation and interpersonal interaction, and therefore are not detailed enough for leadership and project management training. We present a new decision-making model based on findings of psychology, which can be used for simulating a more realistic human behavior. We use heuristics for calculating the motivational force of all potential actions an employee has, in order to decide which he will choose. This calculation is not only based on the project's state and schedule, but also on emotional factors like the preferences and aversions of the employee. Within our approach, we implemented a decision-making model, which is not limited to our game concept and can also be adapted for other simulation games.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-4160-8; POD:978-1-5090-2203-8","10.1109/GAS.2016.010","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809510","Human behavior;Project management;Simulation;Simulation games;Software engineering education","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Decision making;Education;Games;Knowledge based systems;Software engineering","behavioural sciences computing;computer based training;computer games;management training;personnel;project management;teaching","decision-making model;emotional factors;employee aversions;employee preferences;human behavior modeling;leadership training;management strategies;project management training;psychology;software engineering simulation games","","","","","","","","16-16 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is evidence that personality traits influence the perceived usability of a software. Thus, to support beginners better, we need to understand how theworkflow of people with different prevalent personality traits using these tools varies. For this purpose, we observed users' solution strategies and correlated them with their prevalent personality traits in an exploratory study with student participants within a controlled experiment. We gathered data by screen capturing and chat protocols as well as a Big Five personality traits test. We found strong correlations between particular personality traits and different strategies of removing the findings of static code analysis as well as between personality and tool utilization. Based on that, we offer take-away improvement suggestions.

Despite its importance, many junior developers lack sufficient testing education and expertise. When faced with a task they are unfamiliar with, developers often use online resources to find code for adaptation or reference. Code search engines and repository mining tools have been created to assist developers, particularly less experienced ones, with finding solutions to common coding problems. However, many of these search engines lack the capability to facilitate test case searches. This has prevented developers from taking advantage of the massive analytical knowledge embodied in test cases written by other developers. In this paper we introduce TestEX, a web-based test case search engine designed to make finding useful test cases easier for developers. The strength of TestEX is the combination of three unique strategies for providing developers with useful and relevant test cases: (i) test-case identification within source code, (ii) test case categorization, and (iii) semantic mapping to the concern being searched via TestEX. Through the paper we present TestEX's Architecture, features and potential use cases. Furthermore, we report a study which was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our test case search engine.

Research studies have shown that assessment methods also influence students' learning. Current assessment techniques, even those which include technology, focus more on summative assessment rather than formative. Formative assessment is necessary for teaching and assessment of complex skills like troubleshooting or network design. Therefore, there exists a need for assessments to capture students' problem solving process and chosen approaches during the assessment. By tracking a student's behaviors in an immersive assessment environment, the path that the student takes towards the solution can be studied. Virtual Worlds are naturally immersive environments and can be effectively used to record interactions that students made in the worlds. We have developed NetWorld in Open Wonderland, an open source software for creating 3D virtual worlds. NetWorld is a 3D virtual world built for detailed assessment of computer network concepts for computer science undergraduate students. This detailed assessment happens at 3 levels -- conceptual understanding, diagnostic abilities and the ability to design a network.

A main issue is to support learners setting up their own learning goals, managing their own resources, including spaces and time, and monitoring and reflecting about their performance. Time management plays a main role in this approach. During the last years many web tools and mobile apps have been developed to support students managing their agendas, recording the time they devote to different activities and visualizing it in attractive graphics. In general these systems provide a view of the activities performed by the student in a particular system and the time devoted to each activity. In this paper we propose a contribution on this subject focused on two issues: self-regulation and interoperability. We are working towards the recording of online and offline student activities not just taking into account the functionalities or resources used, but also the goals, strategies, tasks or rewards considered from a SRL point of view.

We conducted a concurrent think-aloud to capture students' thinking while they were working on a design challenge using an educational computer-aided design (CAD) software. We showed how the design replays generated from the log files collected from the CAD software can be used to represent students' experimentation strategies and how these representations can be validated by the data collected from the think-aloud. Our preliminary results show that technology-based assessment by the educational CAD tool allows us to identify the differences between different experimentation strategies and that the result of this assessment is supported by the result obtained from the concurrent think-aloud.

In this paper, a two-granularity inspection-based software rejuvenation policy, which works as a closed-loop control technique, is proposed. This policy mitigates the negative impact of two-level software aging. The two levels considered are the user-level applications and the operating system. A Markov regenerative process model is constructed based on the system condition. We obtain the degradation rate of the application software and operating system from fault injection experiments. The diagnostic accuracy of the adopted monitor and analysis system, which is applied to inspect the application software and operating system, is considered as we provide the optimal rejuvenation strategies. Finally, the availability and the overall loss probability with their corresponding optimal inspection time intervals are obtained numerically based on the parameter values estimated from the experiments. Experimental results show that two-granularity software rejuvenation is much more effective than traditional single-level software rejuvenation. In our experimental study, when two-granularity software rejuvenation is used, the unavailability and the overall loss probability of the system were reduced by 17.9% and 2.65%, respectively, in comparison with the single-level rejuvenation.","0018-9529;00189529","","10.1109/TR.2016.2570539","Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project; Digital Confidence Plan (Digital Agency of Spain); Spanish National Institute of Cybersecurity (INCIBE); U.S. National Science Foundation; University of Le¿n; 10.13039/100006112 - Microsoft Research; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100003593 - CNPq; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7493613","Diagnostic accuracy;Markov regenerative process (MRGP);multigranularity software aging;overall loss probability;software rejuvenation","Aging;Analytical models;Computer bugs;Markov processes;Operating systems;Robustness","Markov processes;operating systems (computers);probability;software engineering","Markov regenerative process model;closed-loop control technique;operating system;overall loss probability;proactive software control technique;two-granularity software rejuvenation policy;two-level software aging;user-level applications","","","","","","","20160616","Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to the interdependence, node failures in one network may lead to failures of the other network and result in cascading failures of the whole system. One of the reasons for this phenomena is attributed to the connectivity of the interdependent system, which hinges heavily on the operation probability (or equivalently reliability) of networks in the light of node reliability. In this paper, we present the model of k-reliability, define cascading failures based on k-reliability, and propose an algorithm to calculate k-reliability for estimation of potential cascading failures. The proposed k-reliability, defined as the probability that at least k surviving nodes span an operating subnetwork, explains the operation probability of the system and reflects the connectivity of nodes in networks. In particular, we find that the network with regular interlink allocation strategy is homogeneous to the network with maximum k-reliability in class of graphs with 2n nodes and 2d edges when the information of intratopology is unknown. That is, regardless of the information of each individual network, the strategy that all nodes in the system are allotted the same number of bidirectional interlinks yields better performance on k- reliability than all other possible strategies both analytically and experimentally.","0018-9529;00189529","","10.1109/TR.2016.2606125","10.13039/100007219 - Natural Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100003395 - Shanghai Municipal Education Commission; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7572896","Cascading failures;cyber-physical system;k-reliability","Computer network reliability;Cyber-physical systems;Modeling;Power system faults;Power system protection;Telecommunication network reliability","cyber-physical systems;graph theory;software reliability;system recovery","bidirectional interlinks;cascading failures;cyber network overlays;cyber-physical system;interdependent system;k-reliability model;node failures;node reliability;operating subnetwork;operation probability;physical network;regular interlink allocation strategy;two interacting networks","","","","","","","20160921","Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In addition to addressing industry requirements in both contents and methodology, the course develops capabilities and competencies in problem solving, independent learning, teamwork, and technical knowledge. Since PBL methodology alone does not ensure teamwork, it was complemented with CL. Design review meetings (as described in IEC 61160), deliverables, and organizational resources were also introduced to mirror industry demands. This structure integrated course content and student academic achievement in a simulated industrial environment.

At the same time, the borderline between social networks and social media is more and more blurred. This complex and evolving scenario requires a new generation of computer scientists and engineers that understand how to properly design software for supporting and fostering social interactions.

While progress has been made, accurate detection of facial AUs remains challenging due to ubiquitous sources of errors, such as inter-personal variability, pose, and low-intensity AUs. In this paper, we refer to samples causing such errors as hard samples, and the remaining as easy samples. To address learning with the hard samples, we propose the confidence preserving machine (CPM), a novel two-stage learning framework that combines multiple classifiers following an “easy-to-hard” strategy. During the training stage, CPM learns two confident classifiers. Each classifier focuses on separating easy samples of one class from all else, and thus preserves confidence on predicting each class. During the test stage, the confident classifiers provide “virtual labels” for easy test samples. Given the virtual labels, we propose a quasi-semi-supervised (QSS) learning strategy to learn a person-specific classifier. The QSS strategy employs a spatio-temporal smoothness that encourages similar predictions for samples within a spatio-temporal neighborhood. In addition, to further improve detection performance, we introduce two CPM extensions: iterative CPM that iteratively augments training samples to train the confident classifiers, and kernel CPM that kernelizes the original CPM model to promote nonlinearity. Experiments on four spontaneous data sets GFT, BP4D, DISFA, and RU-FACS illustrate the benefits of the proposed CPM models over baseline methods and the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning and transfer learning methods.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2016.2594486","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment; 10.13039/100000002 - U.S. National Institutes of Health; 10.13039/100000025 - National Institutes of Mental Health; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100004543 - China Scholarship Council; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7523416","Transfer learning;confident classifiers;easy-to-hard;facial action unit (AU) detection;self-paced learning;semi-supervised learning;support vector machine (SVM)","Gold;Magnetic heads;Semisupervised learning;Standards;Support vector machines;Training","face recognition;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence)","BP4D;DISFA;GFT;QSS learning strategy;RU-FACS;automated facial expression analysis;confidence preserving machine;confident classifiers;facial AU;facial action unit detection;hard samples;inter-personal variability;iterative CPM;kernel CPM;low-intensity AU;person-specific classifier;quasi-semi-supervised learning strategy;spatio-temporal smoothness;two-stage learning framework;virtual labels","","","","","","","20160727","Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The efficiency of a hybrid PFS relies on the data layout schemes. However, most current layout strategies are designed for homogeneous servers, which neither address the heterogeneity of servers nor the varying access patterns of applications. In this paper, we propose HAS, a novel heterogeneity-aware selective data layout scheme for hybrid PFSs. HAS alleviates inter-server load imbalance through skewing data distribution on heterogeneous servers based on their storage performance. Furthermore, to obtain the optimal performance for a specific access pattern, HAS selects one static data layout policy with lowest access cost from three typical layout candidates as the final file data layout method. To adapt to the mixed access patterns within an application, HAS uses a dynamic data layout scheme, which stores file with multiple copies, each using a different data layout policy, and then selects the copy with the lowest access cost to serve file requests. We have implemented HAS within MPICH2 and OrangeFS. Experimental results show that HAS can significantly increase the I/O throughput of hybrid PFSs, compared to existing data layout optimization methods.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2015.2504969","China National Basic Research Program; HPCL; PhD Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China; SKLSE; 10.13039/100000001 - US National Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - NSFC; 10.13039/501100003819 - Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345596","Parallel I/O system;data layout;parallel file system;solid state drive","Bandwidth;Data models;Distributed databases;Layout;Servers;System performance;Throughput","disc drives;file servers;hard discs;parallel memories;performance evaluation","HDD servers;MPICH2;OrangeFS;SSD servers;access cost;data intensive applications;dynamic data layout scheme;heterogeneity-aware selective data layout scheme;hybrid PFS efficiency;hybrid parallel file systems;interserver load imbalance;parallel file system performance boosting;skewing data distribution;static data layout policy","","2","","","","","20151203","Sept. 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our results can be easily extended to other wireless mice using different radio links. We begin by presenting multiple ways to sniff unencrypted Bluetooth packets containing raw mouse movement data. We then show that such data may reveal text-based passwords entered by clicking on software keyboards.

Two inference strategies are used to discover passwords from cursor trajectories. We conducted a holistic study over all popular operating systems and analyzed how mouse acceleration algorithms and packet losses may affect the reconstruction results. Our real-world experiments demonstrate the severity of privacy leakage from unencrypted Bluetooth mice. We also discuss countermeasures to prevent privacy leakage from wireless mice.

However, obtaining and using suitable kits or hardware can involve significant financial outlay for a school. Additionally maintaining, storing and using the physical hardware presents many practical problems for teachers. These factors combine to create a significant entry barrier, especially for teachers who have previously not used robots and may be lacking confidence or motivation to use physical computing as a teaching aid. Robotic simulation provides a good alternative as it provides the experience and many of the benefits of working with robots to be gained at low cost, using computers already available in school. A software platform which meets this need is CoSpace Rescue. This has been created by Singapore Polytechnic as an educational tool and provides a simulation platform for RoboCupJunior. This platform allows students to experience event driven programming by developing search strategies to find and deposit coloured objects, whilst avoiding obstacles and traps. CoSpace was introduced to the UK in 2013 coincident with the introduction of a new compulsory national computing curriculum for England. The approach used to introduce CoSpace into schools and the relevance that CoSpace has to the new curriculum for England are presented in this paper. Four teams have now represented the UK at international RoboCupJunior competitions and the UK national competition, now in its third year, is already attracting over 100 competing teams with over 300 schools making use of the CoSpace Platform nationwide.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8633-3; POD:978-1-4673-8634-0","10.1109/EDUCON.2016.7474683","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7474683","CoSpace;Computer Science;Curriculum;Education;Rescue Robotics;RoboCupJunior;Simulation","Computational modeling;Programming profession;Robot sensing systems;Software","collision avoidance;mobile robots;search problems;teaching","CoSpace rescue;Singapore Polytechnic;UK national competition;compulsory national computing curriculum;computer science;computing teaching;educational tool;engineering;international RoboCupJunior competitions;obstacle avoidance;physical computing;physical hardware;robotic rescue simulation;search strategies;simulation platform;teaching aid","","","","12","","","","10-13 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, delivering the fundamental concepts in robotic (especially for serial robot manipulator) such as kinematics, dynamics, coordinate transformation and trajectory planning is neither easy nor fun like watching robot movies for the students. Apart from difficulty in grasping the mathematical concept and relate it immediately to robot practical behavior, visualizing the concept through conventional teaching approach is challenging. And due to the concern for safety of learners and damage to the machine, direct practical demonstration with real serial robot manipulator without exclusive supervision is restricted which by implication limits extend to which the students can explore the concepts on their own. In other to facilitate teaching and learning of the fundamental concepts and enliven learners' interest in the subject, there is need to review the pedagogy of teaching the subject through incorporation of latest tools especially technology tools available from time to time. In line with this, this paper presents experience in teaching robotics technology course to undergraduate engineering students at the college level with a blend of practical demonstration and use of MATLAB toolboxes simulation software in the course delivery. The course outlines, learning objectives, overview of the software tool and its essential features, series of learning activities adopted and assessment strategy are outlined.

Recently, the authors of this paper have developed a domain-specific modeling language approach and an associated web-based PBL application to support the development and delivery of online PBL modules in a cost-effective and flexible manner. In this paper, the authors emphasize to support peer assessment in an online PBL. Through using a peer assessment example, the authors present how to support teachers, who may not have a comprehensive technical knowledge, to specify a peer assessment process as a segment of a PBL script, a graphical representation of a PBL strategy. Then the PBL application can transform a PBL script that including the peer assessment into a formal model represented in an international e-learning technical standard IMS-Learning Design (IMS-LD). Finally, such a formal model can be executed in any IMS-LD compatible run-time environment.

In particular, universities have the power to improve the study skills of pupils at an early stage through the designed programs and measures. With the Pupils' Academy Serious Gaming, the Department of Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) has introduced an instrument to promote the study skills. This initiative aimed primarily at pupils of upper vocational schools (UVS). In addition to the study skills, thus the ability of more application-oriented knowledge transfer objectives and playful introduction to an important enterprise software can be achieved. This paper presents the Pupils' Academy based on the online SAP ERP Simulation Game ERPsim as an example of how the enterprise software SAP ERP is successfully applied to strengthen study skills. In addition, the pupils learn how to deal with the SAP platform and train skills like decision making, analysis, strategy development, data processing and presentation. The positive impact on study skills is evidenced with the help of a self-assessment by means of an IT-based survey carried out by the participating students.

China","IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","20160512","2016","42","5","490","505","Software testing aims to assure the quality of software under test. To improve the efficiency of software testing, especially regression testing, test-case prioritization is proposed to schedule the execution order of test cases in software testing. Among various test-case prioritization techniques, the simple additional coverage-based technique, which is a greedy strategy, achieves surprisingly competitive empirical results. To investigate how much difference there is between the order produced by the additional technique and the optimal order in terms of coverage, we conduct a study on various empirical properties of optimal coverage-based test-case prioritization. To enable us to achieve the optimal order in acceptable time for our object programs, we formulate optimal coverage-based test-case prioritization as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Then we conduct an empirical study for comparing the optimal technique with the simple additional coverage-based technique. From this empirical study, the optimal technique can only slightly outperform the additional coverage-based technique with no statistically significant difference in terms of coverage, and the latter significantly outperforms the former in terms of either fault detection or execution time. As the optimal technique schedules the execution order of test cases based on their structural coverage rather than detected faults, we further implement the ideal optimal test-case prioritization technique, which schedules the execution order of test cases based on their detected faults. Taking this ideal technique as the upper bound of test-case prioritization, we conduct another empirical study for comparing the optimal technique and the simple additional technique with this ideal technique. From this empirical study, both the optimal technique and the additional technique significantly outperform the ideal technique in terms of coverage, but the latter significantly outperforms the former two techniq- es in terms of fault detection. Our findings indicate that researchers may need take cautions in pursuing the optimal techniques in test-case prioritization with intermediate goals.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2015.2496939","National 973 Program of China; 10.13039/100000001 - National Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7314957","Empirical Study;Greedy Algorithm;Integer Linear Programming;Test-Case Prioritization;Test-case prioritization;empirical study;greedy algorithm;integer linear programming","Fault detection;Integer linear programming;Measurement;Schedules;Software;Software testing","integer programming;linear programming;program testing","ILP problem;integer linear programming;optimal coverage-based test-case prioritization;regression testing;simple additional coverage-based technique;software quality;software testing;test-case prioritization techniques","","1","","47","","","20151102","May 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Using a simple but realistic set of assumptions, we propose a general model for software testing and define sampling strategies for random (R) and systematic (S<sub>0</sub>) testing, where each sampling is associated with a sampling cost: 1 and c units of time, respectively. The two most important goals of software testing are: (i) achieving in minimal time a given degree of confidence x in a program's correctness and (ii) discovering a maximal number of errors within a given time bound n̂. For both (i) and (ii), we show that there exists a bound on c beyond which R performs better than S<sub>0</sub> on the average. Moreover for (i), this bound depends asymptotically only on x. We also show that the efficiency of R can be fitted to the exponential curve. Using these results we design a hybrid strategy H that starts with R and switches to S<sub>0</sub> when S<sub>0</sub> is expected to discover more errors per unit time. In our experiments we find that H performs similarly or better than the most efficient of both and that S<sub>0</sub> may need to be significantly faster than our bounds suggest to retain efficiency over R.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2015.2487274","SPECMATE; 10.13039/501100000781 - ERC; 10.13039/501100001459 - Singapore's Ministry of Education; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7289448","Efficient Testing;Error-based Partitioning;Partition Testing;Partition testing;Random Testing;Testing Theory;efficient testing;error-based partitioning;random testing;testing theory","Color;Input variables;Random variables;Software engineering;Software testing;Systematics","probability;program testing","automated software testing;exponential curve;hybrid strategy;probabilistic analysis;random testing;sampling strategies;systematic testing","","","","37","","","20151005","April 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Being apparently similar subjects they are quite contradictory in design flow level as a result of each technological area maturation state. As so, teaching methodologies are also very different, being challenging for both teachers and students. In fact, electronic design in the digital field is centered in the use of microprocessor and FPGA based circuits taking advantage from the relatively high level programing/configuring languages such as C or VHDL. Later on, at the debug stage, all changes will take place at software level only, being relatively easy to implement them. In a very different way, the analog design is traditionally based on the use of elementary components associated with macroblocks in order to built-up the wanted mission circuit. At the debug stage any circuit modification embraces necessarily some degree of hardware changing, with the all associated difficulties. As result, a massive share of electronic engineering students prefers to develop electronic work only at digital arena, generating um undesirable and unbalanced situation. This work relates the analog and digital design flow and proposes the use of analog programmable/configurable (e.g. FPAA, PSoC) circuits as a way to get the analog arena more attractive for electronic student and therefore balance analog and digital arenas at number of students level. This strategy, however, bring some drawbacks once it evolves the use of concepts not often taught in the traditional analog design classes. To surpass then is proposed the development of dedicated pedagogical materials making use of the ICT and including dedicated remote labs.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8246-5; POD:978-1-4673-8247-2; USB:978-1-4673-8245-8","10.1109/REV.2016.7444504","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7444504","Remote labs;configurable analog devices;e-learning","Capacitors;Design methodology;Education;Field programmable analog arrays;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Hardware design languages","analogue circuits;digital circuits;electronic engineering education;further education;teaching;virtual instrumentation","analog design;digital design;electronic engineering;higher-level education;remote labs;teaching","","","","16","","","","24-26 Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main reason is the services and sources provided the users by the clouds. In order to avoid over interactions of the servers and given the work volume and green computations, load balancing in cloud computing is of enormous importance requiring dynamic load distribution in a proportionate manner among the servers. Load balancing may reduce the used energy through avoiding over interaction between the nodes and virtual machines providing desired resource utilization. When a system fails, high costs are imposed on both server and customer, thus load balancing algorithm needs good fault tolerance. There are various techniques to increase fault tolerance. In this study task replication technique was used. To do so three fuzzy inference engines with an approach to fault tolerance for tasks prioritization, virtual prioritization and virtual machines as a goal for task replication were designed. Fuzzy method was selected because the question environment is uncertain and the parameters determination which is carried out by fuzzy method. In the proposed procedure by tasks and virtual priority, we could provide a proper work load distribution. The aim of this study was to present a novel strategy to improve load balancing for increasing fault tolerance and reducing energy consumption via ranking the tasks and virtual machines in cloud computing by fuzzy method.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6506-2; POD:978-1-4673-6507-9","10.1109/KBEI.2015.7436178","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7436178","Cloud computing;Energy consumption;Fuzzy method;fault tolerance;load balancing","Decision support systems;Engines;Fuzzy logic;Handheld computers;Pragmatics;Reliability;Virtual machining","cloud computing;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;resource allocation;software fault tolerance","cloud computing;dynamic load distribution;energy consumption;fault tolerance;fuzzy inference engines;fuzzy method;load balancing algorithm;task replication technique;tasks prioritization;virtual machines;virtual prioritization","","1","","22","","","","5-6 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a systematic approach to address the soft-error problem in multiprocessor system-on-chip with the consideration of system performance optimization. To guarantee the system correctness, a hardware-software collaborated approach is proposed to protect the processors from soft errors. Tiny hardware sensors are embedded in the processor cores to detect the soft errors, and the software-based rollback scheduling mechanisms are applied for error recovery. The protection costs on hardware duplication and software redundancy are effectively reduced. To optimize the system performance, a distributed control system is built on top of the on-chip communication network and collaboratively manages the entire chip for application execution. With the cluster-based task migration techniques, an efficient runtime task remapping and rescheduling algorithm is proposed to further mitigate the overheads induced by soft-error protection and to minimize the total performance degradation. The distributed control strategy makes the system more adaptable and flexible to the development of the next-generation hardware and software with larger scales. Extensive performance evaluations using SystemC-based cycle-accurate simulations on a set of real-world applications show that our approach has on average 49% performance improvement and 79.6% energy consumption reduction compared with the related state-of-the-art techniques, and hardware synthesis results show that our approach only introduces 2.9% chip area overheads.","1063-8210;10638210","","10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2452910","Chongqing High-Tech Research Program; Hong Kong Special Administrative Region; National 863 Programs; Public Sector Research Funding through the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7202910","Algorithm;distributed control;multiprocessor system-on-chip (MPSoC);network-on-chip (NoC);performance;soft-error;task migration;task migration.","Decentralized control;Hardware;Optimization;Processor scheduling;Program processors;Scheduling","distributed sensors;embedded systems;hardware-software codesign;integrated circuit design;integrated circuit reliability;network-on-chip;radiation hardening (electronics)","SystemC based cycle accurate simulations;cluster based task migration technique;distributed control strategy;distributed sensor network-on-chip;error recovery;hardware duplication;on-chip communication network;performance optimization;runtime task remapping;runtime task rescheduling;soft error detection;soft-error tolerant multiprocessor system-on-chip;software based rollback scheduling;software redundancy","","0","","35","","","20150814","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, assigning a groupwork task to a team of students does not guarantee a successful performance, and in fact could hinder the benefits of group learning if the members do not interact as expected. Indeed, group learning performance is largely dependent on group composition. In this work we address the challenge of identifying the characteristics of the individual group members that bare the significant impact on the performance of the groupwork. Specifically we investigate the impact that a combination of individual student performances and gender have on the group performance and intend to find generic segmentation guidelines that would map smoothly onto the groupwork performance. A novel grouping method is proposed, which splits the set of students into groups that maximize one of the two desired criteria: the expected average groupwork performance or the average improvement achieved by a student as a result of synergic group learning and interaction effects. The model uses global optimization approach to identify optimal students allocation into the groups that best satisfy the optimization criteria. We illustrate our findings on the data obtained from the trial of the Collaborative Learning Environment (CLE) software. The CLE was developed at Etisalat British Telecom Innovation Centre (EBTIC) and tested over one semester with a sample of 122 students working in different groups in the Engineering and Molecular Biology courses at Khalifa University.

Novice programmers suffer of a wide range of deficits due to defective training processes. We argue that the incorporation of experiences on mutation testing in programming courses adds valuable knowledge to the learning process. In this paper we evaluate the effects of using mutation testing to improve the learning process of students in programming courses. We present results of experiments and analysis involving undergraduate students. These experiments are the continuation of a previous work in which we raise empirical evidences that the adequate incorporation of mutation testing in programming courses contributes to form an effective environment that fosters learning. To do so, we provide a mutation testing tool to promote the practice of mutation testing by novice programmers. Through practical experiences and several analysis survey we measured the effects of using the mutation testing criterion to teach programming. In addition, we collected the opinion of senior students who already knew mutation testing concepts about their opinion on the usage of mutation concepts to teach novice programmers. Our findings reveal that the effective use of mutation analysis concepts contributes to the learning process, making students see the code as a product under development that is the result of a careful manual coding process which they need for measuring and predicting the effect of each command. The main contributions discussed in this paper are: (1) presenting results of an empirical analysis involving undergraduate students, thus giving us preliminary evidence on the effects of the novel practice; (2) exposing possible practices to explore mutation testing in programming classes, highlighting the limitations and st- engths of such strategy; and (3) a mutation testing tool for educational purposes.","","Paper:978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344051","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344051","computer-aided instruction;experimental study;mutation testing","Computers;Programming profession;Software;Software testing;Syntactics","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;further education;program testing;source coding","faulty programs;manual coding process;mutation testing;programming courses;software testing;undergraduate students","","1","","10","","","","21-24 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Analyzing the impact of asynchronous multimedia feedback on novice computer programmers","W. W. Schilling","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Milwaukee School of Engineering, Milwaukee, WI 53202","2015 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","20151207","2015","","","1","8","For many engineering students, freshman programming represents one of the hardest courses for them to master. Unlike other science fields, few students are routinely exposed to programming in the K12 system. This can make the freshman programming course daunting. However, in the field of software engineering, success in this area is vital, as success in nearly all future courses requires mastery of this skillset. In the engineering field, we find that many students are visual learners. These students learn best by seeing, and they can perform very well in the classroom with the appropriate usage of teaching styles. However, when it comes to providing feedback to students on submitted assignments, the main method employed is the written comment, which is not conducive to visual learners. From a faculty member's standpoint, this makes sense, as it is the simplest form of feedback. However, written feedback is often ineffective at improving student performance, as many students simply do not read the comments because the students feel they are not relevant to their performance. This can be compounded in the freshman year, as students are still learning what is meant to be an effective college student. At higher levels, an alternative feedback mechanism, namely asynchronous multimedia feedback, has shown great promise. In lieu of written feedback, students are provided feedback for software engineering exercises through the use of a short video made via video capture. The video captures in multimedia format the instructor's perceptions and actions when grading a given assignment. The video shows, in real time, what the instructor saw, whether it is a program crashing or the successful operation of the program. Furthermore, it provides the instructor the ability to potentially fix simple blatant errors and see the instructor's debugging strategy. The article describes the pedagogical foundation for the technique, specifics of the technique used, student perceptions o- the technique, and an assessment of the learning gains from using such a method in an introductory freshman programming course. In general, students are show to prefer the technique versus traditional grading, and a statistically significant improvement in overall outcomes for the experimental course is shown to exist. A statistically significant correlation between the watching of videos and outcomes is also shown.","","Paper:978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344103","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344103","assessment;asynchronous feedback;grading;video feedback","Computer crashes;Computers;Education;Multimedia communication;Programming;Standards;Streaming media","computer science education;feedback;multimedia computing;programming;software engineering;teaching","asynchronous multimedia feedback;freshman programming course;novice computer programmer;software engineering exercise;student perception;teaching style","","","","20","","","","21-24 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Goal models are useful to deal with problem space modeling and support requirements analysis activities including alternative selection, a procedure that is performed to evaluate the feasibility and desirability of alternative strategies with respect to quality goals. The results of alternative requirements selection can be referred to derive the configuration of solution space models and accordingly the implementation of software, since requirements elements can be traced to architecture elements or architecture design issues. Most of the existing goal-oriented requirement engineering (GORE) frameworks conduct alternative selection based on qualitative goal models, which are too coarse-grained to differentiate alternatives. Several works offer quantitative analysis based on quantified goal models, but they did not provide guided methods to obtain the numbers in these models. In this paper, we extend general goal models by appending quantitative attributes and a modified AHP-based approach to the quantification of goal-related links. Based on this quantitative goal model, an algorithm is proposed to guide the procedure of goal violation detection and multi-criteria alternative selection. We have evaluated the proposed approach by comparing it with six related approaches, with the conclusion that our method makes improvements to support multi-criteria selection of requirements and design alternatives.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0110-1; POD:978-1-5090-0111-8","10.1109/MoDRE.2015.7343877","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7343877","Alternative Selection;Goal Model;Goal Violation Detection;Quantification","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Computer architecture;Requirements engineering;Security;Software;Statistical analysis","analytic hierarchy process;software architecture","GORE frameworks;MDE;architecture design issues;architecture elements;goal model driven alternative selection;goal violation detection;goal-oriented requirement engineering frameworks;goal-related link quantification;model driven engineering;modified AHP-based approach;multicriteria alternative selection;multicriteria selection;problem space modeling;quantitative approach;quantitative attributes;requirements analysis activities;requirements element tracing","","","","23","","","","24-24 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the existing methods for predicting the hidden behavior, a lot of testing data (usually quantitative information) are needed to be sampled. However, some complex engineering systems have the following characteristics: 1) The systems cannot be tested periodically, and the observable information is incomplete; 2) the change process of hidden behavior may be affected by the test; and 3) only part of quantitative information and qualitative knowledge (i.e., semiquantitative information) may be obtained. These characteristics all related to the test are named as testing influence for simplicity. Although a model and a corresponding optimal algorithm for training the model parameters have been proposed to predict the hidden behavior on the basis of semiquantitative information and belief rule base (BRB), the testing influence has not been considered. In order to solve the above problems, a new BRB-based model, which can use the semiquantitative information, is proposed under testing influence in this paper. In the newly proposed forecasting model, there are some parameters of which the initial values are usually assigned by experts and may not be accurate, which can lead to the inaccurate prediction results. As such, an improved optimal algorithm for training the parameters of the forecasting model is further developed on the basis of the expectation-maximization idea and the covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy (CMA-ES). By using the semiquantitative information, the proposed BRB-based model and the improved CMA-ES algorithm can operate together in an integrated manner so as to improve the forecasting precision. A case study is examined to demonstrate the ability and applicability of the newly proposed BRB-based forecasting model and the improved CMA-ES algorithm.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2015.2426207","Foundation of Department of Education of Jilin Province of China; Joint Laboratory of Flight Vehicle Ocean-based Measurement and Control; NSFC; National Science Foundation of China (NSFC); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7094292","Belief rule base;Covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy;Hidden behavior;Prediction;Semi-quantitative information;Testing influence;covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy;hidden behavior;prediction;semiquantitative information;testing influence","Forecasting;Hidden Markov models;Linear programming;Mathematical model;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Testing","belief networks;covariance matrices;evolutionary computation;expectation-maximisation algorithm;forecasting theory;knowledge based systems;large-scale systems;prediction theory","BRB-based forecasting model;CMA-ES;belief rule base;complex system;covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy;expectation-maximization method;hidden behavior prediction;model parameter;optimal algorithm;parameter training;qualitative knowledge;semiquantitative information;testing influence","","5","","44","","","20150424","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To motivate the students' interest had provided good results to engage students in the contents of our course. In particular, we suggest them to build their own complete embedded system, which structure and purpose is completely decided by the students. This freedom makes the students be stimulated, interested and enjoy, moving them to find the solutions they require in learning material. In this way, students feel that knowledge to acquire in the course is useful instead of just something boring to learn for an exam, but at the same time the use of that material allows them to internalize it and get new skills. But also, once the project finish makes students feel self-confident to face engineering challenges that they may find in future work. During the last years, the students achieved design and debugging skills on VHDL by facing the challenges from their own proposed system. Commonly, students go deeper in the areas when they feel interested than when teachers request them. It is because students find the relevance of the knowledge when it provide solutions to them. Also, this motivation moves students to spend more hours in the project than they use to spend in other subjects. In fact, students even decide to buy FPGA training boards to keep working at home (prices start from 36$).

Several protocols are proposed to eliminate this binding. Most of these protocols use IPv6-based host identifiers to maintain compatibility with existing Internet, but these identifiers cannot be handled by standard IPv6 routers because such identifiers are unroutable. Therefore, host identifiers need to be usually converted to locators at hosts, and the standard IPv6 protocol should be modified to interoperate with these protocols. In this paper, we propose a network-based host identifier locator separating scheme in software-defined network. The proposed scheme separates the underlying network into Host Identity and IP domains in order to directly forward unroutable identifiers. Host Identity domain includes its own routing strategy based on a distributed hash table algorithm. The proposed scheme directly handles the packets which have host identifiers as its addresses, and converts the host identifiers to the corresponding locators in the network.

To meet this challenge, a new medical image protection scheme using hyperchaos-based encryption is suggested in this paper. Improvements have been made to both permutation and diffusion methods to address the security problems encountered by many existing chaos-based image ciphers. In the permutation stage, a pixel swapping-based strategy is introduced instead of using the area-preserving chaotic maps, and the swapping operation is determined by the first two state variables of the employed 4-D hyperchaotic system. During the diffusion procedure, the key stream elements, quantified from the other two state variables, are circularly shifted according to the plain-pixels. Consequently, the keystream is related to both the key and the plain-image, which ensures the security against known/ chosen-plaintext attack. Thorough experimental tests are carried out and the results indicate that the proposed scheme provides an effective way for online secure medical image transmission over public networks.","2326-828X;2326828X","Electronic:978-1-4799-8072-7; POD:978-1-4799-8073-4","10.1109/ISMICT.2015.7107507","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7107507","hyperchaotic system;medical image protection;permutation-diffusion;pseudorandom number sequence","Biomedical imaging;Chaotic communication;Ciphers;Encryption","chaos;cryptography;medical image processing;telecommunication security;telemedicine;visual communication","area-preserving chaotic maps;chaos-based image ciphers;chosen-plaintext attack;hyperchaos-based encryption;medical image protection scheme;pixel swapping-based strategy;security problems;teleradiology services","","2","","10","","","","24-26 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is especially important in learning environments where the user needs to focus on subject material rather than on the device used to record or store the subject information. Using Tablet PCs and slate devices, instructors are able to increase their effectiveness by making more dynamic presentations and by incorporating active exercises into their classroom environments. Tablet PCs also enable better and more natural note-taking by students and easier after-class review of course material and notes. Further, Tablet PCs facilitate better interaction with persons participating in classroom sessions from remote locations since they easily involve students exchanging visual descriptions of concepts with the instructor and the rest of the class. Several software packages are available to support the pedagogical needs of the university classroom as well as typical group collaborative environments. Classroom Presenter, DyKnow, WriteOn, LectureTools, and MS OneNote with the Interactive Classroom and Math Add in are examples of some of the packages that provide excellent classroom capabilities. These packages allow for a highly interactive environment with both teacher-student and student-student bi-direction real-time interaction. See www.ee.vt.edu/~igtront/tabletpc/ to download tablet PC software. Electronic textbook frameworks like VText are being developed to allow students to have an electronic textbook on their tablet or slate devices. This workshop will also explore the use of these frameworks and how they may be used to enhance student learning practices. In this hands-on tutorial faculty will receive an introduction to the use of Classroom Presenter, OneNote, Interactive Classroom, VText, VectorPad, LectureTools, and PDF Annotator. We will provide sufficient instruction for faculty to have a basic comp- tency with the technology. Most importantly, we will show faculty various pedagogical practices that we have found helpful in using these technology tools in the classroom over the past seven years. Active learning exercises for various disciplines will be emphasized. Faculty will be tasked with developing short active learning exercises starting from the development of goals for the exercise, through the desired student interaction, and ending with the exercise assessment and improvement strategy. These active learning exercises will be targeted to students who are expected to be in the classroom as well as those who may be taking the course at extended campus locations.

One of the strategies is to implement the asynchronous type of interaction. An online activity in blended learning using e-learning models is known as a Learning Management System (LMS). Currently LMS has been widely applied in the educational process in higher education institutions. To assess the results of the application of the LMS, we need a quality model that can be referenced by developers of LMS. This study developed a model for the application of quality in an asynchronous blended learning system The model allows an LMS can be evaluated by a party who is not an expert in the field of software technology, especially for the users, who is usually not involved in the system development phase directly. This model is expected to be a reference for both by the developers and users. In this study, the quality of the application the model is applied based on ISO/IEC 9126. This model supports the evaluation of two primary requirements, the needs of virtual communication and the delivery of educational activities, which has seven features, namely: discussion boards, e-mail, blogs, lectures, assignments, quizzes and grades. The quality characteristics in this model, among others are the suitability of implementation, ease of procedures, flexibility (interaction, tests and learner control), user security permissions, as well as response time, availability, reliability and completeness of the system. So the quality factor is proposed functionality (suitability, accurattime behavioreness, security), reliability (maturity), usability (learnability) and efficiency (time behavior). The proposed model was validated with a case study of LMS in the Politeknik Caltex Riau (LMS PCR). The results have shown that the model could offer a quality evaluation of LMS PCR. The model has been able to demonstrate that the LMS PCR was conformed to the re- uirements of an asynchronous blended learning system.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-8477-0; Electronic:978-1-4799-8478-7; POD:978-1-4799-8479-4","10.1109/ICEECS.2014.7045251","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045251","ISO/IEC 9126;asynchronous;blended learning;learning management system","Electronic learning;IEC standards;ISO standards;Least squares approximations;Q-factor;Security;Time factors","computer aided instruction;educational institutions;further education","ISO/IEC 9126;LMS;LMS PCR;LMS in the Politeknik Caltex Riau;application model;asynchronous blended learning system;e-learning models;educational activities;educational process;higher education institutions;learning management system quality;online activity;quality model;software technology;virtual communication","","0","","37","","","","24-25 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As for the former course, we intend to determine the added value of collaborative teaching, aiming at equipping the participants with both technical and non-technical skills required for their prospective jobs. The primary goal is, therefore, to allow students to manage a relatively large number of tools with little prior knowledge and having to work out how to obtain detailed information about given features when required.

There are specific tools focused on supporting self-regulation learning processes, but not each of them fulfill this task in the same manner. Additionally, there are generic tools that offer a good level of support for some of these processes. We believe that it is possible to offer good support for the self-regulation of learning through the use of software tools, but it is important to select them and evaluate the level of support that they can offer. In this respect, we studied self-regulated learning theory trying to understand the mechanisms of self-regulation and define the criteria for designing software tools with proper support for these self-regulated learning processes. On this basis we created a questionnaire for the evaluation of self-regulated learning support that allows to evaluate software tools in this respect, enable its selection and also provide useful information for software developers so they can improve their tools to offer better support.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4428-6; POD:978-1-4799-4427-9","10.1109/SIIE.2014.7017717","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7017717","Learning Strategy;Questionnaire;Self-regulated Learning;Software Tool Evaluation","Cognition;Context;Least squares approximations;Monitoring;Planning;Software tools","computer aided instruction","learning strategy;self-regulated learning support;self-regulated learning theory;self-regulation strategy;software tools;student knowledge","","0","","13","","","","12-14 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Step by step on designing the software is build first to make the work on calculation easy and simple by using finite element method. Numbers of configurations are possible with various design variables such as outer diameter, pitch, and length of the tubes; tube passes; baffle spacing; baffle cut etc. Hence the engineer needs an efficient strategy in searching for the global minimum. Here the shell and tube line utilizes bare tube (straight and u-tubes), helical low-fin outside, longitudinal fins (inside & outside are available). These exchangers are suitable for a variety of applications and are offered in fixed tube sheets or removable bundles. A finite element model to predict temperature distribution in heat exchanger is reported. The predictions are in good agreement with available analytical solutions. The model can be effectively used to analyze and design heat exchangers with complex flow arrangements for which no regular design procedure is available.

Health-related equipment can be defined as electronic devices that are able to be implanted in the patient's body to help his health state. Insulin pump and pacemaker device are some instances of such equipment. Most of the patients who use these devices do not have much technical knowledge. Therefore, these devices must be self-configuring and self-managing. More significantly, they should be able to tolerate and remove errors. As these equipment are often sensitive and may affect the life of human beings, their software are called vital software programs. Even a small error in these vital software programs may endanger lives of human being. The runtime test of these software programs is necessary. This article aims at presenting a solution to verify the performance of these devices. Pacemaker device as a sample is studied. The proposed strategy suggests the application of reactive model-based software agents which play the role of an oracle in a software test. This agent's knowledgebase is obtained by Petri net drawn based on the proper state of device implementation. Petri net first turns into matrix thanks to linear algebra and then changes to rules which the agent uses to make decisions. Using its intelligence, the agent directs the error, if identified, to the safe mode. The safe mode is meant to be the patient's proper heart rate. Checking at runtime by use of the agent in addition to the assurance of accurate performance of device can make quick decision makings at crisis time possible for those devices related to human health.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5487-2; POD:978-1-4799-5488-9","10.1109/ICCKE.2014.6993410","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6993410","Health system;Petri-net;Software Testing;agent","Heart rate;Insulin;Pacemakers;Petri nets;Sensors;Software;Testing","Petri nets;matrix algebra;medical information systems;program testing;software agents","HIS;Petri nets;e-health;electronic health;health information systems;health-related equipment;insulin pump;linear algebra;matrix algebra;medical software runtime checking;pacemaker device;reactive model-based software agents;software test;vital software programs","","1","","18","","","","29-30 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The basic hypothesis is that technology does not need to be complex or state-of-the-art to be helpful. Basic knowledge of mechanics, electronics and computation is enough to solve a need and provide simple yet useful, products. The case herein presented is about a classroom of students who are currently working on social-technological projects. They are collaborating with Multiple Attention Center (CAM), which serves children with all types of special needs, such as motility problems, cerebral palsy, language problems, blindness or deafness. The goal is simple: provide a solution for one person at the CAM.The students, organized in teams, were offered +10% on their final grade for the design and manufacture of a product that helps one person at the CAM. As a result of this offer, 10 different products were developed, such as a special mouse with a large joystick and a software interface to communicate basic needs, developed for children affected with cerebral palsy, and a blow-training device for children with language problems. It is important to recall that each project is customized and unique for a person at the CAM, which becomes attractive for students involvement, but not for commercial purposes.Teachers at the CAM have been involved with the requirements definition for the products and will provide their evaluation. These projects also fulfill three relevant objectives for the engineering students: To use knowledge to implement a real-life solution, to make them aware that they can change a life with a little bit of technology, and to bring them face to face with different realities other than the one at their private university. This strategy can be easily employed to reach more people with little monetary investment and significant satisfaction.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7193-0; POD:978-1-4799-7194-7","10.1109/GHTC.2014.6970297","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6970297","","Computer aided manufacturing;Educational institutions;Engineering students;Face;Investment;Proposals;Software","computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;handicapped aids;product design","blow-training device;cerebral palsy;children-with-special needs;classroom strategy;engineering students;language problems;multiple attention center;product design;social-technological projects;software interface;university","","0","","14","","","","10-13 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The patches used for dictionary learning are efficiently sampled from the low-resolution input image itself using our proposed sample mean square error strategy, without an external training set containing a large collection of high- resolution images. Moreover, the l<sup>0</sup>-optimization-based criterion, which is much faster than l<sup>1</sup>-optimization-based relaxation, is applied to both the dictionary learning and reconstruction phases. Compared with other super-resolution reconstruction methods, our low- dimensional dictionary is a more compact representation of patch pairs and it is capable of learning global and local information jointly, thereby reducing the computational cost substantially. Our algorithm can generate high-resolution images that have similar quality to other methods but with an increase in the computational efficiency greater than hundredfold.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2014.2364976","10.13039/501100001809 - Liaoning Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - Ph.D. Start-up Foundation of Liaoning Province China; 10.13039/501100001809 - Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6936374","Approximate K-singular value decomposition;sample mean square error;self-example;single image super-resolution;sparse representation","Approximation algorithms;Dictionaries;Image reconstruction;Image resolution;Interpolation;Reconstruction algorithms;Training","image matching;image reconstruction;image representation;image resolution;mean square error methods;singular value decomposition","K-singular value decomposition algorithm;SVD algorithm;approximation;dictionary learning;high-resolution image generation;l<sup>0</sup>-optimization-based criterion;orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm;reconstruction phases;sample mean square error strategy;self-example-learning-based sparse reconstruction;single image super-resolution;sparse representation","","23","","37","","","20141024","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The goal of the recommendation strategy is to provide support for personalized access to the resources that exist in open educational repositories. The strategy uses: 1) a description of the resources based on metadata standards enriched by ontology-based semantic indexing, and 2) contextual information about the user (her knowledge of that particular field of learning).

The strategy is based on the main principles of blended learning and the analysis of the results of experiments with students from different faculties. Various tests were carried out to identify students' levels of knowledge and preferences in their learning process based on their learning styles. Throughout the experiment, students were divided into groups according to the test outcomes. Separate groups were formed of students with different levels of knowledge and learning styles, determined using the Felder-Silverman model. Adaptive learning tools were provided for the students considering the three main aspects: students' background, the level of their prior knowledge and their preferred learning style. The success of the strategy presented in this article is demonstrated by comparing the achievements of the test group with the reference group, who were not taught using the new strategies.","","Electronic:978-83-60810-58-3; POD:978-1-4799-2853-8; USB:978-8-3608-1057-6","10.15439/2014F259","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6933102","","Computer science;Educational institutions;Equations;Informatics;Materials;Mathematical model;Standards","computer science education;information science education","Felder-Silverman model;Tallinn University of Technology;adaptive learning tools;blended learning;individualization;informatics course","","2","","11","","","","7-10 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Control strategy to alleviate PV power output fluctuations through a superconducting coil","S. P. Dimakis; G. K. Papagiannis; G. C. Christoforidis","School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece","2014 49th International Universities Power Engineering Conference (UPEC)","20141023","2014","","","1","6","During the last decade, the significant incentives that many countries provided worldwide led to a rapid increase in the deployment of renewable energy sources and especially of photovoltaics (PV). However, PV power output is highly volatile and may drastically change the power output within a few seconds. Therefore, voltage and frequency stability in an electric power system is brought under compromise. Power conditioning, using efficient and highly responsive means of energy storage, such as Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES), may be the solution to that problem. Although this technology is still not competitive in market terms, its main advantage being the fastest response of all energy storage options has led many researchers to investigate the technical aspects of SMES utilization. This paper investigates the use of a Current Source Converter (CSC)-based SMES system in the power conditioning of a PV power plant output. The charging and discharging of a superconducting coil is controlled in order to compensate for power fluctuations from the PV plant, caused by unexpected phenomena such as cloud shading. A parallel active filter topology is utilized and a control strategy based on the instantaneous ABC power theory is proposed to separate the power fluctuations from a constant power reference. The corresponding currents are then used as reference inputs to a space vector modulation, where the switching patterns for the CSC are produced. Finally, simulations are carried out using the PSIM software. The system capability to control and stabilize the power delivered to the grid for several seconds is investigated.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-6556-4; Electronic:978-1-4799-6557-1; POD:978-1-4799-6558-8","10.1109/UPEC.2014.6934705","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6934705","Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage;current source converter;instantaneous ABC theory;photovoltaic plants;power conditioning","Energy storage;Modulation;Power generation;Superconducting coils;Topology;Vectors","active filters;fluctuations;frequency stability;network topology;photovoltaic power systems;power grids;power markets;power system control;power system stability;superconducting coils;superconducting magnet energy storage;switching convertors","CSC-based SMES system;PSIM software;PV power output fluctuation control strategy;PV power plant;constant power reference;current source converter based SMES system;frequency stability;instantaneous ABC power theory;parallel active filter topology;photovoltaic power plant;power conditioning;power grid;power market;power stability;renewable energy source;space vector modulation;superconducting coil charging;superconducting coil discharging;superconducting magnetic energy storage;switching pattern;voltage stability","","0","","11","","","","2-5 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The dominant curriculum models for software engineers has focused on the solution space's declarative knowledge and has mostly relegated problem solving skills to that of a consequence of the primary educational process. In this paper we present a constructivist aware strategy to amend software engineering curricula by integrating problem solving skill development. To build this approach we examined mathematician Gyorgy Polya's heuristic of a generalized problem solving model in the context of software engineering (SE) and propose the necessary augmentation to support skill development. We take the position that Polya's approach may not only functionally address well defined problems encountered at an introductory level but is expandable to tackle ill-structured or wicked problems inherent in the design of complex systems. We present a controlled classroom study which investigates the utility of the proposed methodology to address a set of welldefined problems in a small representative student sampling.

We focus on several features of SaaS competition, including differences in vendor offerings, incomplete information on application functionality, the potential lock-in risk of SaaS clients, and their cost of learning about what it will take to make the vendors' software work well. Clients can sample the fit costs of adoption, but can switch to another vendor. We obtained several findings through the use of a game-theoretic model. First, a client's switching cost is important for its decision-making regarding SaaS adoption. With a relatively high switching cost, a more cost-efficient vendor of IT services will be able to drive the less cost-efficient competitor out of its market. Second, the impact of the client's switching cost on vendors works differently. An increase in switching cost enables one vendor to charge a higher price and achieve higher profit, while the other will be forced to charge a lower price and hardly make a profit. Third, what matters is not how much a vendor can enhance service quality, but instead how costly it will be to improve quality enough to attract sufficient customer interest to achieve profitability.","0018-9391;00189391","","10.1109/TEM.2014.2332633","Lee Kuan Yew Faculty Fellowship for Research Excellence at Singapore Management University; Singapore's Ministry of Education Tier 1 Research Support Program; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6857369","Adverse and beneficial lock-in;cost efficiency;economic analysis;quality;services sampling;software-as-a-service (SaaS);strategy;switching costs;vendor competition","Costs;Economics;Software as a service;Subscriptions","DP industry;cloud computing;decision making;game theory;pricing;profitability","IT services;SaaS clients;SaaS competition;application functionality;client switching cost;decision-making;game-theoretic model;lock-in risk;pricing strategy;profitability;quality strategy;software-as-a-service vendors;vendor software work","","3","","50","","","20140716","Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In parallel, other studies indicate that the emergence of agile methods in the 90s led to the formation of high performance teams with great level of knowledge in technical, business and behavioral domains.

For this purpose, this article presents a modular approach for teaching module regarding three-phase thyristor rectifiers. A simulator based on the MATLAB equation solver has been developed by considering the detailed physical operation of such converters. In particular, the realized simulator takes various aspects into account, including continuous and discontinuous, commutation, its effect on the supply network and control parameters variations. The software modularity considers a very simple starting point and allows the extension to more complex topologies (bidirectional converters, cycloconverters and so on), maintaining always the same level of interaction with the students so that they can increase their skills and develop their own self-learning capability and self-training strategies.","","CD:978-1-4799-3786-8; Electronic:978-1-4799-3787-5","10.1109/EVER.2014.6844096","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844096","Equation oriented simulation software;Modular teaching approach;Power electronics;converters","Equations;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Rectifiers","commutation;educational courses;mathematics computing;power electronics;rectifying circuits;teaching;thyristor convertors;training;unsupervised learning","Matlab equation solver;bidirectional converters;complex topology;continuous commutation;control parameters variations;cycloconverters;discontinuous commutation;equation-oriented softwares;modern education system;modular approach;passive learning;physical operation;self-learning capability;self-training strategy;supply network;teaching module;teaching power electronics;teaching thyristor rectifiers;three-phase thyristor rectifiers;university courses","","0","","30","","","","25-27 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We worked with a similar strategy to overcome failures caused by unidirectional SEUs occurring simultaneously in both frontline and redundant modules, but the approach we propose in this paper not only improves reliability but also requires low-overhead as compared to previous methodologies. The proposed architecture is an array of computation tiles containing computation cells and corresponding hot-spares. Each computation tile has a separate region for spare cells. The simultaneous faults are handled by an on-chip fault-tolerant core and external host software that partially reconfigure the spare-cells region of a computation tile. The proposed architecture is implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA device and verified with the aid of simple digital application.

Understanding program behavior is one of the most important factors in learning programming and in maintenance of existing programs. Here, the need exists to develop tools to facilitate understanding and to serve more than documentation and initial planning needs of a program (i.e., pseudo codes and flowcharts). In order to understand a program's behavior, a programmer needs a computer model that will execute it. Visualization has proven effective as a strategy for providing programmers and students with clearer meaning of their codes, developing and maintaining programs, and learning programming. This paper proposes a new diagrammatic methodology that produces a conceptual representation of program instructions. It can provide a foundation for understanding the behavior of running programs. The paper also reports on applying the new method to teaching an introductory university course, the results demonstrate that it improves understanding of programming and its underlying computer operations.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3188-0; POD:978-1-4799-3189-7","10.1109/ITNG.2014.74","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6822224","Visualization;conceptual representation;program visualization;programming language","Computers;Data visualization;Frequency modulation;Hardware;Programming profession;Software","computer science education;data visualisation;knowledge acquisition;software maintenance","complex process;execution visualization;knowledge acquisition;program instructions;programming knowledge development;programming statement;programs. maintenance;university course","","1","","27","","","","7-9 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a multimedia sports courseware in teaching movement skills, which will be developed based on the Simpson's Psychomotor Domain Taxonomy. Integrated with a video analysis technology and simulation, the courseware would be developed for all sport subjects in the sports science syllabus. This paper highlights the analysis phase of the study, which investigated students' problems in learning movement skills. In particular, the problems were divided into four types of construct (teaching strategy, learning materials, individual differences, external and internal factors). This paper also seeks to identify the dominant construct that might optimize the learning outcomes. Overall, 83 undergraduate students? majoring in sports science in one Malaysian university? were involved. The instruments used were questionnaire supported by some interviews. Quantitative data were analyzed using the SPSS 16 while qualitative data were analyzed through content analysis. The results from this initial study will be used to develop the courseware and facilitate the discussion on how it will be adopted in the process of preparing materials for the learning of movement skills. Additionally, this courseware could also promote students to a more advanced learning process that can trigger positive effects in their movement skills learning.

The analysis of various methods of stack protection has given us an estimate of the additional memory required for the implementation of specific techniques. The size of the additional memory depends on many factors including computer architecture, OS environment, programming languages used to create the program. For the protection methods considered in the paper, the cost may vary from the insignificant amount for prevention purposes, based on the careful analysis of input data in the program, to the use of Guard Pages when extra memory may include additional pages of the memory. In many cases developers have to use various mitigation strategies in order to make programs less vulnerable to buffer overflows. The main contribution of this paper is the analysis and evaluation of the additional memory required for the various methods of protection from buffer overflow. The current paper allows readers to understand the cost of these methods more clearly, which, in turn, will result in more efficient and secure programs.

On one hand, they inadequately prepare engineering students to engage in collaborative partnerships (essential for the practicing engineer) and, on the other hand, they promote passive learning and contribute to a compartmentalized curriculum. These strategies may not prepare students for the innovative and flexible role of engineers in today's society. Using non-traditional learning strategies is essential to prepare engineers ready to succeed in their professional life. To contribute to enhancing the problem solving skills and higher order thinking of the graduates in Civil Engineering program of University of Aveiro, Portugal, two complementary courses on Geotechnical subjects have been redesigned using non-traditional learning models: Soil Mechanics I and II. The non-traditional strategies include cooperative and collaborative learning models using team projects or problems. These models have been implemented since 2007/2008. The nontraditional learning strategies used are described and discussed, pointing out how they can contribute to the development of problem solving and high order thinking skills. The students' reactions to these models are addressed and the strategies implemented to promote their acceptance are presented. To assess the impact of the models implemented three different and complementary strategies were used: students' feedback during the semester; monitoring of marks; questionnaires at the end of the semester. The evolution of the students' response to these models is discussed using data collected in the courses.

A couple of software tools, namely Cedrat Flux and Portunus, are employed suitably interfaced each other. The first one allows the computation of the motor electromagnetic behavior using a finite element model, while the second one allows the dynamic simulation of the control and feeding converter. The interacting use of these tools allows a detailed prediction of the motor transient behavior under a given control strategy and drive scheme. As test case a permanent magnet synchronous motor for biomedical application is considered, driven by field-oriented control. The co-simulation approach is at first compared with the (usual) lumped parameter modeling simulation and then verified by experiments. The results demonstrate that the co-simulation procedure allows taking into account not negligible phenomena, such as cogging and torque ripple, usually not considered in similar studies. Hence, co-simulation analysis represents a significant step for the integrate design of the motor and control, as well as a meaningful tool for electrical drives education.","1553-572X;1553572X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0224-8; POD:978-1-4799-0225-5; USB:978-1-4799-0223-1","10.1109/IECON.2013.6700264","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6700264","AC motors;PI control;brushless motors;circuit simulation;finite element methods;permanent magnet motors;power systems simulation","Analytical models;Brushless motors;Computational modeling;Finite element analysis;Permanent magnet motors;Synchronous motors;Torque","biomedical equipment;computational electromagnetics;control engineering computing;finite element analysis;machine vector control;permanent magnet motors;power system simulation;software tools;synchronous motor drives;transient analysis","Cedrat Flux;PM synchronous motor drives;Portunus;biomedical application;control strategy;dynamic simulation;electric motor drives;electrical drives education;embedded finite element motor modeling;feeding converter;field oriented control;finite element model cosimulation;motor electromagnetic behavior computation;motor transient behavior prediction;permanent magnet synchronous motor;software tools;transient analysis;transient simulation tools","","3","","12","","","","10-13 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to do this, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, and Native American undergraduate engineering students of various disciplines were interviewed using theoretically grounded qualitative methods. The transcripts were coded for patterns using NVivo qualitative analysis software and the patterns found are described in detail within this paper. These patterns gave us insight into the factors that contribute to minority students' success and therefore lead to recommendations on ways for college campuses to encourage and foster their minority students' success. The insights reported in this paper will hopefully help universities make changes that will greatly improve the success of their minority students in engineering majors.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4673-5261-1; POD:978-1-4673-5259-8; USB:978-1-4673-5260-4","10.1109/FIE.2013.6684887","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6684887","diversity;minority students;narrative;retention","Educational institutions;Engineering students;Interviews;Knowledge engineering;Organizations;Scholarships;Social network services","data analysis;educational administrative data processing;educational institutions;engineering computing;engineering education;further education","African American undergraduate engineering students;Asian American undergraduate engineering students;Hispanic American undergraduate engineering students;NVivo qualitative analysis software;Native American undergraduate engineering students;college campuses;educational universities;engineering majors;engineering programs;minority student informed retention strategies;minority student retention improvement;minority student success;science-technology-engineering-and-mathematics community;theoretically grounded qualitative methods","","0","","12","","","","23-26 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Modeling software the alloy way","M. J. Lutz","Software Eng.

First, most modeling tools used seemingly esoteric notations that were hurdles for many students. Even if the notation could be tamed, the tools themselves were rarely more than syntax checkers, possibly with support for simple expression evaluation. Venturing beyond this requires understanding of proof theories and strategies well beyond that typical of other engineering disciplines. What is more, the tools worked at a much lower level than that of the domain itself; it was easy for students to miss the forest for the trees. The development and release of the Alloy from MIT has improved the situation dramatically. With Alloy, instructors now have a tool that supports formal structural and behavioral modeling (using C-like syntax), along with state space exploration and property verification using relational logic, predicates, and assertions The tradeoff involved - only first order systems over finite domains can be analyzed - is not problematic in practice. The workshop will introduce Alloy - both the language and support tool - to faculty interested in formal methods and mathematical modeling. After a brief introduction to Alloy concepts, the tool and language will be explored by interactively developing a simple software system model. This approach mirrors the way Alloy is taught and used within RIT's undergraduate software engineering program.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4673-5261-1; POD:978-1-4673-5259-8; USB:978-1-4673-5260-4","10.1109/FIE.2013.6684771","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6684771","formal methods;mathematical modeling;software engineering education","Computational modeling;Conferences;Mathematical model;Metals;Software;Software engineering;Space exploration","computer science education;formal logic;formal verification","Alloy;C-like syntax;behavioral modeling;esoteric notation;formal structural modeling;property verification;relational logic;state space exploration;syntax checker;undergraduate software engineering program","","0","","4","","","","23-26 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Communication Patterns serve both as an approach for rigorous qualitative analysis and as a library of established practices that students can draw from. The approach has clear links to software design patterns and highlights the fact that communication, like software, is a designed artifact. We focus on two software projects from our case study repository, using Communication Patterns. The two case studies have a great deal of overlap in objectives, stakeholders, responsibilities and timescales, but the outcomes are drastically different. Through patterns, we assess communication at strategic and tactical levels, and we find major differences in communication choices.

There are modern approaches that may make the education process easier and more appealing. A remarkably promising example of this is the use of computer games in the teaching and learning process. We suggest a methodology of two-fold use of learning games for teaching software engineers. Students, experienced in programming, develop learning games, and then we use the games that are developed for teaching the next generation of students. After gaining skills in basic subjects these students are involved in the development of new learning games. Teachers in our department play the role of customer, as they are interested in getting new effective tools for teaching and are ready to participate in our work. Students developing games learn all the software development life cycle phases including testing, deployment and maintenance, they contact real customers (teachers of corresponding subjects) and real users (students, learning these subjects). Student teams have developed several games that are used for teaching new students. Students, who participated in game development, gained such important professional skills as software design, testing, debugging and development, working with open source libraries, version controls systems, other modern tools and domain-specific programming languages. Students were also trained in soft skills such as team working, project management, and conflict resolution. Teachers, using games as learning systems, notice an improvement in students' motivation in learning and their will to be involved into the learning process. Our experience of using computer games shows that this approach is very effective for improving students' skills and motivation to study.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5064-0; POD:978-1-4799-0853-0","10.1109/ECBS-EERC.2013.22","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6664517","computer learning games;software development;teaching/learning strategies","Computer languages;Educational institutions;Games;Programming profession;Software","computer aided instruction;computer games;computer science education;program debugging;program testing;software engineering","computer game;conflict resolution;debugging;domain-specific programming language;education process;game-based learning cycle;learning process;open source libraries;project management;software design;software development life cycle;software engineering;software testing;teaching;team working;version control system","","1","","28","","","","29-30 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is authentic, rigorous, and enjoyable, making it an excellent topic for an undergraduate software engineering course. However, it is difficult to explain to the beginner how to generate a successful exploratory strategy. “Case studies” and “lessons learned” from practitioners illustrate the value of exploratory testing but do not necessarily reveal the motivation for a particular exploratory tour. Here we discuss the use of problem frames as a means of guiding students toward promising testing strategies. Problem frames were originally proposed as a requirements analysis approach, carefully locating and bounding software problems to be solved, then matching subproblems to commonly occurring problem patterns or “frames”. A natural extension to that idea is to associate test strategies with particular frame concerns, guiding the student toward exploratory techniques that are well-suited to the frame.

The scaffolding is tailored to the student's needs, with various levels of support. The increasing demand for scaffolding, and its constant evolution, means that software aids are needed. The authors adopted a systematic instructional design, with associated software, to create a learning environment that supports the execution of the strategy.

Unfortunately, placing the partitions and the replica of them on randomly nodes maybe easily influenced load balancing of nodes. What's more, it may increase the data access time and cost of updating replication. Therefore, we propose multi-tenant cloud data and replica placement strategy based on the graph, we take network distance and load balancing of nodes into account. We also propose a dynamic scheduling method according to the load state of nodes. We use the Paxos algorithm to further ensure that the SaaS application system availability and consistency.

Crucial to successful mastery is the development of discipline specific cognitive and metacognitive skills, including self-regulation. We can assist our students in the process of reflection and self-regulation by identifying and articulating successful self-regulated learning strategies for specific discipline contexts. However, in order to do so, we must develop an understanding of those discipline specific strategies that can be successful and readily adopted by students, and ways of understanding and articulating successful mental models. In this paper, we explore a Neo-Piagetian analysis of students' reflections upon their software development processes, enabling us to identify mental models for software development. We adopt a case study approach, identifying key examples of pre-operational behaviours that rely upon self-regulated learning strategies in place of articulated mental models, through to formal operational behaviours exhibiting complex, multi-relationship models of software development and design activities. Our study provides support for pedagogy for sharing of mental models and strategies amongst students, and guiding students by explicitly modelling the software development process.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4960-6; POD:978-1-4673-5627-5","10.1109/LaTiCE.2013.23","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6542236","Mental Models;Metacognition;Neo-Piaget;Software Development Processes","Cognition;Cognitive science;Concrete;Context;Encoding;Programming;Software","cognition;computer science education;educational courses;software engineering","ICT student;Neo-Piagetian reasoning form;articulated mental model;cognitive skill;information and communication technology;mental model;mental strategy;metacognitive skill;pedagogy;programming skill;self-regulated learning strategy;software design;software development process construction","","1","","36","","","","21-24 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Yet, imbuing educational software with effective intelligent tutoring functions requires considerable time and effort. We present a highly configurable software framework, “Configurable Argumentation Support Engine” (CASE), designed to reduce effort and development costs considerably when building tutorial agents for graphical argumentation learning systems. CASE detects pedagogically relevant patterns in argument diagrams and provides feedback and hints in response. A wide variety of patterns are supported, including ones sensitive to students' understanding of the domain, problem-solving processes, and collaboration processes. Teachers and researchers can configure the behavior of tutorial agents on three levels: patterns, tutorial actions, and tutorial strategies. The paper discusses design concerns, the architecture, and the configuration mechanisms of CASE. As a proof of concept, four showcases are presented each showing different aspects of CASE and thus demonstrating the flexibility and breadth of applicability of the CASE approach in supporting single user and collaborative scenarios across different argumentation domains.","1939-1382;19391382","","10.1109/TLT.2013.3","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6409347","Analytical models;Collaboration;Collaborative learning tools;Computer aided software engineering;Law;Peer to peer computing;Tutorials;authoring tools;intelligent tutoring systems","Analytical models;Collaboration;Computer aided software engineering;Law;Peer to peer computing;Tutorials","courseware;groupware;intelligent tutoring systems;teaching","CASE;argumentation skill teaching;collaboration process;configurable argumentation support engine;configurable software framework;educational software;ethics;graphical argumentation learning system;intelligent tutoring function;law;problem-solving process;science;student learning;student problem solving","","2","","31","","","20130110","April-June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The research methodology, consisting of automating the analysis of student-created computer programs, administering surveys, and collecting exam results, provided an objective measurement of the benefits of the paradigm for novice programmers, as well as evaluating their perception of its usefulness. The results show that the use of aspect-oriented programming as a supplement to object-oriented programming enhances the productivity of novice program code software engineering students and leads to increased understanding of theoretical concepts.

The organizations that will be most successful over the next decade are those that recognize this simple fact. The advantage provided by data that has been transformed into useful information is undeniable: information derived from measurement data can be used to drive differentiation, optimization, and innovation. The future's biggest data challenge lies in effectively managing acquired data to give context to what is otherwise just a series of numbers across thousands of files. Instrumentation hardware vendors have accelerated data collection rates so quickly and enabled engineers and scientists to break through data rate and resolution-barriers so rapidly that today, data is coming in at a truly blistering pace. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the rate of education on proper data storage, management and post-processing techniques. As a result, many organizations have been forced to devise their own schemes for data storage and management since they've effectively been left to their own accord. As a further consequence, many groups within the same organizational entity have adopted conflicting data strategies; this fractured outcome makes it nearly impossible to yield efficiency gains from data collaboration and knowledge sharing. After a brief introduction to the significance of data in the world today and the challenges that engineers and scientists currently face, this presentation will educate the audience on several technologies and techniques that provide a more modular, scalable approach to data management and yield the following benefits: Acquired data will gain context: descriptive information stored throughout the data acquisition and processing life cycle makes data traceable, trackable, usable, and logical to store. Acquired data will be searchable: data mining makes it easy to locate the data that you need, when you need it. Acquired data will be easier to process: from analysis to reportin- , data management reduces the many roadblocks in data processing, particularly as data sets grow in size.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5836-1; POD:978-1-4673-5835-4","10.1109/FIIW.2011.6476827","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6476827","","Context;Data acquisition;Data mining;Databases;Instruments;Memory;Software","data acquisition;data analysis;knowledge management;organisational aspects;storage management","data acquisition;data collaboration;data collection rates;data management technique;data post-processing technique;data processing life cycle;data storage technique;data strategies;differentiation;innovation;instrumentation hardware vendors;knowledge sharing;large data set analysis;large data set management;measurement data;optimization;organizational entity;resolution-barriers","","1","","","","","","7-8 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents the results of our first two years of studying the programs at Miami University and North Carolina State University to determine the kinds of communication utilized in our courses and how communication is taught and assessed. When looking at student attitudes towards communication our analyses suggest that students do not consider technical (professional) activities such as code reading, writing, and inspections as communication activities, and the same applies to more complex genres such as software testing or design. They also appear to have difficulty relating writing and reading that may take place in the context of the courses to what they might be doing as software engineers and computer scientists once they start working. On the other hand, initial results indicate that our students' communications skills increase steadily throughout their stay in the university.

In order to learn to design them, the student must be presented with complex, open-ended problems for which there may be more than one correct solution. The decision-making strategies students acquired in previous courses are not effective when applied to large, complex problems of distributed systems. Students (novice designers) tend to think linearly and focus only on the problem at hand. They also tend to use trial-and-error strategies and they lack confidence in their design decisions. The purpose of the distributed systems' course is to create a learning approach that helps students to adopt and to apply expert design decision-making strategies. We use a case-based learning approach with classroom assessment techniques and rubrics to identify the critical weaknesses in the approaches that novices typically use when attempting to solve difficult design-oriented problems. The novice-oriented knowledge-based learning and application environment is supported by scaffoldings to incorporate expert strategies. In this paper, we describe the experience and the learning environment that provides the opportunities for professional development. We present and analyze our data comparing the students' outcomes over four terms, the time it takes to develop our students' expertise and how time spent with an expert (instructor) is crucial to an overall development.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4673-1352-0; POD:978-1-4673-1353-7; USB:978-1-4673-1351-3","10.1109/FIE.2012.6462229","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6462229","distributed systems;expertise;formative assessment;problem-based learning;scaffoldings","Assembly;Cats;Cognition;Problem-solving;Prototypes;Software;Unified modeling language","computer science education;distributed processing;educational courses;expert systems;learning (artificial intelligence);software engineering","case-based learning approach;classroom assessment technique;decision making strategy;design decision;design skill promotion;distributed software system design;distributed system course;expert strategy;novice-oriented knowledge-based learning;trial-and-error strategy","","2","","32","","","","3-6 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Additionally, students bring perceptions about their abilities, and have already begun practicing preferred methods of analysis and documentation. Understanding how students with different backgrounds develop problem solving skills in first year engineering programs is of critical importance in order to close achievement gaps between diverse populations. This study examines how students solve engineering problems and identifies variations based on student factors of gender, ethnicity, mathematics preparation and achievement, and prior engineering experience. Solutions for three problems from 27 students were analyzed (n = 68 solutions). Students worked out problems using custom-designed software that digitally records ink strokes and allows researchers to associate codes to the problem solution at any point, even in portions of the problem solution that would not have been available without the use of this technology, such as in erased work. Differences in how students solve problems were assessed based on the prevalence (or absence) of elements and errors in the problem solving process, which were evaluated using task analysis. Results indicated that pre-engineering experience did not have a significant impact on successfully solving problems; however, having completed a calculus course was significantly related to successful problem solving. Future research will expand the study population to a larger sample of first year engineering students across multiple semesters, identifying key strategies that are absent for students with low mathematics preparation, and to investigate relationships between prior academic preparation and indicators of metacognition.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4673-1352-0; POD:978-1-4673-1353-7; USB:978-1-4673-1351-3","10.1109/FIE.2012.6462445","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6462445","academic preparation;first year engineering;problem solving","Calculus;Engineering students;Frequency measurement;Problem-solving;Sociology;Statistics","educational courses;engineering education;mathematics","academic preparation;custom-designed software;digitally records ink strokes;engineering courses;engineering problems;engineering students;ethnicity;gender factors;mathematics courses;mathematics preparation;metacognition;preengineering experience;preengineering programs","","1","","23","","","","3-6 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the latter one, when will the remanufacturer source from the backup supplier is the key issue. In this paper, we will focus on the sourcing time for the remanufacturer of reverse supply chain when a supply disruption occurs. First, the stock-flow diagram with supply disruption of the reverse supply chain is presented by Vensim<sup>®</sup> 5.10. Second, the simulation results of the remanufacturer's profit under different supply disruption periods are shown. Then, by analyzing the simulation results, the strategy for sourcing time can be decided according to the remanufacturer's profit.

Sicilia","International Software Consulting Network GesmbH (ISCN), Austria","2012 Technologies Applied to Electronics Teaching (TAEE)","20120712","2012","","","342","347","ECQA (European Certification and Qualification Association) is the result of a series of EU funded projects from 2005-2012. This included European projects such as EQN (European Quality Network, 2005-2007), EU Certificates Campus (2008-2009) and DEUCERT (Dissemination of EU Certification), the ECQA nowadays acts as an organization that is independent from funding. The members of ECQA are widely spread all over Europe and vary from universities to companies as well as individuals. ECQA is aimed at a demographic problem of education and training in the European Union. For people at 40-50 it is many years ago that they attended the university and required skills nowadays are changing every 2-3 years. This means that their skills get outdated and we experience in Europe a growing unemployment from the age of 45 upwards. Universities in Europe are currently not addressing this problem. EQN developed a so called role based qualification concept where e.g. an existing software engineer (who studied informatics some 15 years ago) can identify job roles to upgrade so that he remains a value for the organization. He might receive additional industry qualification for e.g. a safety architect (additionally learning how to enrich existing software architecture with functional safety aspects). This way the person, would for instance, grow into a safety architect position and a younger person who knows more about new programming techniques gets his old position. EQN then developed certification mechanisms for this role based approach for university and industry educational partnerships. EU Cert Campus collected about 15 job roles, structured the corresponding skills sets and established online services. The online services comprise skills browsing, skills assessment, and online training. So people from industry can attend job role based qualification training from the work place. DEUCERT established ambassadors for this new job role based qualification concept Europe and worldwid- . DEUCERT also helped to create a critical mass of partners. At the moment we do have 26 job professions (ready and in progress) that are certified all over Europe and already outside of the European Union. The concept is meanwhile supported by approx. 60 universities and training bodies in Europe. Human resource managers from leading multinational companies called ECQA “a success story” because so far the universities in Europe do not address the mentioned demographic problem and ECQA has already achieved more than 11000 online trainings and more than 6600 certificates in European industry and at university PhD programs. The processes of the ECQA are mapped onto the ISO 17024 international standard for the certification of persons. The PAC project will integrate further skills sets and certification options into the ECQA platform.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2486-1; POD:978-1-4673-2485-4","10.1109/TAEE.2012.6235462","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6235462","European certification strategy;European exam systems;European leraning portals;European qualification standards","Certification;Educational institutions;Europe;Industries;Qualifications;Standards;Training","ISO standards;certification;computer based training;continuing professional development;educational institutions;job specification;unemployment","DEUCERT;Dissemination of EU Certification;ECQA members;EQN;EU Cert Campus;EU Certificates Campus;EU funded projects;European Certification and Qualification Association;European Quality Network;European Union;European industry;European projects;European universities;ISO 17024 standard;PAC project;educational demographic problem;human resource managers;industry certification;industry educational partnerships;job professions;job role-based qualification training;multinational companies;online services;online training;person certification;skills assessment;skills browsing;skills sets;training demographic problem;unemployment;university PhD programs;work place","","0","","11","","","","13-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A smart grids system was used as a Problem Based Learning (PBL) strategy together with an agile method and best practices within a project developed on three courses: CE-240 Database Systems Project, CE-245 Information Technologies, and CE-229 Software Testing. Students of these courses had to interact, in order to produce a prototype of a smart grids system, simulating a real project development. At the end, a survey among students has proved that the integration of practical exercises has provided higher levels of understanding and problem solving capabilities, improving students' knowledge. The survey also has shown that communication between students from different courses should be improved. The major findings of this paper were that the integration of the three courses was favorable by 83% of the surveyed students, and most students (73%) have considered that their knowledge was improved. Authors recommend the use of practical exercises, courses integration, and PBL to considerably increase the quality of electronic and computer engineering courses.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4654-4; POD:978-1-4673-0798-7","10.1109/ITNG.2012.55","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209173","Agile Method;Information Technology Integration;Problem Based Learning;Smart Grids System;Software Engineering Integration","","computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;power engineering computing;power engineering education;problem solving;smart power grids","Brazilian Aeronautics Institute of Technology;CE-229 Software Testing;CE-240 Database Systems Project;CE-245 Information Technologies;Electronic and Computer Engineering Graduate Program;PBL;agile method;computer engineering courses;courses integration;electronic engineering courses;practical exercises;problem based learning strategy;problem solving capabilities;project development;smart grids system;students knowledge improvement","","3","","17","","","","16-18 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Information technology plays a major role in the future of education, as they break geographical barriers and make educational content widely available. Knowledge collaboration is possible by creating virtual classrooms by interconnecting lecturers to geographically scattered students. Making educational material, such as tutorials and recorded lectures, available worldwide through high-storage infrastructures. Digitalizing and making books available through high-storage infrastructures. But this E-learning system requires huge investment for high-storage infrastructure. Some educational organizations and research institutes cannot afford expensive investments. On the other hand, in most of the organizations, there are large amounts of underutilized computing power and storage existing. Data Grid connects underutilized secondary storage of machines and provides huge secondary storage. It enables resource sharing among the geographically distributed users and resources. Therefore the institutes which do not have sufficient budget can make use of Data Grid efficiently. In this paper we have presented that how Grid computing can be used for inexpensive collaborative E-learning. Data replication increases availability, reliability of data and allows fast access to data. Replication reduces bandwidth consumption and congestion over communication line. Therefore replication is the major issue in Data Grid. Replication strategies determine when and where to create a replica of the data. A good replication strategy should ideally minimize file access time, reduce network congestion and minimize job execution time to improve performance of Data Grid. We strongly believe that the technological revolution that the grid is about to bring will definitely change the way that people dea- with information and, ultimately, knowledge. In this sense, grid computing and e-learning form a perfect match.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0726-1; POD:978-1-4577-0725-4","10.1109/ICTEE.2012.6208636","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208636","Computational grid;Data Replication;Data grid;Grid computing","Bandwidth;Collaboration;Distributed databases;Electronic learning;Grid computing;Reliability","courseware;electronic publishing;grid computing;groupware;information retrieval;knowledge management;reliability;resource allocation;software performance evaluation","bandwidth consumption reduction;communication line congestion reduction;data access;data availability;data grid performance improvement;data reliability;data replication;educational content;educational material;educational organizations;electronic books;file access time minimization;geographically distributed resources;geographically distributed users;geographically scattered students;grid computing;high-storage infrastructures;inexpensive collaborative e-learning;information access;information technology;job execution time minimization;knowledge collaboration;knowledge sharing;network congestion reduction;research institutes;resource sharing;secondary storage;unused resource exploitation;virtual classrooms","","1","","19","","","","3-5 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The evaluation is challenging in most cases but especially when educational games are used. In educational games if in-game evaluation exist it is usually based on a series of simple goals and whether these goals are achieved (i.e. assessment). But we consider that evaluation can be improved by taking advantage of in-game interaction, such as the user behavior during the game and the type and number of interactions performed by the user while playing. In this paper, we propose an evaluation framework for educational games based on in-game interaction data. We discuss how user interaction data is collected in the most automatic and seamless way possible, how to analyze the data to extract relevant information, and how to present this information in a usable way to educators so they achieve the maximum benefit from the experience. The evaluation framework is implemented as part of the eAdventure educational platform, where it can be used both to improve upon traditional basic assessment methods (i.e. goals, scores & reports) and to provide information to help improve interaction with games (e.g. discovery strategies).","2165-9559;21659559","Electronic:978-1-4673-1456-5; POD:978-1-4673-1457-2; USB:978-1-4673-1455-8","10.1109/EDUCON.2012.6201154","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6201154","Educational video games;Learning Analytics;case study;framework proposal","Adaptation models;Data models;Engines;Games;Graphical user interfaces;Least squares approximation;Semantics","computer aided instruction;computer games;data analysis","data analysis;eadventure educational platform;educational games;evaluation process;in-game interaction;user behavior;user interaction data","","14","","15","","","","17-20 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specific concerns of implementing electronic governance in a developing country like Bangladesh where there exists extreme shortage of resources, limitations in financing, absence of proper development planning, lack of skilled human resources, unavailability of stable and fair democracy and more importantly, a number of unavoidable circumstances including natural disasters. We especially present the adaptability of e-governance in the prime sectors of government and provide a methodical study on the strategies of involving mass people in the governance process improving information and service delivery with their participation in overall decision-making. The potential to ensure highest level of services in all the sectors of government with the implementation of e-governance is also presented in this paper. Moreover, we provide specific recommendations for implementing e-governance in the most feasible, cost-effective, and efficient manner. Analyzing the conducted survey result through statistical procedures also derives a couple of significant factors in implementing e-governance.

The research question addressed is: “What are the characteristics of successful novel teaching and learning experiences for middle school students that use engineering-based project challenges?” The characteristics of the program were: multiple hands-on learning experiences so students discovered for themselves the means to solve the posed project challenge; deliberate use of the engineering-design process in meeting each project challenge; use of learning cycle (engage, explore, explain, expand, evaluate) method for instructional planning; cognitive apprenticeships for learners with professional engineers and undergraduate engineering students; access to high quality technologies and tools necessary to meet the project challenge; the use of questioning strategies and learning facilitation techniques that promoted student centered learning experiences; and systematic refinement of learning experience facilitation through an iterative process. Using design-based research methods in the form of a cyclic process of theoretical reflections, conceptual analysis, small-scale curriculum development, and classroom research of the interaction of the novel teaching-learning processes, the project team arrived at a final set of characteristics for engineering-design based project challenges for middle school students.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-61284-469-5; POD:978-1-61284-468-8; USB:978-1-61284-467-1","10.1109/FIE.2011.6143034","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6143034","design-based education research;engineering design process;middle school;project-based challenges","Cities and towns;Educational institutions;Engineering education;Robot sensing systems;Software;Temperature sensors","educational institutions;engineering education;teaching","National Science Foundation;apprenticeships;classroom research;conceptual analysis;design-based research methods;engineering education program;engineering-based project;hands-on learning experiences;instructional planning;iterative process;learning cycle;learning experience facilitation;learning experiences;learning facilitation techniques;middle school engineering education;middle school students;middle school teachers;professional engineers;small-scale curriculum development;student centered learning experiences;systematic refinement;teaching experiences;undergraduate engineering students;university experts;year-round extracurricular program","","0","","38","","","","12-15 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Object oriented design patterns are represented in our game in the form of actions that can be assigned to lemmings. The actions are metaphors for object oriented design patterns in software development, which means the student is not actually developing a design for a real software system.

This process consists of two coupled tanks and a pump to feed the liquid to the system. The process variables (levels) are transmitted to the PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) thought a voltage signal. The control signal, in volts, generated in the PLC, is sent to the pump. The control objective (regulator problem) is to keep the tanks levels in the considered operation point even in disturbance presence. The RMPC is a technique that allows explicit incorporation of the plant uncertainty in the problem formulation. The goal is to design, at each time step, a state-feedback control law that minimizes a 'worst-case' infinite horizon objective function, subject to constraint in the control input. The existence of a feedback control law and satisfying the input constraints is reduced to a convex optimization over linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) problem. It is shown that for the plant uncertainty described by the polytope, the feasible receding horizon state feedback control design is robustly stabilizing. The software implementation of the RMPC is made using Scilab, and its communication with Coupled Tanks Systems is done through the OLE for Process Control (OPC) industrial protocol.","1553-572X;1553572X","Electronic:978-1-61284-972-0; POD:978-1-61284-969-0; USB:978-1-61284-971-3","10.1109/IECON.2011.6119358","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6119358","","Mathematical model;Optimization;Predictive control;Predictive models;Robustness;Uncertainty","control engineering computing;control system synthesis;convex programming;linear matrix inequalities;predictive control;process control;programmable controllers;protocols;robust control;state feedback;tanks (containers);uncertain systems","LMI robust predictive control;OLE for process control;OPC industrial protocol;PLC;RMPC software implementation;Scilab;control signal;convex optimization;coupled tanks systems;linear matrix inequalities;online control strategy;plant uncertainty;programmable logic controller;receding horizon state feedback control design;robust model predictive control technique;robust stabilization;state-feedback control law;voltage signal;worst-case infinite horizon objective function","","2","","18","","","","7-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, typical P300 paradigm is modified by adding animation guide of the finger press as a stimulus and by using different response strategies (silent counting and actual/imaginary left or right index finger press following the animation). Both P300 potentials and sensory-motor rhythms are directly exploited and discussed. Classification results showed that even under very demanding conditions, which was, 200ms inter-stimulus interval of the P300 stimuli and actual/imaginary finger press once per 1.6s, the paradigm can evoke both P300 potentials and sensory-motor rhythms simultaneously. Actual finger press increased single trial P300 selection accuracy of different subjects by 5-29.5% compared with silent counting; imaginary finger press did not increase the P300 selection accuracy apparently for most subjects except the two who were very poor at counting task. This showed by using different interface design and adopting certain mental response strategies, the `BCI illiteracy' may be cured. Also imaginary task had good performance of left versus right classification (with the best subject reached 81.1% of accuracy), which is an additional information that can be used to improve system performance.","1094-687X;1094687X","Electronic:978-1-4577-1589-1; POD:978-1-4244-4121-1; USB:978-1-4244-4122-8","10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091569","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6091569","","Accuracy;Animation;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Presses;Thumb","bioelectric potentials;brain-computer interfaces;medical signal processing;signal classification","BCI illiteracy;P300 BCI paradigm;P300 based BCI;brain-computer interface;counting task;evoked P300 potentials;finger press task classification;imaginary finger press tasks;interface design;mental response strategies;real finger press tasks;sensory motor rhythms","Adult;Algorithms;Attention;Brain;Electroencephalography;Event-Related Potentials, P300;Female;Fingers;Hand;Humans;Imagination;Male;Models, Statistical;Motor Skills;Reproducibility of Results;Software;User-Computer Interface","0","","15","","","","Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 3 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The predominant end users such as the teachers (otherwise referred to as academics) and students need to have the relevant technical skills and knowledge to use the platform to meet their respective needs for teaching and learning. Technically, as a converging platform, the VLE has to be reasonably robust in its capacity to support the end users not only in terms of repository usage but also in facilitating the interactive activities that generate high digital traffic. To create a working VLE environment, it is essential to consider some key areas such as mandates of the HEIs pertaining to the educational delivery methods, the functional needs of the course delivery, teaching design and requirements, technical skills and needs of the diverse population of the academics and students. This report explores and discusses the realms of the converging platform and the diverse end users, and how HEIs are managing these aspects to meet the future needs of each in-coming cohort of students who enter HEIs with a background that is increasingly exposed to converging technologies, as well as updating the skills and knowledge of the existing users. It also considers the balance needed to achieve the right ""mix"" of technology and technical capacity on offer.

"Women in engineering: Statistical analysis of ACT data and proposed procedure to reverse trend","T. Iskander; P. Gore; A. Bergerson; C.

This disparity can be observed in many countries, though it is most evident in the US. In this paper we analyze historical ACT data over a 30-year span and correlate gender differences with ACT scores and expressed interest in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) related college majors. SPSS software was used to analyze the data and examine the historical trends of students' expressed interest in STEM related majors. Results show that there is a significant discrepancy between the number of men and women students who expressed interest in engineering majors. The data also show that social influences such as the emergence of computer fields including computer gaming and the dot.com era have profound influence in students' interest in STEM fields. To help develop specific strategies for timely remediation and help reverse this trend students were grouped into three categories - well prepared (ACT ≥ 28), under prepared (27 ≤ ACT ≥ 19), and unprepared (ACT <;19). Of the total number of students who expressed interest in engineering majors there are many who appear either completely unprepared or relatively under prepared for the demands of these fields. Results from this analysis demonstrate the importance of earlier interventions to encourage students who still have enough time to prepare for opportunities that interest them. It is also probable that students are making college major choices based on little or no data, and may, therefore, be at retention risk if they are admitted into an engineering program. This paper also highlights ongoing efforts to share data and work with high school counselors in an effort to help students identify more realistic career options or to timely target students for effective math remediation and help encourage increased participation in STEM majors and careers. Based on the data fou- d in these analyses, we will next be surveying high school career guidance counselors. This survey will help gain insight into the high school counselors' understanding and potential biases regarding engineering and engineers.","1522-3965;15223965","Electronic:978-1-4244-9563-4; POD:978-1-4244-9562-7","10.1109/APS.2011.5996556","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5996556","","Computers;Educational institutions;Electrical engineering;Engineering profession;Mathematics;Organizations;Psychology","computer aided instruction;educational institutions;gender issues;statistical analysis","ACT data;STEM;US;college;computer gaming;engineering education;high school counselor;professional career;statistical analysis","","2","","8","","","","3-8 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

During educational process, students have assignments to implement software projects. Some of these projects are organized as teamwork. Within teamwork they need to organize, monitor and evaluate their work until results are completed and submitted to teaching staff. This way students are preparing for measuring performance of development process simulating professional environment. Proposed balanced scorecard model include key performance indicators that are used for evaluation of student individual and teamwork results, software metrics and educational goals achievements.

In current studies, the search ranges of these components are always pre-defined carefully by expert designers, making it difficult for practical applications. In this paper, the search space is freely set to the commonly used ranges and an efficient orthogonal learning particle swarm optimization (OLPSO) is applied to optimally design the PEC with such search space. OLPSO uses an orthogonal learning (OL) strategy for PSO to discover useful information that lies in the personal historical best experience and the neighborhood's best experience via orthogonal experimental design. Therefore, OLPSO can construct a more promising and efficient exemplar to guide particle to fly better towards the global optimal region. OLPSO is implemented to optimize the design of a buck regulator in PEC. The optimized results are compared with those obtained by using a genetic algorithm (GA) approach and those obtained by using PSO with traditional learning strategy. Results show that the OLPSO algorithm is more promising in the design and optimization of the PEC with large search space. Moreover, the simulations results demonstrate the advantages of OLPSO by showing that the circuit optimized by OLPSO exhibits better startup and large-signal disturbance performance when compared with the one optimized by GA.","1089-778X;1089778X","Electronic:978-1-4244-7835-4; POD:978-1-4244-7834-7","10.1109/CEC.2011.5949937","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949937","Control systems;optimization;orthogonal experimental design (OED);particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Algorithm design and analysis;Capacitors;Genetic algorithms;Inductors;Optimization;Power electronics;Resistors","electronic engineering computing;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;power electronics","OLPSO algorithm;PEC optimization;capacitors;free search range;genetic algorithm;inductors;large-signal disturbance performance;orthogonal learning particle swarm optimization;power electronic circuit optimization;resistors","","2","","32","","","","5-8 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This presentation will cover recent developments in the theory of negative imaginary systems and their application to the control of highly resonant flexible structures. The theory of negative imaginary systems arose out of a desire to unify a number of classical methods for the control of lightly damped structures with collocated force actuators and position sensors including positive position feedback and integral force feedback. The key result is a stability result which shows why these methods are guaranteed to yield robust closed loop stability in the face of unmodelled spillover dynamics. Related results to be presented connect the theory of negative imaginary systems to positive real systems theory and a negative imaginary lemma has been established which is analogous to the positive real lemma. The presentation will also discuss recent controller synthesis results based on the theory of negative imaginary systems along with applications in the aerospace area such as the control of large space flexible structures.","1093-0175;10930175","Electronic:978-1-4577-0348-5; POD:978-1-4577-0349-2","10.1109/CSEET.2011.5876149","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5876149","","","","","","1","","2","","","","22-24 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Requirement analysis and multimedia interactive courseware testing involved teachers and preschoolers from National Child Development Research Centre (NCDRC), Sultan Idris Education University, Perak, Malaysia. This courseware development consists of many crucial decision-making stages such as analysis, design, development, implementation and evaluation (ADDIE model). Within analyzing phase, the instructional problem is clarified, the goals and objectives are established, and the learning environment and learner characteristics are identified. Design phase is a phase where instructional strategies are designed and media choices are made. In the developmental phase, materials are produced according to decision making in design phase. The implementation phase included testing of prototypes (with targeted audience) and putting the product in full production. Formative evaluation is presented in each stage whilst summative evaluation covers criterion-related reference items test and providing opportunities for user's feedback. Final study on PMICMO's content understanding and usability towards 15 NCDRC, UPSI preschoolers (Malay)and 10 preschoolers (non-Malay) around Tanjong Malim district in Perak, Malaysia indicate that all 100% preschoolers simply understand the content being disseminated. All 100% NCDRC preschoolers understand the Malay language being used in PMICMO and about 70% non-Malay preschoolers can also understood it well. Every directive instruction on PMICMO was read to 30% non-Malay preschoolers before they start to use it. For usability, it showed that 100% NCDRC preschoolers successfully used PMICMO without any difficulties and 70% of non-Malay preschoolers can operate PMICMO without any problems. The - - rest (30%) were aided by researcher during the early stage of using mouse. Findings from PMICMO testing indicated that 100% preschoolers are well-satisfied with this courseware and gain fast understanding on a given topic.

Recently, one important application direction of SOC is to compose the Web-delivered services (SOAP and RESTful Web services, RSS/Atom feeds, etc) for new Web applications (e.g., the Web mashups). Due to the fact that a number of Web-delivered services fetch data from remote servers, Web applications might require browser cache in order to cooperate with the performance issues (e.g. traffic and latency). However, cache strategies are usually predefined by service providers and brought into effect by browsers. Such pattern of cache makes developers, who are exactly responsible of composing services for Web applications, hardly customize their own cache strategies according to their own application contexts. We argue that, these limited cache strategies may cause unnecessary communications and reduce user experience. This paper proposes a browser-side cache framework for Web-delivered services composition. The main efforts of this paper are as follows. Firstly, our framework allows developers to customize their own cache strategies, such as expiration time, cache granularity and so forth. Secondly, we propose an adaptive technique to adjust cache strategies dynamically, in order to improve cache performance. Finally, we evaluate our framework by conducting experimental studies with the real-world Web-delivered services.","2163-2871;21632871","Electronic:978-1-4244-9801-7; POD:978-1-4244-9802-4","10.1109/SOCA.2010.5707138","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5707138","Web-delivered service;cache;composite application","Adaptation model;Browsers;Data models;Meteorology;Servers;Time frequency analysis;Web services","Web services;cache storage;service-oriented architecture","RESTful Web services;RSS-Atom feeds;SOAP;Web delivered service composition;browser based framework;data cache;service oriented computing","","0","","15","","","","13-15 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has led to the development of an educational computer game, entitled Shortfall, which simulates a business milieu for testing alternative paths regarding the principles of sustainability. This paper examines social sustainability in the context of industry and through the lens of a capital-based theory of sustainability.

A great challenge is presented to Superior Education Institutions: to establish the link between traditional cycles: technical, technology and professional ones with the secondary, basic and media levels. Our solution is presented linking each phase with a propedaeutic component discussed in a model. The model is dialogically integrated by cognitive an informational components. A structural system to determine and analyze the cohesion and coherence of the propedaeutic cycles between competences and the curriculum knowledge. This construct enables curricular knowledge management inside the media and higher education. Several types of matrices are developed; firstly regarding columns: the longitudinal one in time (semesters); secondly the cross one grouped by curriculum subjects, (additionally each cell of them can be expressed by fuzzy values); thirdly regarding the structure: the input/output for optimization purposes. An individualized model of student productivity to be integrated to counteract the stereotypes which considers the technical and technological cycles as relegated careers in higher education. This model is an intelligent knowledge based one which was validated with a software prototype just implemented in the FESSJ. This construct has as its mission the guarantee of quality assurance of student's propaedeutic cycles. A multidimensional flexibility system supported on university autonomy for managing student, pedagogical, and curricular knowledge which enables the management of the heterogeneous and complex environment; this subsystem is intended to ensure continuity and permanence of the student. The earlier is framed within a construct of curriculum knowledge and information. From this it is intended to reduce the high complexity of the harmonization and articulation of the propaedeutic cycles which face the - niversities when undertaking these projects. Moreover, it is pursued to offer major clarity to the educational community and in this way to contribute to the democratization of the involved knowledge within this methodological strategic articulating efforts according to the policy of the Colombian Government which seeks not only to increase the educational population but also to a major access of the marginalized social population and of those of lower revenues in order to fulfill the right to information executed by the National Constitution of this country.","2165-9559;21659559","Electronic:978-1-4244-6571-2; POD:978-1-4244-6568-2","10.1109/EDUCON.2010.5492566","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5492566","ICT;Propaedeutic cycles;expertise;intelligent knowledge based system;knowledge management;matrix of curricular coherence;media and Higher education;model;student's model","Analytical models;Coherence;Educational products;Educational technology;Engineering profession;Environmental management;Joining processes;Knowledge based systems;Knowledge management;Productivity","educational courses;educational institutions;further education;knowledge based systems;knowledge management","Colombian government;FESSJ;curricular knowledge management;education institutions;educational community;educational population;higher education;intelligent knowledge;knowledge based analytical model;knowledge based system;media education;multidimensional flexibility system;national constitution;optimization;propaedeutic cycles;quality assurance;social population;software prototype;universities","","1","","10","","","","14-16 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In present teaching scenario, polytechnics are still practicing the traditional approach in classroom such as pen-and-paper or exam-based learning. Students can no longer survive by memorizing textbooks, they now need to explore and experience genuine tasks that connects to the real-world; in which they can develop, master, and demonstrate authentic skills. Engineering Education needs to move from an instructive to constructivist approach. Problem based learning (PBL) is one of the constructivist approaches where cooperation among learners plays important role in the learning method. Project is one of the core subjects in Polytechnic system which carrying 2.5 credit hours. Students will be assessed based on their performance throughout the projects as well as the final outcome of the projects. Generally, most of this final projects designed by students are lack of creative and innovative except a few only. This approach differs in certain aspects from conventional learning. In normal conventional classes, students normally learned based on what the lecturers delivered in class. This study compares the learning and study strategies of project course by using PBL and traditional approach between two groups of the students of the Department of Electrical Engineering in Polytechnic Port Dickson. The research proposed the cognitive constructive learning model (ADDIE) in Problem Oriented Project Based to study to what extend does PBL improve the performance of students project with respect to the conventional method of learning.

The model integrates four main instructional strategies at the program level: mentoring; participation in an online community of professional learning and practice; collaborative concept-mapping with an object-typed knowledge modeling software, and face-to-face seminars in a work setting. Based on interview and observation data collected during two successive small-scale experimentations of the model, we explored potential factors that could have had an impact on students' academic retention and achievement. Four types of factors were identified: personal, professional, institutional and pedagogical. We found that pedagogical and professional factors, which are insufficiently considered in theoretical models of student retention, are of primary concern for students who work full-time as professionals. A blended learning model designed at the program level and strongly “situated” in the professional practice of the students is a promising avenue to adjust to their career constraints and aspirations and, thus, promoting their academic retention and achievement.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5792-2; POD:978-1-4244-4810-4","10.1109/ITHET.2010.5480102","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5480102","Blended Learning;Curriculum Design;Design-Based Research;Non-Traditional Students;Professional Learning;Student Retention","Application specific processors;Collaborative software;Collaborative work;Computer aided instruction;Education;Educational programs;Employee welfare;Engineering profession;Online Communities/Technical Collaboration;Seminars","educational courses;educational institutions;further education;professional aspects","academic retention promotion;blended learning model;collaborative concept mapping;face-to-face seminars;full-time professional workers;higher education professional study programs;in-service teachers;object typed knowledge modeling software;professional learning;school administration;university professional study program","","1","","25","","","","April 29 2010-May 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Combinations of real and virtual technical plants and automation systems are used in different learning scenarios for teaching control and automation concepts. Configurations of interchangeable components can be dynamically created via a VLE by configuring database parameters. The proposed system includes a remote Web interface that follows a thin client strategy and is designed to be compatible with Web browsers, including basic Java support. As the architecture that supports the integration of virtual and real components is located on the server side, remote students/users are only concerned with the experiment and do not need to be aware of the system that provides this integration and flexibility. In the current version, interchangeable components are integrated via an Object Linking and Embedding for Process Control interface, which is a widely adopted standard in the control and automation area. The proposed approach also provides practical and theoretical support for experiments within a collaborative virtual environment.

Searching for methodologies to support effective authoring of serious games (SGs), we have abstracted a model consisting of a 3D geo-referenced virtual world (VW) where knowledge is implemented also through tasks that are disseminated across the environment. The model is designed to support authors to focus on defining the tasks' content and annotation (e.g. relevance to various topics, difficulty, position in the VW, typology of supported learning styles, interrelation with other tasks and events, etc.), without being asked to do game scripting, which typically involves hardcoding events, actions, locations and contents of a specific game. Task annotation allows reusing tasks also in different games. Moreover, different game designers can exploit repositories of tasks and build educational games specifying a VW, and its missions as sequences of tasks that meet learning strategy criteria that can be expressed through the proposed framework. This model opens new perspectives to pedagogical experts and game designers to develop runtime game engines able to provide players with adaptive contents.

Because of the inter-population operator, the individualspsila diversity will not turn worse due to the shrunken population size.

The weakness using conventional PI controllers in the temperature control of the test room is analyzed. To improve the control performance over PI controllers, an adaptive fuzzy PI controller is developed. In the proposed control scheme, the increment of the PI controller parameters can be adjusted online by fuzzy rules according to the error of the controlled variable and the change of the error. Thus, PI controller parameters of the proposed control strategy can be optimized under close-loop operation.

We discuss the design and delivery of a masters course in software requirements engineering (SRE) that is designed to overcome some of the issues that have caused the research-practice gap. By encouraging students to share their experiences in a peer learning environment, we aim to improve shared understanding between students (many of whom are current industry practitioners) and researchers (including academic staff members) to improve the potential for effective collaborations, whilst simultaneously developing the requirements engineering skill sets of the enrolled students.

Integrated projects would be a good opportunity to practice this concept if it had been better direction to this objective since it is a longer project that is supported by many chairs. Those projects use to presents the business rules and requirements to the students withdrawing from them the chance to exercises the domain and requirement engineering. It was made an experience to close that gap, so, 20 students were asked to get the requirements to a project. It was expected that the students should got requirements using the use case approach, also, they should realizes the need of domain engineering to empower the requirement's elicitation process. The need of this realization is based on the learning strategy used on the experience called problem-based learning (PBL) where the students should find solutions to a stated problem even before the presentation of the proper concepts that best solves the problem, so, in this study the need of domain engineering was not formally defined. To perform the strategy, the problem should had defined in a way which avoids the student's business rules intuitive inferences, so, it was defined a problem in an unknown domain. Another property of the problem is that should be a unique distributed system sharing the same business rules even the groups had different requirements. It was expected that the students got the requirements and realizes the need of domain engineering from a high level stakeholders' need in a 18 weeks time frame. Despite this, the students neither got requirements neither realizes the domain engineering needs during the first 5 weeks (27% of the time frame) they just had asking to the professor ""which are the requirements?"" and did not performed any requirements procedures. Supposing a conceptual problem, the use case approach concep- ts were retrieved, but it were realized that there were not a conceptual problem, so, the next logical step is consider concept's transfer problems. It was performed a transfer procedure where starting from a high level need, going through the approach till got the first classes of a rental software system (a well know domain to focuses the approach) the domain engineering aspects are commented as demanded by the students. During the transfer, the students tried to just create the requirements on a intuitively way on this time, they had been pushed back to follow the approach and get the requirements using it. During this activity, they once again, tried to escape from the procedure outweigh the lack of business rules just intuitively creating them, once again, they were induced to obtain and elicit the business rules and not just create them. The second part of the induction was very important since it was used to instigate on the students the curiosity about the domain engineering becoming a start point to the solution's search as defined by PBL. Once the transfer procedure was accomplished, the students started to ask the ""correct questions"" and the project could be started. After this point, the students should realizes the need of a unified domain engineering to the whole project positioning themselves as parts of the system, once again it did not happened and a new transfer procedure was made. In this transfer procedure was enough just help the students retrieve the distributed system's concepts and help them to identify each module and their position on them. During the transfer procedure the professor realizes that the students did not considered the modules communications and they had started to create incompatible modules leading the professor to start a new induction to solve this problem. From this point to the end, the project had a normal development.

We conducted a think-aloud study with 15 students in a graduate-level computer science class to discover the strategies that students apply, and to what effect, in performing corrective maintenance on concurrent software. We collected think-aloud and action protocols, and annotated the protocols for a number of behavioral attributes and maintenance strategies. We divided the protocols into groups based on the success of the participant in both diagnosing and correcting the failure. We evaluated these groups for statistically significant differences in these attributes and strategies. In this paper, we report a number of interesting observations that came from this study. All participants performed diagnostic executions of the program to aid program comprehension; however, the participants that used this as their predominant strategy for diagnosing the fault were all unsuccessful. Among the participants that successfully diagnosed the fault and displayed high confidence in their diagnosis, we found two commonalities. They all recognized that the fault involved the violation of a concurrent-programming idiom.

These pricing schemes range from simple approaches, easily copied by competitors, to complex models with high management costs. In order to be successful in today's competitive business world, the service providers need to define their pricing strategies by considering the customer's perceived value from the service they receive rather than using traditional cost-based pricing strategies.

The education world is experiencing a change not just in terms of curriculum but also in terms of approaches to teaching and learning strategies. These changes in learning strategies from traditional to dynamic strategies based on the use of information technology create a learner centered learning environment. The most important role of an instructor in an online environment is a high degree of interactivity and participation. This means designing and conducting learning activities that result in engagement with the subject matter and with fellow learners using proper pedagogical approaches are very important.The development of e-Learning in the sciences in general and in mathematics in particular has not met the general expectations. The instructional design of the teaching of mathematics incorporates the elements on mathematical approaches, hierarchy of teaching, interactive multimedia, systematically designed and developed teaching and learning modules and sub modules, and holistic development of students OO (Object-Oriented) analysis and design techniques were developed to help in the modeling of business, the analysis of requirements and the design software. With the rapid growth of OO technology, a number of techniques in OO have been developed and integrated. UML was designed to bring together the best feature of a number of analysis and design techniques and notations to produce an industry standard.The unified modeling language (UML) is an effective and popular notation which is used to capture high-level designs for software systems. However, one aspect of software system design which is not typically captured in a UML document is a record of the likely (or desired) rate of performance of the major activities of the system.

Problem-based learning (PBL) is a methodology that can help the students to explore and put to use their own resources, and it can be applied to a wide range of students and subject matters. The project incorporates aspects of electrical engineering and computing skills. This study is dedicated to the learning process to help students to deal with the complexity of an electric power network. This study has conducted a new methodology in educational research by adopting technology for teaching and learning. PBL, as an instructional strategy of active learning, was used and adapted for use in analysis in electrical power systems programme. This methodology addresses many of the concerns of teachers and professional organizations. Above all, it encourages students to be in charge of their education. It emphasizes critical thinking skills, understanding, learning how to learn, and working cooperatively with others. The benefits of PBL in the electrical power systems course are seen in the way students improved the study and analysis of the security in an electrical power system. This method can also be seen as a benefit for electric power systems where educators strive for improved teaching and learning.","","CD-ROM:978-88-89884-09-6; POD:978-1-4244-3294-3","10.1109/UPEC.2008.4651687","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4651687","","Education;Educational technology;Electrical engineering;Electrical engineering computing;Power engineering computing;Power system analysis computing;Power system dynamics;Power system modeling;Power system security;Software packages","computer aided instruction;power engineering education;power system security","Power World 11.0 software;electrical power system security analysis;problem-based learning","","1","","14","","","","1-4 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The experiment with 20 participants also reveals that the diagrammatic complexity and the degree of causal chaining are the properties of diagrams that affect understanding, reasoning and problem solving with conceptual modeling representations. In a follow-up study with 24 university students, it is seen that these properties are independent of gender.

However it is not easy for students who are still not very well-versed in object-oriented technologies to learn this course well. Many CS and SE students find it difficult to apprehend. Even though they understand the patterns themselves, it is still hard for them to use these patterns in practical projects. It is a challenge for teachers to make their students understand the kernel of design patterns in a limited amount of teaching hours. In this paper we discuss several problems in teaching design patterns and introduce our practical experience of teaching design patterns by applying a modified problem-based learning pedagogy.

This is implemented by mining two kinds of features for each sentence: the power of correlation with the query and the power of global connectivity. While the first is executed by computing semantic similarity between the sentence and the query, and the other is executed by using semantic graph. Then these two kinds of features are blessed to score each sentence. At last with the help of MMR for reducing redundancy, we get the summary.

In this mode of instruction, the Chinese teaching assistants conducted interactive classes using both the video materials and a classroom interaction system (Classroom Presenter) for electronically supported student activities. These activities were done using a system of networked Tablet PCs, which allowed the students to electronically submit their work to the instructor, and enabled the instructor to display student submissions as well as ink on the lecture slides.

Aiming to explore the learning-object paradigm, it was modeled, built, and tested a learning-object database that is part of a collaborative environment, which supports distance learning of computer programming languages. One of the available standards was adopted, the learning object metadata standard - LOM. In order to build and manipulate the learning-object database, some strategies showed to be necessary and thus they were defined.

The wind turbine model details the mechanism of variable speed operation of the turbine by a pitch control. The control schemes in the paper include a pitch angle control for the wind turbine and a speed control for the generator. The pitch angle control uses wind speeds and electric power output as the input signals to ensure normal operation in high wind speed. The speed control is realized through field orientation where the d-axis current is set to zero and the q-axis current is used to control the rotational speed of the generator according to the variation of wind speed.

It is a challenge task to design an IPTV oriented E-Learning system and deliver web-based learning resources to the new IPTV platform. In this paper we study the learning process on IPTV platform and present the design methodology of an interactive IPTV-based E-Learning system. Several critical issues have been investigated carefully. At first a service framework for IPTV based E-Learning service is introduced. The interoperability with other traditional web-based learning system is enabled by the introduction of several interfaces based on Web Services. Then new development methods of IPTV-Oriented learning resources are then proposed. In addition, conversion strategies for traditional web-based learning resources to IPTV platform are also discussed. Thirdly we proposed the design methodologies for the learning interactivity, which is the key feature of IPTV-based application comparing to traditional VOD ones.

Computer aided training systems offer a flexible and cost-effective method for learning new skills. The satisfactory management of risk situations involves risk identification, the development of risk handling strategies and plans and the conduct and monitoring of those plans. Recognising the importance of tacit knowledge, scenario-based training has gained importance in recent years. For example, USA General Accounting Office (GAO) released a report on Homeland security titled Risk Management approach can guide preparedness efforts. This report provides a list of risk assessment measurements for contingency plan development and a matrix for risk-based scenario development. In this paper, integrating traditional scenario-based training with desktop VR systems using game engineering, we investigate how a virtual reality training system, which draws on research in the areas of computer games, knowledge acquisition, agent technology and natural language processing, can provide a safe learning experience to assist acquisition of the necessary tacit knowledge. The aim of RiskMan is to train police officers to handle high-risk situations. RiskMan is an ARC Discovery project carried out by the Department of Computing in Macquarie University. RiskMan has been developed using a very-high level scripting language of a game engine, Unreal Tournament 2004. It is composed of modules such as a Scenario-based Expert System, a Narrative Engine, a Game Engine, and a CAD package.

We implement a novel hierarchical segment-based matching scheme to produce accurate disparity maps, which resolves the above mentioned challenging problems.

Since electronics is an important grounding for other disciplines (computer science, signal processing, and communications), this approach proposes the development of multidisciplinary projects using the project-based learning (PBL) strategy for increasing the attractiveness of the curriculum. The proposed curriculum structure consists of eight courses: four theoretical courses and four PBL courses (including a compulsory Master's thesis). In PBL courses, the students, working together in groups, develop multidisciplinary systems, which become progressively more complex. To address this complexity, the Department of Electronic Engineering has invested in the last five years in many resources for developing software tools and a common hardware. This curriculum has been evaluated successfully for the last four academic years: the students have increased their interest in electronics and have given the courses an average grade of more than 71% for all PBL course evaluations (data extracted from students surveys). The students have also acquired new skills and obtained very good academic results: the average grade was more than 74% for all PBL courses. An important result is that all students have developed more complex and sophisticated electronic systems, while considering that the results are worth the effort invested","0018-9359;00189359","","10.1109/TE.2006.879784","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1668283","Curriculum design;Electronic Systems Curricula;project-based learning;software and hardware tools for education","Application software;Computer science;Computer science education;Data mining;Grounding;Hardware;Laboratories;Signal design;Signal processing;Software tools","educational aids;educational courses;electronic engineering education","Department of Electronic Engineering;electronic systems curricula design;multidisciplinary projects;project-based learning;software tools","","64","","15","","","","Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The user should be able to access information from e-learning documents in a user friendly way, that is by questioning the system in their native language Hindi and the system returns the intended answer (also in Hindi) by searching in context from the repository of Hindi documents. The language constructs, query structure, common words, etc. are completely different in Hindi as compared to English. A novel strategy, in addition to conventional search and NLP techniques, was used to construct the Hindi QA system. The focus is on context based retrieval of information. For this purpose we implemented a Hindi search engine that works on locality-based similarity heuristics to retrieve relevant passages from the collection. It also incorporates language analysis modules like stemmer and morphological analyzer as well as self constructed lexical database of synonyms.

Results from this study indicate that TDD can be an effective software design approach improving both code-centric aspects such as object decomposition, test coverage, and external quality, and developer-centric aspects including productivity and confidence. In addition, iterative development approaches that include automated testing demonstrated benefits over a more traditional linear approach with manual tests.

At the Rochester Institute of Technology, the undergraduate introductory software engineering course has been redesigned from a traditional lecture-lab format to a project-centric studio format. The student team focus has allowed us to better incorporate active learning by promoting collaboration among students and instructors in the development of a term long software project. In order to make the studio format more effective we have adopted a blended learning approach. Blended learning aims to join the best of face-to-face classroom learning with the best of online teaching and learning to promote active independent learning and reduce class seat time. Student satisfaction in courses requiring a collaborative effort among their peers is heavily influenced by their project team experience. The use of blended learning techniques helps to make the experience a more satisfying one by increasing the effectiveness of collaboration in team activities and interaction with the instructor through the application of distance learning and social computing technologies. The challenges faced and the techniques and strategies utilized in the planning and delivery of the course was discussed, including the utilization of online learning support infrastructure.

We have undergone a revolution in evolving mechatronics content in our curricula from limited coursework in instrumentation to one or more courses in mechatronics. However, mechatronics or dynamic systems courses tend to use a few pre-defined examples that are narrow in training experience for the students. When multiple components are incorporated into a laboratory or project, these courses tend to focus on the interfacing problem at the expense of a system view. The issues concerning optimization of the complete system to meet given requirements is not well considered. Integration of the mechanical elements, the electronic elements, and frequently the embedded software to meet a system requirement are often not an emphasis. We believe that laboratory design exercises based on actual design cases are an opportunity to provide a more comprehensive exposure to mechatronics design. These laboratory exercises can be structured to provide experience and exposure in integration of mechanical and electronics systems, system level analysis and design, and application of network communications in mechatronic systems. Several case studies, which have been used as a catalyst to various mechatronics projects at Oklahoma State University, are discussed.","0743-1619;07431619","Electronic:0-7803-9099-7; POD:0-7803-9098-9","10.1109/ACC.2005.1470054","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1470054","","Aerodynamics;Automatic control;Communication system control;Education;Embedded software;Instruments;Laboratories;Mechanical engineering;Mechatronics;Vehicle dynamics","control engineering education;design;mechanical engineering;mechatronics","dynamic systems courses;electronics systems;embedded software;mechanical design curricula;mechatronics design;network communications;system level analysis","","0","","13","","","","8-10 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is a discipline whose importance is growing more and more apparent. It is also one of ten essential areas recommended by computing curriculum software engineering (CCSE) 2003. In spite of its importance, there are almost no dedicated courses at the undergraduate level covering this important discipline, although there is definite interest [J. Tomakyo et al., (2004)]. At Southern Polytechnic State University, as part of our BS in software engineering, we have started offering a course on software architecture and design, which focuses on designing software, at the highest level (software architecture) and the detailed level. In this paper we detail the contents and the pedagogical approach of that course. We describe the structure of this course, its knowledge units, which include design principles, design strategies, architectural design and attributes, detailed design, component-oriented design, and design support tools and evaluation.

This generates problems because the students failing first year courses cannot move on to higher level courses. Not only can this be devastating for individual students, but it can also affect the variety of higher level courses. In an attempt to prevent these problems we focused on the introductory programming courses (CS1) in order to enhance the opportunities for the students to become successful. One action taken was a research project initiated to radically change the way object-oriented programming is taught in CS1. Another action was to introduce the supplemental instruction programme (SI). SI helps students master content while they develop and integrate learning and study strategies.

"Sun Tzu and sustainable competitive advantage","MuChiu Chang","Dept. of Inf. Manage., Ching Yun Univ., Taiwan","2004 IEEE International Engineering Management Conference (IEEE Cat. No.04CH37574)","20050404","2004","1","","153","157 Vol.1","Sustainable competitive advantage (SCA) has been a strategic concern to enterprises. In the era of knowledge economy, such an advantage migrates to the human-brain oriented intangible assets, or, intellectual property right (IPR). Combined with strategy, this brings up the importance of multi-disciplinary integration and business renovation in management infrastructure for the sake of SCA. Because a strong philosophical foundation is the key to the success in such a renovation, we explore the philosophical foundation for the SCA based on ""Sun Tzu: The Art of War"". First of all, we find that using modeling and simulation for SCA evaluation and decision-making is a modern trend of implementing Sun Tzu's concept of ""temple calculation"". Our patent-pending works in virtual validation and verification of product specifications by modeling simulation have strategic importance in securing a market, which can be deemed a SCA. Second, Sun Tzu's defensive philosophy of ""securing ourselves first"" is preferable because it is a protracted combat no matter in IPR or building up company's SCA. The human-brain orientation of IPR impacts the traditional business management concepts and infrastructure, which are deemed less incentive. We found that though Sun Tzu invoked the importance of ""Dao"" to unify people and encourage people to fight, but he did provide any hint to the problem of ""Where does the ""Dao"" come from?"" nor did he provide any solution to the problem of ""What is the ""Dao"" that can encourage people to think and to offer the fruits of their intellectual activities?"" Though we have found that the ownership of IPR and the company's vision and branding strategy may be the mapping of Sun Tzu's ""Dao"" in the modern knowledge economy time, we still propose intensive researches in philosophy, especially the Chinese ancient philosophy for excavation in-depth. Finally, we notice that IPR can bring new opportunities to individuals with know-how and skill, while INTERNET and World Wide Web (WWW) along with open source software provide a new platform for innovators in education (e-learning), creating innovation and manipulating marketing and strategy with low cost. This means that open source software provides a low-cost solution for creating SCA.","","POD:0-7803-8519-5","10.1109/IEMC.2004.1407095","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1407095","","Art;Decision making;Electronic learning;Intellectual property;Internet;Open source software;Sun;Technological innovation;Web sites;World Wide Web","Internet;business process re-engineering;decision making;industrial property;innovation management;knowledge management","INTERNET;Sun Tzu;WWW;World Wide Web;business renovation;decision-making;e-learning;human-brain oriented intangible asset;intellectual property right;knowledge economy;management infrastructure;sustainable competitive advantage","","2","1","34","","","","18-21 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With this motivation, we have designed ArcAngel, a tactic language especially tailored for refinement; we have formalised its semantics and studied its algebraic laws. Even with the use of tactics, however refinement can be a hard task and the use of tools is essential in practice.

The major purpose of the project was to provide a broad perspective on the design and implementation of wireless systems. When the course was first taught, we focused on LMDS (local multipoint distribution services), an up and coming broadband licensed system operating between 28 and 32 GHz., but the project has had wide applicability to other frequency bands as well. The classes and research funded under GETWEBS brought together students from engineering, business, and the social sciences to evaluate implementation strategies for modern wireless communications. A significant outcome of this project has been a diverse group of Virginia Tech graduates with a set of engineering, business, and spatial skills that are not being taught in combination anywhere else in the United States. These students have left the program with important science skills, spatial awareness and financial savvy to work in new multi-disciplinary occupations in 4G wireless telecommunications within the United States and around the world. The paper outlines the history of the project and describes the spatial analysis projects being carried out, based on NSF GETWEBS sponsorship.","","POD:0-7803-8196-3","10.1109/WCT.2003.1321505","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1321505","","Business communication;Costs;Finance;Frequency;Geographic Information Systems;Geography;Investments;Modems;Performance analysis;Wireless communication","4G mobile communication;broadband networks;computer based training;electrical engineering education;geographic information systems;geography;research initiatives;telecommunication engineering education;telecommunication network planning","4G wireless telecommunications;GIS;Geographic Engineering Tool for Wireless;LMDS;Virginia Tech;broadband licensed system;geographers;local multipoint distribution services;multi-disciplinary occupations;project software;spatial modeling;wireless system design;wireless system implementation;wireless systems","","0","","6","","","","15-17 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This situation establishes a programming-first approach in the overall curricular structure, and the resulting situation produces several unwanted side effects. One of the main problems is that students lack the abstraction capability they need in order to model software. For this reason, the practical classes of the first software engineering course have been organized in workshop sessions, where each session is devoted to a concrete modeling technique. A workshop session is built around a problem published on the teacher's website. The session is divided into two parts. In the first part, the students are organized into work groups, and they give an initial solution to the proposed modeling problem. In the second part of the session, one volunteer group presents its solution, and afterwards, in a moderated debate, the rest of the students discuss the proposed solution. Finally, the volunteer group writes a workshop session report that contains the final agreed-on solution. This approach has been successfully applied to the software modeling practical classes of a first software engineering course during the last five years, achieving important improvements in the students' abstraction capabilities, which is much needed in software modeling.","0018-9359;00189359","","10.1109/TE.2004.824839","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1296777","Improving classroom teaching;software engineering;teaching/learning strategies","","computer science education;educational courses;engineering education;software engineering","Spain;computer science studies;software engineering course;software modeling techniques;workshop-based approach","","4","","36","","","","May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This concentration has evolved only lately when people began to realize the importance of scalability and tailorability as opposed to generic strategies and approaches in software development. Modest efforts were there to build primitive taxonomies and frameworks. However, these efforts established a roadmap for forthcoming research. Yet, specialized system development is not only new and broad but also critical for the success of today's businesses and software developers alike. Generic approaches are considered weak strategies unless they are tailored to specific needs in terms of application scope, application nature or the certain requirements of industries or organizations .This requires extensive focus on the application domain of software systems. The rationale for this is the diversity of needs across system stakeholders, levels and types of business problems and resources that make the concept of one -size-fits-all almost obsolete. Some sub-generic super-specific areas can bridge the gap between common software development and specialized development since these areas are global to many industries but have strong focus on a specific application domain.","","POD:0-7803-7724-9","10.1109/ITRE.2003.1270587","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1270587","","Application software;Bridges;Glass;Problem-solving;Programming;Scalability;Software engineering;Software systems;Standardization;Taxonomy","software engineering;systems analysis","business problems;software development;specialized system development;system stakeholder","","0","","6","","","","11-13 Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Packaging related aspects are mainly covered by the technological design and electronic circuit's courses. The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence of such Electronic Packaging information in our curricula during the past ten years. The curricula restructuring process relies on the continuous adaptation and updating of the delivered teaching activities in order to compensate the main drawbacks of the last years: the student's change of professional interest from hardware design to software design and the technological gap between our current equipment endowment and the current level of technology worldwide required. Thus, the process of upgrading the equipment involved promoting actions for the IT features and benefits in design and teaching processes.

The strategy covers a large domain: from modern CAD tools to Internet access to relevant and useful information and even by creating new virtual platforms for Electronic Packaging lab sessions (e.g. using Matlab).

When they do enroll in postsecondary education they often experience difficulty staying in, and completing their programs. The purpose of this research was to determine if assistive technology, in the form of voice recognition software, could assist in overcoming some of the barriers that exist for people with learning disabilities. The study sought to determine if voice recognition software was an effective compensatory strategy for students with learning disabilities in postsecondary education and the experiences of these students in relationship to their use of the software. Follow-up data will be collected to determine if the software is an effective compensatory strategy for the participants in their future employment.","","POD:0-7695-1509-6","10.1109/CIE.2002.1186319","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1186319","","Continuing education;Costs;Educational institutions;Educational programs;Employment;Engineering profession;Pressing;Speech recognition;Statistics","computer aided instruction;handicapped aids;speech processing;teaching","CAI;assistive technology;compensatory strategy;learning disabilities;postsecondary education;postsecondary students;voice recognition software","","3","","11","","","","3-6 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, setting up appropriate laboratory facilities to serve this purpose is expensive. For this reason, an interactive learning environment has been developed around the concept of the electronic book. The architecture of the environment allows the integration of hypertext with simulators of DCS, PLC, and process operation. The simulators are specially designed to serve an application-oriented teaching approach, which involves the student in the simulation setup and the running of the application. They are able to simulate not only the execution of the software that realizes the regulatory control algorithms but also the start-up and emergency control strategies of an industrial process, the manual, automatic, and cascade modes of controller operation, and the man-machine interface of a DCS- or PLC-based control system. The applications on which the teaching of DCS and PLC-based control system implementation is based are the interactive advanced control of a distillation column and the pH control of a reactor solution.","0018-9359;00189359","","10.1109/TE.2002.808227","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1183682","","Application software;Automatic control;Control systems;Distributed computing;Distributed control;Education;Electronic publishing;Industrial control;Laboratories;Programmable control","computer aided instruction;computer science education;control engineering education;distributed control;electronic publishing;industrial control;programmable controllers;teaching","PLC;application-oriented teaching approach;distributed computer systems;emergency control strategies;industrial control systems computer implementation teaching;interactive electronic book;programmable logic controllers;regulatory control algorithms;start-up control strategies","","4","","26","","","","Feb 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To stimulate the student's interests of AI research and introduce the RoboCup games to more students, we transplant the RoboCup to an educational platform for students to study and research. This paper shows the structure and design of the whole platform, the specific implementation of basic modules on the educational platform. The platform is divided into three parts: low-level module, libraries, and program scheme. Students should work in the programming scheme part, build the basic skill and top-level strategy layer. This paper describes the main theory of the basic skills such as dribble, kick, and shoot, including the distributed planning in realizing these skills. The top-level strategy part analyzes the realization of several basic strategies and machine learning's impact on the game. We also provide the method and framework for implementing the basic skills and top-level strategy, called the qsinghuAeolus program. Finally, we show the educational value of the platform in RoboCup simulation games.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1174401","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174401","","Artificial intelligence;Computational modeling;Educational robots;Educational technology;Game theory;Intelligent robots;Learning systems;Libraries;Machine learning;Programming profession","control engineering education;digital simulation;intelligent control;learning (artificial intelligence);robots;software agents","RoboCup;distributed planning;education;intelligent robotics;machine learning;robotic soccer games;simulation games;top-level strategy","","1","","5","","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Center's goal is to enhance strategic planning by advancing the art and science of technology planning. A key feature of the center is a website at which industry associations, research organizations, and individuals can develop roadmaps that are stored in a common data format and posted for public access. As this archive of roadmaps grows, many unique opportunities will arise. In the area of roadmapping research, these include: data-mining across roadmaps from different industries; development of an ontology for technology roadmapping; and analyzing the dynamics of roadmaps over time. In the area of education, these opportunities include: new tools and topics for courses in technology planning and management; the use of roadmapping tools and techniques in undergraduate design courses; an Executive Masters program in technology roadmapping; and broader dissemination of technology information throughout society.","","POD:0-7803-7385-5","10.1109/IEMC.2002.1038558","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1038558","","Art;Companies;Educational programs;Educational technology;Ontologies;Software tools;Strategic planning;Technological innovation;Technology management;Technology planning","education;strategic planning;technology management","Center for Technology Roadmapping;Executive Masters program;Purdue University;common data format;data-mining;education;global economy;industry associations;ontology development;research;research organizations;strategic planning;technological innovation;technology forecasting;technology information dissemination;technology management;technology planning;undergraduate design courses;website","","1","1","11","","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They affect the organisations involved in creating, maintaining and using them and they can have a profound effect on the people involved, directly or indirectly. The causes of systems and project failures, vary considerably. Each case has to be taken in isolation and examined, to see where it has gone wrong in the past, or is starting to go wrong at present. In a true-life scenario, it is essential to be able to predict likely problems that may arise or accurately recognise failure symptoms when they occur. To achieve this it is important to be able to identify what is really going on and when these facts have been established, to be able to select a suitable means of handling the situation. Two European Esprit research projects examined software and multimedia quality practices and provided a framework for addressing these issues. These frameworks did not just promote best practices within software engineering, but sought to address some of the wider issues of systems and their role within the business.

A qualitative study of algorithm learning strategies of students and a usability study of a hypermedia algorithm animation system led to the conclusion that current algorithm animations may actually do more to hinder than help undergraduates develop a solid understanding of the algorithm, because of their learning strategies. Students relied on a single representation of an algorithm, misinterpreted the limitations and specifics of that representation, avoided using outside media sources and worked primarily within groups to understand algorithms. Thus, algorithm animation may have limited usefulness for this population. Therefore, to discourage students from relying on a single representation and to encourage them to be more self-directed and engaged learners, we have students create, share and collectively interpret their own algorithm representations","","POD:0-7695-1013-2","10.1109/ICALT.2001.943871","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=943871","","Algorithm design and analysis;Animation;Computer science;Education;Robustness;Software algorithms;Software engineering;Solids;Visualization;World Wide Web","computer animation;computer science education;human factors;hypermedia;program visualisation;social aspects of automation;teaching","algorithm animation;algorithm learning strategies;algorithm representations;current algorithm animations;hypermedia algorithm animation system;learning strategies;outside media sources;qualitative study;self-directed learners;teaching;undergraduate computer science students;undergraduate student learning strategy;usability study","","1","","4","","","","2001","06 Aug 2001-08 Aug 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work fits in the paradigm in which computers are used as cognitive tools to help learners recognize, judge and organize patterns of information. We adopt the concept of epistemic games and forms as discussed in Collins and Ferguson (1993). Epistemic games act as structured concept maps that help organize information. EPIGAME teaches epistemic games in the context of discussing some domain of interest. Faced with a task for organizing or creating knowledge, the learner is first presented with the epistemic form and then guided to fill in the epistemic form in order to organize or create knowledge. Her moves will be constrained by the rules of the game. In this paper, we propose and discuss the design of EPIGAME.

The author spent 18 months working with her engineering colleagues to develop strategies to enhance the incorporation of instructional technology in engineering classes. She concluded that (1) faculty development activities should first address the pedagogy, not the technology, (2) faculty peers must be involved in introducing instructional technology into an institution, and (3) the increase in technology use was directly related to the number of strategies in which the faculty participated.

If industry is to pay more attention to improving the usability of its software and systems, courses need to be established so that students gain knowledge and skills that are important in the real-world and experience realistic situations that address usability issues. To date, the provision of HCI education for practitioners has not been addressed substantively by most Australian universities. The paper describes the course that responds to industry needs.

The paper describes how to estimate model parameters from characteristics of the software components and characteristics of how test cases and operational usage stress the software components. The order in which test cases are run is used in combining component models to arrive at a composite reliability growth model of the software for the testing period. The paper walks through an example illustrating the effects on reliability growth of: selecting test cases based on an operational profile versus selecting them based on uniform coverage of test cases; and incremental delivery of software components to system test.

Proceedings of the Fifth International Symposium on","20020806","1999","2","","539","542 vol.2","In recent times, there has been a proliferation of activity in the area of flexible learning for tertiary institutions. Some of the reasons for this interest are that: (1) students have more options as to when and how they will learn; (2) distance education is far more practical; (3) staff teaching time can be reduced substantially in the long term; and (4) the computer animation achievable through currently available multimedia tools can enable more effective learning of difficult concepts; etc. Despite the potential benefits, the percentage of academic staff actively pursuing development of flexible delivery units in their courses is small. The reason for this reluctance is the seemingly daunting amount of effort required to produce the necessary multimedia tools. The time required to become proficient in multimedia packages is in itself a major deterrent. This paper describes one methodology for surprisingly efficient development of flexible delivery materials. The key to the methodology is to perform the development in a sequence of stages. The stages are designed so that useful products are available at the completion of all stages, even the first one. The approach has been trialed at RMIT with very encouraging success-class contact time has been substantially reduced and students are happy about the changes","","POD:1-86435-451-8","10.1109/ISSPA.1999.815729","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=815729","","Animation;Australia;Automatic testing;Distance learning;Education;Multimedia systems;Packaging;Signal processing;Software tools;Videos","computer aided instruction;computer animation;educational courses;electronic engineering education;multimedia computing;teaching","computer animation;courses;distance education;flexible learning material development strategy;multimedia packages;multimedia tools;staff teaching time;students","","0","","9","","","","1999","22 Aug 1999-25 Aug 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

During a three-hour ""laboratory"" period, students read and discussed four short case studies in engineering ethics. Discussion was guided to focus on understanding the (often conflicting) viewpoints of individuals within a case and to look for multiple courses of action for resolving the issue. The second learning goal was assessed prior to the case study laboratory and on two occurrences after the laboratory. Assessment results showed no changes in the number of different courses of action that students could enumerate to resolve ethical issues.

Easy equation sets have one unknown variable in each equation such that the equations can be solved sequentially. Hard equation sets have one critical unknown located in many (or all) of the equations in the set such that many (or all) of the equations must be solved simultaneously. We call these equations ""coupled"" and we teach students how they can analyze equation sets (based on the location of known and unknown variables) to ""decouple"" the equations and make the solution path easy. We describe the algorithm called the DeCoupler, which is used to identify variable interactions to determine the optimal decoupling variables. We also describe the SmartSwapper algorithm, which uses information from the DeCoupler to simplify the solution path and parametrically iterate to a solution. The algorithms are logic based rather than numerically focused. The algorithms have been implemented into an equation solving software program (SmartSolve2) to demonstrate their effectiveness compared to other commercial strategies. It has been shown that these algorithms can solve nonlinear simultaneous equations without the need for highly refined initial guesses.

When test cases are allocated in proportion to the size of subdomains, partition testing strategies are provably better than random testing, in the sense of having a higher or equal probability of detecting at least one failure (the P-measure). Recently, the Generalised Proportional Sampling (GPS) strategy, which is always satisfiable, was proposed to relax the proportionality condition. The paper studies the use of approximation methods to generate test distributions satisfying the GPS strategy, and evaluates this proposal empirically. Our results are very encouraging, showing that on average about 98.72% to almost 100% of the test distributions obtained in this way are better than random testing in terms of the P-measure","","POD:0-7695-0509-0","10.1109/APSEC.1999.809655","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=809655","","Approximation methods;Computer science;Computer science education;Fault detection;Global Positioning System;Mathematics;Performance evaluation;Sampling methods;Software engineering;Software testing","probability;program testing;programming theory","GPS strategy;Generalised Proportional Sampling;P-measure;approximation methods;generalised proportional sampling strategy;partition testing strategies;proportionality condition;random testing;satisfiable;software testing;test distributions;unfavourable circumstances","","0","","12","","","","1999","07 Dec 1999-10 Dec 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceeding from familiar SM concepts, students rapidly grasp object orientation when OO concept evolution is traced to SM antecedents. Students are helped to distinguish OO approaches through the comparison of unique sequences of procedural steps which comprise methodology-derived development models (MDMs). When OO analysis, design and development are supported by CASE, the software must reify an MDM which is consistent with a familiar software life-cycle. Computer-based tutorials are needed to support student work with CASE. A generic set of OO concepts, derived from an exhaustive study of OO methodologies, is identified.

This paper presents the laboratory curriculum design, and the results of a multi-part assessment conducted beginning one year after implementation. Many students are initially surprised by the level of challenge provided in the first laboratory course, but readily accommodate as they progress through the sequence. A multifaceted assessment strategy has evolved which uses end-of-term student evaluations, retrospective student evaluations, student oral interviews, and faculty interviews. The assessment information is used to improve the laboratories through modification of the laboratory manuals, better instructions to graduate teaching assistants, modifications of experiments, and a purposeful effort to keep all faculty informed of laboratory course content so they can build upon the laboratory experience in classroom teaching. The overall result of the new laboratory experience is that students have a more integrated approach to design and a much better understanding of the hardware, software and instrumentation used in electrical engineering practice. In addition, students who complete the sequence have better oral and written communication skills, and are more confident in approaching job interviews and initial job challenges","0018-9359;00189359","","10.1109/13.848066","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=848066","","Computer vision;Design engineering;Education;Electrical engineering;Guidelines;Hardware;Instruments;Laboratories;Manuals;Metals industry","computer science education;computerised instrumentation;educational courses;electrical engineering education;laboratories;professional communication;student experiments","classroom teaching;computer engineering;curriculum assessment;curriculum design;electrical engineering;electrical engineering practice;initial job challenges;interdisciplinary core laboratory sequence;interdisciplinary laboratory sequence;job interviews;laboratory course;laboratory manuals;multifaceted assessment strategy;oral communication skills;students;teaching assistants;written communication skills","","21","","15","","","","May 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The goal of this course is to prepare students for software testing management, testing considerations, designing for testing, and exposure to these various methodologies. Various design techniques for product reliability, quality assurance, and applying various testing tools and methodologies are studied and applied in a classroom environment.

Existing video capture software provides the multimedia designer with the tools for creating effective video clips, if one knows how to use them properly. The paper presents a simple and effective process for creating digital movies suitable for educational use. Numerous parameters can serve to improve or harm the quality of the video.

This is particularly serious because, for most graduates in computing, software engineering will form the core of their professional practice.

In this paper, an augmentation to the traditional pedagogical strategy is presented for introducing students to normalization and relational synthesis concepts. This augmentation transforms semantic concepts into Boolean form that can be easily manipulated with the Karnaugh map. The Karnaugh map provides an especially useful method for illustrating the process of determining the candidate keys of a relation, as well as simplifying the mechanics of manipulating functional dependencies that are required for database decomposition and synthesis.

Proceedings","20020806","1999","","","95","104","Recently, the effectiveness of subdomain testing and random testing has been studied analytically. T.Y. Chen and Y.T. Yu (1994) found that, for the case of disjoint subdomains, as long as the number of test cases selected from each subdomain is proportional to its size (the proportional sampling strategy), the probability of revealing at least one failure using subdomain testing is not less than that using random testing. This paper investigates the effectiveness of the optimally refined proportional sampling (ORPS) strategy, which is a special case of the proportional sampling strategy. The ORPS strategy is simple in concept, and the implementation cost is usually low. An empirical study has been conducted for a sample of published programs with seeded errors. The performance of this strategy was found to be better than random testing","","POD:0-7695-0328-4","10.1109/STEP.1999.798483","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=798483","","Computer science;Continuing education;Councils;Radio access networks;Read only memory;Sampling methods;Software engineering;Statistical analysis;Testing;Vocational training","optimisation;probability;program testing;sampling methods","disjoint subdomains;failure detection probability;implementation cost;optimally refined proportional sampling testing strategy;partition testing;performance;program testing;random testing;seeded errors;subdomain testing;test case number","","0","","11","","","","1999","30 Aug 1999-02 Sep 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In 1991, Ryerson Polytechnic University initiated the “Discover Engineering” Summer Camp for high school girls. The objectives of the project are to educate young women about the challenges and rewards of engineering, and to motivate them to choose engineering as a career option. This paper presents an overview of the “Discover Engineering” project as an example of a successful recruitment strategy to attract more women into engineering. Follow-up surveys indicate that of the 760 students who have attended the camp, approximately 400 women are now studying engineering. Survey results and factors that contributed to the camp success are discussed. Camp attendance patterns and high school programs suggest that social class and cultural perceptions may still constitute barriers to women's entry into the engineering profession","0018-9359;00189359","","10.1109/13.804556","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=804556","","Computer aided software engineering;Educational institutions;Electrical engineering;Engineering education;Engineering profession;Genetics;Power engineering and energy;Power system control;Psychology;Recruitment","engineering education;gender issues;professional aspects","Canada;Discovering Engineering project;case study;engineering profession;recruitment strategy;undergraduate students;women in engineering","","1","","","","","","Nov 1999","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

TOOLS-Pacific 2000","20020806","2000","","","132","143","Object oriented technology has been established as an important new paradigm in software development. Thus, many organizations involved in any kind of software production plan to migrate to object oriented technology or have already started this process. Besides several successful migrations, many failures occur. In order to reduce the risk of failure during the migration process, we developed a migration model based on an empirical study. The application of this model leads to a better understanding of the migration process and supports its planning, designing and implementation, putting special emphasis on improvement of acceptance. The theoretical foundations of our migration model come from technology management, organizational research (i.e. change management, and organizational roles), as well as existing approaches and models for this kind of migration. Our migration model consists of three main parts: the migration process model, the definition of organizational roles, and the use of acceptance strategies such as information and communication, participation, and further education.

"Workshop — Developing active learning classroom exercises for use with Tablet PCs","J. G. Tront","Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech","2011 Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","20120202","2011","","","W1D-1","W1D-2","Tablet PCs use their inherent ability to accept electronic ink (e-ink) input to enable users to interact with the device in a more natural way. This is especially important in learning environments where the user needs to focus on subject material rather than on the device used to record or store the subject information. Using Tablet PCs, instructors are able to increase their effectiveness by making more dynamic presentations and by including active exercises into their classroom environments. Tablet PCs also facilitate better and more natural note-taking by students and easier after-class review of course material and notes. Further, Tablet PCs facilitate better interaction with persons participating in classroom sessions from remote locations since they easily involve students exchanging visual descriptions of concepts with the instructor and the rest of the class. Several software packages are available to support the pedagogical needs of the university classroom as well as typical group collaborative environments. Classroom Presenter, DyKnow, WriteOn and MS OneNote with the Interactive Classroom add-in are examples of some of the packages that provide excellent classroom capabilities. These packages allow for a highly interactive environment with both teacher-student and student-student bi-direction real-time interaction. See www.ee.vt.edu/∼jgtront/tabletpc/ to download tablet PC software. In this hands-on tutorial faculty will receive an introduction to the use of Classroom Presenter, OneNote, Interactive Classroom, VectorPad, and PDF Annotator. We will provide sufficient instruction for faculty to have a basic competency with the technology. Most importantly, we will show faculty various pedagogical practices that we have found helpful in using these technology tools in the classroom over the past seven years. Active learning exercises for various disciplines will be emphasized. Faculty will be tasked with developing short active learning exercises s- arting from the development of goals for the exercise, through the desired student interaction, and ending with the exercise assessment and improvement strategy. These active learning exercises will be targeted to students who are expected to be in the classroom as well as those who may be taking the course at extended campus locations. Exercises will be determined by the individual faculty member's disciplinary interests.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-61284-469-5; POD:978-1-61284-468-8; USB:978-1-61284-467-1","10.1109/FIE.2011.6143096","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6143096","Tablet PC;active learning;educational technology;electronic ink;electronic note-taking;slate computers;student engagement","","","","","0","","","","","","12-15 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
