"A Collaborative Learning System for Sharing 3D Models: 3D Model Co-learning Space","I. S. Lin; T. Y. Li; F. C. Liang; Y. T. Lin","Comput. Sci. Dept., Nat. Chengchi Univ., Taipei, Taiwan","2017 IEEE 17th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT)","20170807","2017","","","502","506","In the recent years, due to the prevalence of 3D printers, there have been many applications of 3D printing developed for education such as creating custom-made teaching aids or student art work. Although there are web sites hosting 3D models created by students and allowing them to share and search in the database, these systems usually lack functions of collaborative learning. On the other hand, most learning management systems do not provide functions needed for sharing and viewing 3D models. In this work, we aim to design a system called 3D Model Co-learning Space (3D MCLS), dedicated to collaborative learning allowing students to share 3D models as well as performing blind peer assessment. The system allows a user to store, share, display, and discuss 3D models and allows a teacher to manage a group of students in a flexible way. More specifically, the system can automatically create a thumbnail by computing an optimized view of an uploaded 3D model. It uses tags to organize models into groups according to their attributes or teams in a class for easier access through search. In addition, it can provide blind assignments of peer review and compare the results with self-assessment. We have implemented such a system and conducted a pilot study to obtain a preliminary evaluation on the usability of the system.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3870-5; POD:978-1-5386-3871-2","10.1109/ICALT.2017.102","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8001844","3D Model Co-learning Space;3D Printing;Collaborative Learning;Peer Assessment","Analytical models;Asia;Collaborative work;Conferences;Psychology;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays","computer aided instruction;graphical user interfaces;teaching;three-dimensional printing","3D MCLS;3D model co-leaning space;3D printing;blind peer assessment;collaborative learning system;peer review;self-assessment","","","","","","","","3-7 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our in vivo study examines how VEnvI can be used to teach fundamental computer science concepts such as sequences, loops, variables, conditionals, functions, and parallel programming. We aim to reach younger students through a fun and intuitive interface for choreographing dance movements with a virtual character. Our study contrasts the highly immersive and embodied virtual reality metaphor of using VEnvI with a non-immersive desktop metaphor. Additionally, we examine the effects of user attachment by comparing the learning results gained with customizable virtual characters in contrast with character presets. By analyzing qualitative and quantitative user responses measuring cognition, presence, usability, and satisfaction, we hope to find how virtual reality can enhance interest in the field of computer science among middle school students.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3419-2; POD:978-1-5090-3420-8","10.1109/RESPECT.2016.7836179","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7836179","","Computers;Education;Programming environments;Programming profession;Three-dimensional displays;Virtual reality","computer aided instruction;computer science education;entertainment;human computer interaction;humanities;parallel programming;teaching;virtual reality","VEnvI;cognition;computational thinking;computer science;dance choreography;embodied interaction;embodied virtual reality metaphor;entertainment application;immersive virtual reality metaphor;intuitive interface;middle school education;middle school students;movement choreography;nonimmersive desktop metaphor;parallel programming;teaching;usability;virtual character;virtual environment interactions;virtual peer customization;virtual programming environment;virtual reality education","","","","","","","","11-13 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Big data in healthcare: Prospects, challenges and resolutions","I. Olaronke; O. Oluwaseun","Department of Computer Science, Adeyemi College of Education, Ondo, Nigeria","2016 Future Technologies Conference (FTC)","20170119","2016","","","1152","1157","The healthcare system consists of large volumes of data which are usually generated from diverse sources such as physicians' case notes, hospital admission notes, discharge summaries, pharmacies, insurance companies, medical imaging, laboratories, sensor based devices, genomics, social media as well as articles in medical journals. Healthcare data are however very complex and difficult to manage. This is as a result of the astronomical growth of healthcare data, the high speed at which these data are generated as well as the diversity of data types in healthcare. The capturing, storage, analysis and retrieval of health related data are rapidly shifting from paper based system towards digitization. However, the vast volume as well as the complexity of these data makes it difficult for the data to be processed and analyzed by traditional approaches and techniques. Consequently, technologies such as cloud computing and virtualization are now gradually used for processing massive data effectively and securely in healthcare. Hence, the healthcare system is swiftly becoming a big data industry. Thus, this paper examines the concept of big data in healthcare, its benefits and attendant challenges. This paper revealed that the fragmentation of healthcare data, ethical issues, usability issues as well as security and privacy issues are some of the factors impeding the successful implementation of big data in healthcare. This paper therefore suggests that ensuring security and privacy of healthcare data, the adoption of a standardized healthcare terminology, education strategy and the design of usable systems for processing large volumes of data are some of the ways of successfully implementing big data in healthcare.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4171-8; POD:978-1-5090-4172-5","10.1109/FTC.2016.7821747","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7821747","big data;healthcare;information and communication technology","Big data;Biomedical imaging;Cloud computing;Databases;Google;Medical services;Security","Big Data;health care","Big Data;data complexity;data diversity;education strategy;healthcare data privacy;healthcare data security;healthcare system;standardized healthcare terminology","","","","","","","","6-7 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, studies indicate that due to the subjectivity of PBL concepts and the lack effective instruments for its implementation, the PBL teaching planning is compromised and strongly dependent on the teacher's ability. In addition, related studies indicate the existence of guidelines to support high level planning for the courses and disciplines in PBL such as infrastructure. Given that context, this paper proposes a tool for supporting PBL planning in Computing Education based on Backward Design Model that will lead teachers to structure their planning in order to comply with PBL processes and principles, maximizing the adherence of proposed activities to the PBL culture considering usability principles. The validation comprised the usability and acceptance evaluation of the tool proposed as well as its structure for conducting teachers planning their learning activities as much adherent as possible to PBL process and principles. The results analyzed indicate good usability scores and acceptance of the tool proposed through usability questionnaires as well as indicated the approach would assist in PBL educational planning process, supporting to maximize maturity in PBL.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1790-4; POD:978-1-5090-1791-1","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757386","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757386","Backward Design;Bloom's Taxonomy;Canvas Model;Computer Education;Problem-Based Learning;Teaching Plan","Computational modeling;Computers;Education;Informatics;Planning;Proposals;Usability","cognition;computer science education;educational computing;educational courses;human factors;planning;teaching","PBL educational planning process;PBL teaching planning;PBL-Tutor Canvas;backward design model;computing education;high level course planning;labor market;problem solving skills;problem-based learning method;tool acceptance;usability questionnaires;usability scores","","","","","","","","12-15 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are one of such advanced means to access educational material and resources anywhere/anytime in the world. Invention of cloud computing technology has opened many options for organizations and individual to share the educational resources among students. By adopting cloud computing organizations can save various recurring costs such as ICT hardware/software, licensing, storage space, backups, maintenance and human resources. Cloud computing enables teachers and students to access and approach the academic material ubiquitously through portable appliances (smart phones, tablets, IPAD's etc.). There are numerous public cloud applications (offerings) available for accessing educational resources in urban as well as rural vicinity. The Usability evaluation of these cloud-based services in a particular academic atmosphere is significant prior to their adoption. Moreover, this enables the stakeholders to make better decisions to adopt these contemporary services. In this paper we present the usability evaluation of public cloud applications across three universities in Pakistan from stakeholders' perspective i.e. (teachers and students).

This paper addresses the bidirectional coupling between a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) haptic feedback device and a general-purpose modelling and simulation environment. In particular, an open-source library is developed to couple the Force Dimension omega.7 haptic device with the 20-sim modelling and simulation environment. The presented coupling interface is also compatible with all the different haptic devices produced by Force Dimension. The proposed integrated haptic interface makes it possible to track the user's motion, detect collisions between the user-controlled probe and virtual objects, compute reaction forces in response to motion or contacts and exert an intuitive force feedback on the user. A real-time one-to-one correspondence between reality and virtual reality can be transparently created. This allows for a variety of possible applications. Stability issues, performance issues, design and virtual prototyping challenges can be addressed and investigated for research purposes. In addition, design and virtual prototyping are also of interest to industry. Realistic training environments can be developed for the user considering different possible operations and stressing the importance of usability and user experience. Experiments based on using haptics technology in the field of education can also be easily performed. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed coupling, a case study is presented.

From vocational schools, through basic education to higher education, the use of teaching aids based on information technologies is now a common practice. Today, more than making large computing solutions to support the activities of e-learning, it is important to focus on software specific solutions whose cost of production / implementation has a quick return. In this context the need emerged to move forward with a system to support teaching and learning of foreign languages to facilitate communication between teachers and students. It is on this issue that we present a proposal to develop a computing solution that enables students to develop the skills of reading and speaking foreign languages within the classroom context or outside the classroom. In this specific case we address the English language.

Multimodal and voice technology that enables speech-based information retrieval and input, using mobile phones or handheld computing devices is explained. Use of multimodal technology helps to overcome the limitations imposed by the small screen of mobile devices and their cumbersome data input capabilities. This technology could be especially valuable in engineering and science education. During field trips, students involved in field monitoring, testing, or other activities using instruments or testing equipment, often need to enter and request information on mobile devices hands-free and eyes-free.

Although many specimens are readily available, particularly in medicine and biology, demonstrations are commonly performed by showing these static specimens to medical or biological students. Interactive demonstrations can significantly impacts learning. An interactive system for visualizing 3D human organ models can fulfil this need. In this paper, we present techniques to realize such a system which can let the user select and view one or several major organ models extracted from segmented visible human dataset interactively through a simple graphical user interface. The stereoscopic views of these organ models are also achieved with this system running on a PC-based stereo-ready system. In our system, the marching cubes algorithm is used but new implementation we proposed to greatly improve both the speed and quality of surface rendering results is performed. This new implementation can generate the marching cubes cases on-the-fly within the surface extraction process of the models by considering the relationship of the vertices, borders, and surfaces of each voxel. We also describe a new method for specifying the normals for the extracted triangles without the need of physical information (such as intensity values stored in a medical computed tomography (CT) dataset) stored in the voxels. These normals will be used for lighting the extracted models later. Furthermore, a memory arrangement scheme is designed to enhance the usability of the system.","","POD:0-7695-2473-7","10.1109/CAD-CG.2005.21","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1604667","","Biological system modeling;Computed tomography;Data mining;Educational technology;Graphical user interfaces;Humans;Information technology;Interactive systems;Rendering (computer graphics);Visualization","computer aided instruction;data visualisation;graphical user interfaces;interactive systems;medical image processing","3D human organ model visualization;graphical user interface;interactive system;marching cubes algorithm;medical computed tomography;memory arrangement scheme;segmented visible human dataset;stereoscopic views;surface rendering","","1","","12","","","","7-10 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each of these two disciplines is now well represented with respect to most computer science (CS) curricula. However, the two disciplines are practiced almost independently - missing opportunities to collaborate, coordinate and communicate about the overall design - and thereby contributing to system failures. Today, a confluence of several ingredients contribute to these failures: the increasing importance of the user interface (UI) component in the overall system, the independent maturation of the human computer interaction area, and the lack of a cohesive process model to integrate the UI experts usability engineering (UE) development efforts with that of software engineering (SE). This in turn, we believe, is a result of a void in computing curricula: a lack of education and training regarding the importance of communication, collaboration and coordination between the SE and UE processes. In this paper we describe the current approach to teaching SE and UE and its shortcomings. We identify and analyze the barriers and issues involved in developing systems having substantial interactive components. We then propose four major themes of learning for a comprehensive computing curriculum integrating SE, UE, and system architectures in a project environment.","0190-5848;01905848","POD:0-7803-8552-7","10.1109/FIE.2004.1408713","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1408713","","Collaboration;Computer architecture;Computer science;Computer science education;Human computer interaction;Proposals;Software engineering;Software systems;Usability;User interfaces","computer science education;educational courses;human computer interaction;software engineering;user interfaces","HCI-SE curriculum;computer science curriculum;experts usability engineering;human computer interaction;software engineering;system failures;usability engineering;user interface","","0","","18","","","","20-23 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In UK academia, there is a chronic shortage of able candidates to fill posts at all levels, from research students (through research fellows and lecturers) to professors. It is clear from salaries being offered in industry that it is a “seller's market”. However, since thousands of students graduate each year in the UK with computing degrees, questions must be asked about the extent to which software engineering is addressed within these courses. It is impossible to consider software engineering curricula without giving acknowledgement to the impact of human factors, organisational issues and cultural norms. Therefore, in looking at software engineering education, I believe we need to devise syllabuses that not only address technical issues (such as the object-oriented paradigm, metrics or metaCASE technology) but also the “sociotechnical” concerns (such as the usability of systems and the requirement to engineer systems to situationally specific work practices). Identifying what should be taught is only part of the problem; the other part is how.

This paper analyzed the effectiveness and usability through a survey of university e-lectures and educational competitions using EDISON for better service improvement. In this survey six disciplines were chosen: computational fluid dynamics, nano-electronic device and general physics, computational chemistry, structural analysis, computer aided optimal design, computational bio-medicine. Interestingly, according to the results of the survey, users of each computational science field were already familiar with the user interfaces of the simulation tools they had used before EDISON, and hoped that EDISON would have similar one. In addition, although the effectiveness of learning has been improved through practice, it is difficult for first learners because of quantitative and qualitative shortage of user and theory manuals. Lastly, the most important factor was the lecturer's explanation to use the computational science platform and find the meaning of the simulation results. To sum up, back-ups which are documentation and lecturer's assistances should be accompanied outside simulation workflows. In the last stage, this study searched for ways to improve the quality through summarizing the requirements, and proposed the direction of EDISON in the future.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2686-3; POD:978-1-5386-2687-0","10.1109/eScience.2017.74","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8109179","EDISON;e-lectures;educational competitions;educational disciplines;web-based computational science platform","Computational modeling;Education;Manuals;Portals;Scientific computing;Tools;User interfaces","","","","","","","","","","24-27 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, little is known about the effects of using e-textbooks on students' learning outcomes and the educational affordance of e-textbooks. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of using an e-textbook on Hong Kong students' learning of chemistry in secondary school. An e-textbook chapter entitled Ions, Ionic bonding and Structure was developed. A checklist was constructed to evaluate the quality of the curriculum and the technical features of the electronic chapter. A pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design was used in this study. Two groups of secondary-4 students (N = 27) from two Hong Kong schools participated; the experimental group used the e-textbook chapter while the comparison group used a traditional chemistry textbook published in Hong Kong to have lessons. After the intervention, the students took a posttest to assess their chemistry achievement and responded to a questionnaire to assess their attitudes towards the e-textbook. A performance test was administered to assess students' psychomotor skills at constructing ionic models. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted to collect teacher and student views about using e-textbook in a chemistry classroom. Results showed that the students in the experimental group performed better than their counterparts in the comparison group in terms of chemistry achievement, but no significant difference was found in the psychomotor domain. Using the newly constructed checklist, both teachers evaluated the e-textbook as good for learning. Both teachers and most of the participating students have positive evaluation of the e-textbook in the semi-structured interviews. However, the teacher and students expressed some concerns about using the e-textbook in their regular chemistry lessons, such as classroom management and distractions. The trial e-text- ook chapter was perceived as useful with various educational affordances and the students who used e-textbooks in the study were more likely to study. The significance and implications of these findings for chemistry education in Hong Kong are discussed.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-0892-0; POD:978-1-5386-0893-7","10.1109/LaTiCE.2017.17","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8064432","chemistry;curriculum evaluation;e-textbook;educational affordance;working memory overload","Bonding;Chemistry;Education;Interviews;Ions;Multimedia communication;Usability","chemistry computing;computer aided instruction;educational institutions;electronic publishing;human computer interaction","Hong Kong schools;chemistry classroom;chemistry education;e-textbook chapter;educational affordance;electronic textbooks;secondary school;students learning outcomes","","","","","","","","20-23 April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such courses include Software Life Cycle phases like Requirement gathering/ analysis, Design, Implementation and Testing but not UX design. Thus best of the project fail to generate a product that is usable. This paper presents a case study of minor project course which incorporated UX design in building mobile apps. UX is new technology and little known to instructors at colleges. So students were instructed to learn UX from MOOC on 'UX Design for Mobile Developer's', hosted by Udacity. Also, a workshop by industry expert in UX was conducted. The UX activities specified by MOOC were included as part course assessments. Through the UX design, students identified 3 to 4 user/ mobile device requirements and incorporated them in the implementation. The weightage of marks for UX design is 24%, which increased Design phase weightage to 30%. Finally students were able to launch product, 'KLE Tech STUDio' mobile-app. Attainment of design phase, UX, activities specified by MOOC, implementations are 7.2, 7.82, 6.8 and 7.5 respectively on the scale of 10.

Watermarking has been proved as a right-protection mechanism that can provide detectable evidence for the legal ownership of a shared dataset, without compromising its usability. However, the main disadvantage of these conventional techniques is unintelligent, rule-based and they do not directly deal with the data synchronization. Therefore, decoding performance reduces significantly when the watermarked data is transmitted through a real communication channel. This paper proposes an intelligent learning-based watermark scheme for outsourced biomedical time series data. The scheme carries out embedding of watermark data based on modifying mean modulation relationship of approximation coefficients in wavelet domain. In addition, the correlation between modified frequency coefficients and the watermark sequence in wavelet domain is intelligently learnt by a machine learning algorithm. The watermark can be effectively retrieved using this learning algorithm. Experimental results on electroencephalography (EEG) data with support vector data description (SVDD) learning show that the proposed scheme provides good imperceptibility and more robust against various signal processing techniques and common attacks such as random cropping, noise addition, low-pass filtering, and resampling.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6182-2; POD:978-1-5090-6183-9","10.1109/IJCNN.2017.7966414","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7966414","","Data mining;Databases;Discrete wavelet transforms;Electrocardiography;Electroencephalography;Time series analysis;Watermarking","approximation theory;data protection;electroencephalography;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;outsourcing;support vector machines;time series;watermarking;wavelet transforms","EEG data;SVDD;approximation coefficients;communication channel;data mining;data synchronization;decoding performance;electroencephalography data;healthcare fields;intelligent learning-based watermarking scheme;machine learning algorithm;mean modulation relationship;modified frequency coefficients;outsourced biomedical time series data;right-protection mechanism;signal processing techniques;support vector data description;watermark sequence;wavelet domain","","","","","","","","14-19 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A possible solution is to design sound technology-enhanced learning (TEL) environments with relevant content and pedagogical tools to reduce teachers' design efforts. Technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) is a promising framework for understanding how teachers could integrate technologies into classrooms. Scholars have highlighted the “repurposing” of the framework to inform the design of TEL environments. This study employed the TPACK framework to design the learning environment called `MyCLOUD'. MyCLOUD advances the integration of mobile and cloud technologies for self-directed, collaborative and seamless Chinese Language learning among primary students. In this paper, we unpack how the distributed TPACK resources among the teachers and the researchers have contributed to the design of the learning environment.

In this paper, in order to facilitate real-world social interaction, we aim to predict “serendipitous” social interactions, which are defined as unplanned encounters and interaction opportunities and regarded as emerging social interactions. We collected GPS trajectory data from people' daily life on campus and use it as empirical mobility traces to generate decision trees and model trees to predict next venues, arrival times, and user encounter. Mobility regularities are mainly considered in these prediction models, and mobility contexts (e.g., time, location, and speed) act as decision nodes in the classification trees. Experimental results using collected GPS data showed that our system achieves 90% accuracy for predicting a user's next venue using a decision tree algorithm, with minute-level (around 5 min) prediction error for arrival time using the model tree algorithm. Two prototype applications were developed to support serendipitous social interaction on campus, and the feedback from a user study with 25 users demonstrated the usability of these two applications.","2168-2291;21682291","","10.1109/THMS.2015.2451515","National Basic Research Program of China; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; 10.13039/100004318 - Microsoft; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160746","GPS data;inference model;mobility prediction;serendipitous social interaction;user study","Accuracy;Global Positioning System;Inference mechanisms;Predictive models;Social implications of technology;Trajectory","decision trees;mobile computing;pattern classification;social sciences computing","GPS trajectory data;arrival time prediction;classification trees;decision tree generation;human mobility prediction;next venue prediction;serendipitous social interaction prediction;social interaction opportunity forecasting;user encounter prediction","","5","","33","","","20150716","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents a generic and extendable telematics infrastructure offering flexible and mobile telemedicine for patients. More and more sensors and medical actuators are available as commercial “off-the-shelf” (COTS) devices including personal area communication technologies. The presented system integrates these devices into a distributed network to provide medical care at remote locations. The system is designed to support mobile patients in their daily life and to provide real-time access and remote control in critical situations. Therefore, the combination of different communication types is introduced to meet all requirements. As part of the telemedical system, a Tele-Service-Center with an automated data analysis is integrated into the infrastructure to support the treatment of the patients. Altogether, this system offers the opportunity for improving the medical treatment of the patient while simultaneously reducing the costs. The presented system was implemented and tested in a case study with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients.

The training is conventionally performed on rubber mannequins albeit practical limitations. Computer simulation with haptic feedback can potentially offer a more realistic and accessible training method. However, the complex interactions between the tube and the nasogastric passage make it difficult to model the haptic feedback during NGT placement. In this paper, a fuzzy-logic-based approach is proposed to directly transfer the experience of clinicians in NGT placement into the simulation system. Based on their perception of the varying tactile sensation and the conditions during NGT placement, the membership functions and fuzzy rules are defined to develop the force model. Forces created using the model are then combined with friction forces to drive the haptic device and render the insertion forces in real time. A prototype simulator is developed based on the proposed force model and the implementation details are presented. The usability of the prototype is also evaluated by clinical teachers. The proposed methodology has the potential for developing computerized NGT placement training methods for clinical education. It is also applicable for simulation systems involving complicated force interactions or computation-expensive models.","1939-1412;19391412","","10.1109/TOH.2016.2550044","Outstanding Youth Fund of the Jiangsu Province; Polytechnic University; Scholarship of Centre for Smart Health; 10.13039/100005228 - SAR; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7448448","Fuzzy logic;force modeling;haptic rendering;nasogastric tube intubation","Computational modeling;Electron tubes;Finite element analysis;Force;Haptic interfaces;Real-time systems;Training","feedback;fuzzy logic;medical computing","clinical education;clinical teachers;complex interactions;complicated force interactions;computation-expensive models;computer simulation;computerized NGT placement;friction forces;fuzzy rules;fuzzy-logic-based approach;haptic device;haptic feedback;haptic simulation;heuristic force model;insertion forces;nasogastric passage;nasogastric tube insertion;prototype simulator;realistic training method;rubber mannequins albeit practical limitations;tactile sensation;training methods","","","","","","","20160406","July-Sept. 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, this study uses visual programming language as a basis, i.e. Scratch 2.0 offline edition, to introduce abstraction of mathematics operations. Scratch 2.0 can empower learners using graphical elements to solve mathematics problems with a smooth learning curve through user-friendly programming interface. However, the latest version of Scratch 2.0 does not include enough functions for abstracting mathematical blocks.

This increase in aging population has drawn global interest to aging issues. However, despite active research on this issue, the following problems remain. Firstly, research on ways to familiarize senior citizens with smart devices is lacking. Secondly, research on consumption of digital contents among senior citizens using smart devices is also lacking. For senior citizens to utilize and get the best of smart devices and digital contents, focus must be placed on usability and their familiarity with smart devices.

Text font was limited related to the size of classroom. Steps of drawing the coordinate systems were not clear when it was only explained in one slide without any animations. By developing this topic in interactive multimedia, the teaching method can be improved using one of existing e-learning system in our university, called eLisa, which is not limited by time, distance, and also can overcome those mentioned problems due to this simple and clear visualization of Cartesian, Cylindrical, and Spherical Coordinate Systems. This research is conducted to investigate the benefit of the developed multimedia to improve knowledge of students about the topic. This investigation used t-test to find the significance improvement of learning the topics using this interactive multimedia by doing a hands on quiz and walkthru method to find the multimedia in eLisa.

Good visual-spatial ability is needed to mentally transform or fuse multiple images that are required to understand a concept. While animations and videos are developed for anatomy learning, the presentation of 3D anatomical objects on 2D planar computer screen does not render the depth perception necessary for intuitive understanding of the spatial details and subtlety. To enhance anatomy education, a stereoscopic 3D visualization system is proposed in this paper. Depth perception is naturally rendered using active stereo technology to create an immersive learning environment which allows students to directly interact with and explore the virtual anatomical objects. In addition to translation, rotation, zooming in and out, the body parts are modeled as multi-layer objects so that the outer layers can be set to semi-transparent to expose the inner layers, while the associations between the inner and outer layers can also be depicted. A pilot study is conducted to evaluate the system usability and user interface of the proposed stereoscopic 3D visualization system. The response of the 14 healthcare students who participate in the study is positive. They appreciate the intuitiveness and flexibility offered by the system, which can facilitate anatomy learning.

HDR involves forming hypotheses, designing experiments to test the hypotheses, predicting the outcomes of the experiments, conducting the experiments to observe the outcomes and comparing the predicted and observed outcomes. HDR skill is important for core practices in science such as providing causal explanation for any phenomenon, designing of experiments and accepting or rejecting hypotheses. Few efforts have been made at the college level, especially in the context of biology, to develop HDR in learners. In order to address this gap, we have designed and developed a learning environment, Geneticus Investigatio (GI), to help improve learners' HDR skills in the context of Mendelian genetics. Affordances of technology enhanced learning environments such as agent-based modeling system have been used in the design of GI leveraging functionalities like variable manipulation, system-generated feedback and personalized practice which help learners develop this reasoning. In this paper, we report the theoretical basis, design and development of GI and a preliminary study on learners' perceptions about usability and learning from GI.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6115-0; POD:978-1-5090-6116-7","10.1109/T4E.2016.042","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7814817","Agent based modeling;Geneticus investigatio;Hypothetico-Deductive Reasoning;Mendelian genetics;Model based reasoning;Technology Enhanced Learning Environment","Biological system modeling;Cognition;Computational modeling;Context;Genetics;Usability","biology computing;computer aided instruction;educational institutions;genetics;inference mechanisms","GI;Geneticus investigatio;Mendelian genetics;agent-based modeling system;biology education;college level;learner HDR skills improvement;system-generated feedback;teaching-learning hypothetico-deductive reasoning;technology enhanced learning environments;undergraduate level;variable manipulation","","","","","","","","2-4 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Imitation learning is relatively cheap in terms of time and labor and is a promising route to give robots the necessary functionalities for a widespread use in households, stores, hospitals, etc. However, current imitation learning techniques struggle with a number of challenges that prevent their wide usability. For instance, robots might not be able to accurately reproduce every human demonstration and it is not always clear how robots should generalize a movement to new contexts. This paper addresses those challenges by presenting a method to incrementally teach context-dependent motor skills to robots. The human demonstrates trajectories for different contexts by moving the links of the robot and partially or fully refines those trajectories by disturbing the movements of the robot while it executes the behavior it has learned so far. A joint probability distribution over trajectories and contexts can then be built based on those demonstrations and refinements. Given a new context, the robot computes the most probable trajectory, which can also be refined by the human. The joint probability distribution is incrementally updated with the refined trajectories. We have evaluated our method with experiments in which an elastically actuated robot arm with four degrees of freedom learns how to reach a ball at different positions.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4718-5; POD:978-1-5090-4719-2; USB:978-1-5090-4717-8","10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2016.7803300","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7803300","","Context;Education;Hidden Markov models;Humanoid robots;Manipulators;Trajectory","human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulators;mobile robots;probability;robot programming","context-dependent motor skills;hand coding;human demonstrations;incremental imitation learning;joint probability distribution;motor skill teaching;robot arm;robots","","","","","","","","15-17 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Diagnostic assessment assists teachers in setting task-specific plans and goals, for both individual students, and the learner-group as a whole. In this paper, we describe Treasure Explorers, a Game With a Purpose (GWAP) with a multilayered structure that facilitates the learning process, promotes user retention, and is designed to reward contributing players. A comprehensive evaluation based on game log and TAM model was conducted. The log of over 5,500 records reveals that aspects of engagement and learning had occurred, and qualitative evaluations show the applicability and usability of games as diagnostic assessment tools.

"Gradual structuring: Evolving the spreadsheet paradigm for expressiveness and learnability","G. Miller; F. Hermans; R. Braun","School of Computing and Communications, University of Technology Sydney","2016 15th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training (ITHET)","20161201","2016","","","1","8","Spreadsheets are arguably the most used form of programming and are frequently used in higher education to teach fundamental concepts about computation. Their success has shown that they are simple enough for a huge number of end users to learn and use. This is in contrast to traditional programming languages and the high dropout rate from introductory programming and computer science. However in comparison to traditional programming languages and structured modelling, spreadsheets are not expressive, placing a limit on the levels of computational thinking that can be taught using the spreadsheet paradigm. This limitation is imposed by the lack of programming language features and abstractions in the paradigm. Furthermore, more advanced spreadsheet features (e.g. array formulae, lookup formulae, R1C1 syntax) can be difficult to learn and use. This paper discusses the idea of adding language features to spreadsheets, enabling the gradual structuring of free-form spreadsheets to more structured models. We propose that this concept is termed Gradual Structuring, and is analogous to the programming language concept of gradual typing. In this analogy, spreadsheets take the place of dynamic programming and structured modelling of static programming. In programming languages, gradual typing allows dynamic programming to be mixed with static programming. It is our contention that dynamic programming is more learnable while static programming is more expressive and abstract. Gradual typing could be used to mitigate the issues in the teaching of traditional programming. Likewise Gradual Structuring can mitigate the conceptual limits that can be taught using current spreadsheets. The key language feature required to enable Gradual Structuring is the ability to logically group cells together so that a single formula can be applied to the grouped cells. This concept, termed cell grouping diminishes and can even eliminate the need for the ubiquitous and error-prone use of copy-p- sted in spreadsheets. Moreover, it makes the structure present in spreadsheet models explicit. Cell grouping requires a cascade of other new languages features. Namely a more expressive referencing style, which in turned requires enabling labels to be moved to the row and column headers, and the hierarchical structuring of these headers. Respectively these language features are termed enhanced referencing and semantic axes. The ongoing research focusses on the usability and learnability of these language features. Spreadsheet applications exist that contain aspects of the features mentioned. However these applications do not enable Gradual Structuring and have taken a mainly technical, not human behavioural, approach to evolving the spreadsheet.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0778-3; POD:978-1-5090-0779-0; USB:978-1-5090-0777-6","10.1109/ITHET.2016.7760759","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7760759","","Computer languages;Dynamic programming;Education;Electronic mail;Programming profession;Semantics","computer aided instruction;computer science education;further education;programming languages;spreadsheet programs;teaching","R1C1 syntax;array formulae;cell grouping;computation;computer science;dynamic programming;free-form spreadsheets;gradual structuring;gradual typing;higher education;introductory programming;language features;learnability;lookup formulae;programming languages;semantic axes;static programming;structured modelling;teaching;usability","","","","","","","","8-10 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This study presents a mobile serious game proposal, called “Protecting the Earth”, about selective waste collection, recycling, reduction of waste production and waste reuse in different game stages with focuses in childish public. The methodology adopted included Systematic Review; application of Participatory Design methods, such as the Context Inquiry technique; specification of functional and non-functional requirements and the study of technologies appropriate for developing the project. Experiments were conducted with children aiming to assess the proposed tool's interface. The results obtained by means of usability testing with users showed the need for adjustments in the interface in order to achieve greater accessibility and user satisfaction, and were met immediately.

Research studies have shown that assessment methods also influence students' learning. Current assessment techniques, even those which include technology, focus more on summative assessment rather than formative. Formative assessment is necessary for teaching and assessment of complex skills like troubleshooting or network design. Therefore, there exists a need for assessments to capture students' problem solving process and chosen approaches during the assessment. By tracking a student's behaviors in an immersive assessment environment, the path that the student takes towards the solution can be studied. Virtual Worlds are naturally immersive environments and can be effectively used to record interactions that students made in the worlds. We have developed NetWorld in Open Wonderland, an open source software for creating 3D virtual worlds. NetWorld is a 3D virtual world built for detailed assessment of computer network concepts for computer science undergraduate students. This detailed assessment happens at 3 levels -- conceptual understanding, diagnostic abilities and the ability to design a network.

However, designing, developing, and deploying adaptive and mobile-oriented user interfaces for existing process engines are non-trivial, and require significant systematic efforts. To address this issue, we present a novel middleware-based approach, called MUIT, to developing and deploying the Mobility, User Interactions and Tasks into WS-BPEL engines. MUIT provides a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that provides some intuitive facilities to support the declarative development of adaptive, mobile-oriented, and Web-based user interfaces in WS-BPEL. The DSL can significantly reduce developers’ manual efforts of developing user interactions by preventing arbitrarily mixed code, and its runtime supports satisfactory user experiences. Additionally, MUIT can be seamlessly integrated into WS-BPEL without intrusions of existing process instances. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype by integrating MUIT into the commodity WS-BPEL-based Apusic Platform, and evaluate the performance and usability of MUIT platform.","1939-1374;19391374","","10.1109/TSC.2016.2633535","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7762930","WS-BPEL;human tasks;mobile;web programming","Business;DSL;Engines;Mobile communication;Smart phones;User interfaces","","","","","","","","","20161201","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Within this scenario, a practical and dynamic learning system is being fostered that allows simulations to be carried out in real contexts through problem resolution. Based on constructivist theories, PBL (Problem-Based Learning) is a teaching method that is focused on the students and its main characteristic is that it uses real-world problems to create the learning content and teach the skills required for their solution. However, the adoption of this approach is not an easy task, since it is accompanied by abrupt changes in the traditional paradigm of education, which require changes in the attitudes of the actors involved. In addition, the planning and monitoring of the PBL, involve complex activities that are difficult to manage, especially with regard to determining the quality and compliance of the processes used for problem resolution. Additionally, the Computer Science courses require working on projects provided by real clients, within a dynamic and iterative development process. This strengthens the need to introduce strategies and technologies to support the implementation and management of the method and, enable its effectiveness to be monitored In addition, it provides continuous feedback, and assesses the results generated from the evaluation of the solutions produced during the teaching-learning process. Thus, it is essential to adopt strategies that allow a better management of teaching practice, improved learning by the students and a means of validating the clients involved. From this perspective, this paper presents a virtual teaching and learning environment, called PBLMaestro, which has been designed to support the workflow of a methodology for the implementation of PBL in teaching Computer Science, called xPBL. With the aid of xPBL, it is possible to perform the management of courses using the dy- amics of a cycle and series of stages to allow a better control of management processes, by linking real problems to well-defined educational goals. In the case of teacher planning, we were used elements described in xPBL methodology, aligned with educational goals defined from the Bloom Revised Taxonomy. With regard to student tracking, we used the authentic assessment model and mechanisms of Learning Analytics. Gamification strategies were included to increase engagement, retention and motivation, and push notification messages were displayed in a mobile application the PBLMaestro was validated by means of application the environment in the context of the discipline “Network Design” of Computer Science Course, and the results are analyzed in this study. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the teachers and there was a high degree of satisfaction among the tutors, students and customers who used the service, with regard to the usability and consistency of the proposed environment as well as with its improvements and changes. Although the environment was improved in the area of computer science, it is possible that it can provide support to the STEM context with some customizations.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1790-4; POD:978-1-5090-1791-1","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757388","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757388","Computer Science;Gamification;PBLMaestro;Problem-Based Learning;Virtual Learning Environment","Collaboration;Computational modeling;Computer science;Context;Education;Monitoring;Planning","STEM;computer aided instruction;computer science education;data analysis;educational courses;serious games (computing)","Bloom revised taxonomy;PBLMaestro;STEM context;business corporations;computer education;computer science course;computer science courses;continuous feedback;dynamic learning system;educational goals;educational model;gamification strategies;iterative development process;learning analytics;learning content;market practices;network design;problem resolution;problem-based learning approach;teaching method;teaching-learning process;virtual learning environment;virtual teaching;xPBL","","","","","","","","12-15 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper examines the feasibility and the students' acceptability of the newly developed IT peer evaluation system. In implementing the system, three research questions were posed: 1. Does the new system facilitate classroom management? 2. Is the new system more accepted than the existing paper-based method by the students? 3. Does the new system promote the overall improvement of students' presentation skills? The preliminary results showed that the new system facilitated classroom management, and that it was accepted by the students primarily due to its functional requirement such as utility and non-functional requirement such as promptness. Furthermore, the students' average numerical peer evaluation scores of physical messages and audience interaction mostly improved.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1790-4; POD:978-1-5090-1791-1","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757542","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757542","classroom support system;peer evaluation;presentation skills","Engineering profession;Engineering students;Reflection;Smart phones;Usability;Visualization","STEM;computer aided instruction;mobile learning;technical presentation;video streaming","IT peer evaluation system;Japanese engineering students;STEM;classroom management;communication skills;global engineering community;mobile-friendly classroom support system;paper-based method;sophomore science technology engineering and mathematics;students presentation skills;video streaming","","","","","","","","12-15 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Games provide a key medium through which this may be achieved, though limited evidence exists as regards the best techniques, both pedagogical and technological, by which data can be translated to engaging and educational material. In this paper, we describe the approach adopted by a serious game supporting the development of healthy lifestyles amongst adolescents. The game itself places the player as a survivor in a post-apocalyptic scenario, tasked with survival and exploration. Utilising the United States Department of Agriculture's open data on nutritional information, four different mini-games are implemented in the form of two quiz-based approaches, a puzzle, and a system directly connected to wider game mechanics as a “crafting” system. We discuss the design rationale behind these games and their differences, and present the outcomes of usability testing showing some insight into the various techniques.

The result analysis and testing of experiment are done in the sense to get best quality of QR Code though the information embedded should not affected and the QR Code must easily be decoded the embedded information from common tools. The goal of this research paper is to explore and analyze the best image under the testing of Error Correction Level and Matrix Point Size parameters by calculating the PSNR and MSE values for QR Code images with different image file format (PNG and JPG). The calculated values are compared and the final conclusion of the work found which state that the PNG image with Error Correction Level-L and Matrix Point Size 1 are the best to generate quality QR Code. The testing and result are presented which state that the QR Code is the best way to compose the identical information of any entity to quickly figure out the originality.","","","10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732198","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7732198","2-D BAR Code;Digital;Error Correction Level;QR Code;URL","Authentication;Cryptography;Education;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Uniform resource locators","QR codes;document image processing;educational technology;error correction codes;image coding;mean square error methods;security of data","JPG;MSE values;PNG;PSNR;QR code images;QR code technology;QRC;URL embedding;Web environment;bar code;digital authentication;digital decoding technique;digital education system;digital encoding technique;digital security;duplicity;educational document;error correction level;image file format;matrix point size parameters;programming logics;quick response code","","","","","","","","21-24 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Testing and validating a conceptual framework for e-collaboration in an undergraduate course","A. S. Yussiff; W. F. W. Ahmad; E. E.

However, despite the progress registered in the use of e-collaboration system as educational tools through the incorporation of constructivism learning theories and its related didactics in higher educational institution, the approach has not yet been successfully transferred to the classroom. More importantly, there are still misconceptions among researchers regarding students achieving authentic learning from online interaction and collaboration. In an attempt to close this gap, a framework was developed to assist in the design, development and implementation of e-collaboration in a higher education institution. The framework addresses the development process of e-collaboration content, approaches for e-collaboration, pedagogical didactics, learning theories, and roles of users in e-collaboration. In an attempt to validate the framework, an e-collaboration system named `Teach, Learn, and Research E-collaboration System' (TELERECS), was developed and experimentally implemented in a classroom context. An experimental research design based on control and experimental groups, pre/post-test and usability survey were used to validate the framework. The results revealed that there is significant difference between the post-test mean scores of the experimental and control groups. In addition, there is moderate, positive monotonic correlation between easy to use and post-test-scores; and between useful for team work and post-test-score for the experimental group. These imply that the framework offers a promising basis for meaningful learning. Future work includes a further exploration and validation of the framework and comparing results.","","","10.1109/ISMSC.2015.7594061","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7594061","Conceptual Framework;E-collaboration;Evaluation;Validation;experimental design;posttests;pretest","Collaboration;Electronic publishing;Information services;Instruments;Internet;Team working;Usability","Internet;computer aided instruction;distance learning;educational courses;further education;groupware","Internet;TELERECS;classroom context;conceptual framework;constructivism learning theory;educational tool;electronic collaboration;higher educational institution;monotonic correlation;online interaction;pedagogical didactics;teach-learn-and research e-collaboration system;undergraduate course","","","","","","","","19-20 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A patient with a chronic disease is surrounded by several health professionals who use their own technical language, which impedes the interdisciplinary exchange of information between specialists and from the caregiver to the patient. In order to enhance the TPE, we have developed a Web-based application that permits a customized and strategic evaluation of neuromuscular deficiencies as a whole. This project's main challenge is to construct a tool which is accessible for ordinary people but still maintains useful information for professionals.

The main concept behind this project is to setup the interface for rapid interaction design. Eye tracking is a powerful tool for hands free communication but for that requires a dedicated software. This software is rarely tailored for a specific needs of a potential user. It means that people who wants to explore gaze driven computer interfaces often need to create their own eye tracking software or need to have certain computer skills to be able to go through the software development kit (SDK) provided by the eye tracker vendors. It makes designing interaction by gaze quite challenging. The eGlasses eye tracking module was used to extend sensor values available in Scratch by the information about pupil position, gaze position and eye opened/eye closed signal. In this paper we have tested if the gaze data acquired by the eGlasses are reliable and can be used as an input signal for rapid interaction design using Scratch. The whole interface was validated regarding the system usability score (SUS). The purpose of our work is to support disabled children and their therapists but also to give a chance to a wider community, without computational skills, to easily check they ideas for gaze based interaction. The results of conducted studies with the participation of volunteers give strong foundations to support this statement.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1729-4; POD:978-1-5090-1730-0","10.1109/HSI.2016.7529675","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7529675","Scratch;eGlasses;education;eye tracking;interaction design;smart glasses","Calibration;Cameras;Computers;Gaze tracking;Microdisplays;Usability","gaze tracking;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;software engineering;visual programming","SDK;Scratch programming tool;computer skills learning;dedicated software;eGlasses;eye opened/eye closed signal;eye tracking module;gaze position;pupil position;software development kit;visual programming language","","","","","","","","6-8 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we investigate the intellectual recommender system on cell phones by incorporating mobile data analysis. Nowadays with the development of smart phones, more and more applications have emerged on various areas, such as entertainment, education and health care. While these applications have brought great convenience to people's daily life, they also provide tremendous opportunities for analyzing users' interests. In this work we develop an Android background service to collect the user behaviors and analyze their preferences based on their Android application usage. As one of the most intuitive media for visual representation, videos with various types of contents are recommended to users based on a proposed graphical model. The proposed model jointly utilizes the textual descriptions of Android applications and videos, as well as the extracted video content based features.

Since most of our human activity could potentially have big environmental impacts once accumulated, it is especially important that the public is educated with the environmental effects of their daily actions. This paper's main purpose is to propose a gamified system that leverages the high saturation of smartphones and the rising popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) to educate young children with environmental concepts as well as encouraging them to commit to real-life ""green habits"". An android mobile game Eco Eco was developed to demonstrate the concept and test the proposed system's effectiveness for young users. This Farmville-like game is played only by conducting real-life environmental activities like using a reusable water bottle, walking more steps instead of using cars, or reduce usage of household electricity. The game, developed with Unity3D utilizes the Google Fit API for step count, CloudSight API for image recognition and a connected smart device for monitoring energy usage. A preliminary user test was also conducted to improve the usability of the system as well as to test the effects of this system.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9175-7; POD:978-1-4673-9176-4","10.1109/HAVE.2015.7359476","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7359476","Serious Games;haptic communication system;smartphone;technology for visually impaired","Games;Image recognition;Legged locomotion;Sea level;Sea measurements;Sensors;Visualization","Internet of Things;climate mitigation;computer aided instruction;environmental factors;environmental science computing;mobile computing;serious games (computing);smart phones","Android mobile game Eco Eco;CloudSight API;Farmville-like game;Global climate change;Google Fit API;Internet of Things;IoT;Unity3D;cellphone-based videogames;climate related behaviors;environmental concepts;environmental effects;gamified system;household electricity usage reduction;human activity;preliminary user test;real-life environmental activities like;real-life green habits;reusable water bottle;smartphones;young children education","","","","4","","","","11-11 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We conducted an empirical study on the use of natural language for computation, and found that, although it provides support for understanding computational concepts, it introduces additional difficulties when used for coding. Following a design study with target users, we distilled our findings into a series of design guidelines for novice programming environments that incorporate natural language. These guidelines drove the design of Flip, a bimodal programming language for young people's game creation activities. Two empirical studies examined the extent to which these embodied design guidelines support ease of use and an understanding of computation.

In this paper, the emphasis is on human characteristics, rather than on the formal properties of programming and modeling languages. Do the involved computing practitioners refer to the same concepts when they use the same words? A preliminary version of this study [1] addressed the assessment of differences in mental representations of abstract entities involved in programming and modeling. In this extended version we report the results of an experiment, designed to compare mental representations of abstract concepts with mental models described in the literature.

This method consists in applying game concepts, mechanics and aesthetics in non-gaming applications, aiming to improve a person or group's engagement and commitment to perform a task. These concepts can range from extrinsic motivators as points, levels, leaderboards and achievements, to intrinsic ones as competition, cooperation, sense of achievement and decision making. It also have been proved that these concepts also aids in the construction and improvement of cognitive, social and emotional behaviour of a person or group. Based on the previous work of developing an online learning environment to aid in Math Lessons on basic education, this paper presents the evaluation of a Gamified Online System (SiGMa) focused on Math problems solving. The application contains a module that randomizes the values of the users' selected problems, which are divided in three areas (Arithmetic, Combinatorics and Geometry) in order to make them memorize the logic rather than answers when solving Math based questions. The system was also implemented with Gamification concepts to improve the engagement of students. The tests were applied with a group of 30 Math teachers that were exposed to the system for 3 consecutive months. Those professionals evaluated the usability and pedagogical properties of the Gamification concepts implemented within the application as: problem solving, correct classification, difficulty, context, engagement, reflection, support, interaction, visual interface, information, error recovery, message exchange. The tests also evaluated the relevance of each one of the implemented gamification concepts as: goals, rewards, points, levels, progress, time pressure, achievements, leaderboards, chances, renewal and relevant statistical information. The tests achieved positive results, above the average stipulated by the authors in the evaluation. The paper also pres- nt the preliminary tests that were made with a group of selected students, in order to test the systems' efficiency.","","Paper:978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344073","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344073","","Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Databases;Education;Games;Problem-solving;Visualization","arithmetic;combinatorial mathematics;computer aided instruction;computer games;geometry;mathematics computing;teaching","Math problem solving;Math teachers;SiGMa evaluation;arithmetic;combinatorics;game concepts;gamification;gamified online system;geometry;online learning environment","","","","19","","","","21-24 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Students learn more with less text that covers the same core topics","A. Edgcomb; F. Vahid; R. Lysecky","Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside, Riverside, CA, USA","2015 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","20151207","2015","","","1","5","For textbooks on technical topics, the typical amount of text used is more than what many college students will read. Some teachers observe, and students report, that students commonly skim such text. As such, a writing style that aggressively minimizes text while still teaching the core technical topic may improve student learning; if text is short enough, students may then read and study the text more carefully. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of text quantity on amount learned. We created and compared content styles using a lesson that taught Google search techniques. The two main content styles were normal text and minimal text. The normal text style included 6-12 sentences followed by 1-3 examples. The minimal text style included 1-2 sentences followed by 1-3 examples. We conducted a randomized control study with 168 participants enrolled in a college-level Introduction to Computing course for non-computing majors. Each participant was randomly assigned one lesson style. We provided a pre-lesson and post-lesson quiz, each with ten questions. Additionally, the participants completed background and follow-up surveys. The study was part of a course homework assignment, so self-selection bias was limited. The course is primarily taken by non-majors and covers the basics of Word, Excel, and HTML. An improvement score is a participant's post-lesson minus pre-lesson quiz scores. The average improvement score for minimal text was 2.4 (6.5 - 4.1), which is higher (p-value <; 0.01) than the average improvement score for normal text of 1.1 (5.1 - 4.0). Thus, teaching the same topic using less text led to more learning. The conclusion is not that materials should be watered down, but rather that great attention should be paid to using minimal text while teaching the same core topics.","","Paper:978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344322","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344322","STEM;college education;college textbooks;digital content;digital education;digital learning;lesson assessment;minimal text;text length","Atmospheric measurements;Education;Google;Length measurement;Particle measurements;Usability;Writing","computer aided instruction;computer science education;teaching","Excel;Google search techniques;HTML;Word;computing course;course homework assignment;randomized control;student learning","","1","","13","","","","21-24 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We address in this paper the latter issue, of using data from professional networks for adjusting an engineering specialization curriculum. To this end, we built an adaptive recommender system that consists of several tools (modules) to create a data pipeline, perform data analysis tasks and provide recommendations for professors' council regarding the adjustment of the learning curriculum. The system includes an educational component with modules for course annotation, timeline generator based on learning curriculum and students' skills analysis, and a novel professional network analysis component, with modules to parse students' and graduates' profiles and extract their skills, creating a skills' timeline and identifying the most desired skills that should be (eventually more thoroughly) covered by the curricula. Through the automatic extraction of the set of skills covered by syllabi, compared with LinkedIn profile information for a significant percentage of our alumni (graduates) for the last 5 years, we were thus able to provide valuable feedback regarding the efficiency of our learning programmes.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8481-7; POD:978-1-4799-8482-4; USB:978-1-4799-8480-0","10.1109/ICSTCC.2015.7321402","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7321402","data mining;learning curriculum;professional network analysis;recommender system;social network","Companies;Computers;Education;Employment;Industries;LinkedIn","computer aided instruction;data mining;educational courses;engineering education;professional aspects;recommender systems;social networking (online)","LinkedIn profile information;SNA/PNA;adaptive recommender system;computer science course;course annotation;curriculum adjuster;data analysis tasks;data pipeline;economics course;educational component;engineering specialization curriculum;graduate profiles;learning curricula;learning programmes;mathematics course;physics course;professor council;recommendation system;skills timeline;social/professional network data analysis;sociology course;student profiles;student skills analysis;syllabi;timeline generator","","","","20","","","","14-16 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Remote labs allow devices, equipment, and instrumentations to be shared with other universities. In addition, they relax time and space constraints, and are capable of being adapted to the pace of each student; in the case, there was insufficient time in the laboratory. This paper describes an empirical study, which embeds two stages of assessment. In the first stage, we are concerned with finding out the level of flexibility when applying the engineering remote lab VISIR as a contemporary remote lab technology in the engineering faculty at Al-Quds University in Jerusalem in Palestine, and whether the engineering students will accept such technology to interact with in their future lab courses or not. In the second stage of the assessment study, a more in-depth comparative analysis will be carried out in order to have a categorization of VISIR in the landscape of the engineering labs, such as hands-on and simulations. The three lab approaches will be compared with each other by means of an experimental testing based on assessment criteria that are in accordance with the fundamental course objectives of engineering instructional labs: student's retention rate and satisfaction survey, as well as their performance.","1932-8540;19328540","","10.1109/RITA.2015.2452752","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155526","VISIR;comparative evaluation;design criteria;remote labs;survey instruments","Computers;Filtering theory;Instruments;Mathematical model;Servers;Testing;Usability","computer aided instruction;educational courses;engineering computing;engineering education;laboratories;virtual instrumentation","Al-Quds University;Jerusalem;Palestine;VISIR engineering remote lab;Virtual Instrument Systems in Reality;course objectives;engineering education;engineering faculty;engineering instructional labs;remote lab technology;satisfaction survey;student retention rate","","2","","35","","","20150713","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most of the companies or personalities are maintaining pages on these social media sites to interact with the users of these sites they are even posting messages, videos on these sites so that they can get attached by more and more users. Researches have shown even in latest 2014 elections that BJP used social media as its most liked option for promotion. The same was hit and liked by masses. Seeing this we can actually see the acceptance of 'Like' on the social media. It has become a measure to actually analyze and capture user interest on social media. It enables one to actually calculate and measure the user liking over certain objects. It gives the clear cut idea of user interest in a particular object and thus calculations can be made accordingly for sharing and promoting information or objects on social media sites [12]. We are trying to seek a model to analyze and mine the influence of 'Like' in social media. To calculate the effect on the object 'Like' mining algorithm is proposed along with the network model for social media.

This paper suggests the use of pervasive augmented reality (AR) for the design of a serious game that teaches navigational skills in a public environment. Many AR scavenger hunt games confront players with new environments by default, however they rarely focus explicitly on teaching navigational skills. We propose a concept that utilises augmented reality techniques for increased immersion and motivation, while upholding the real-world sense of presence for an easy transfer of orientation skills to everyday life. For this purpose, we implemented a first prototypical serious game in the form of an AR scavenger hunt. A preliminary evaluation regarding its usability produced promising results. As such, the prototype constitutes a first proof of concept. In future iterations, it will be further developed as an adaptive AR serious game, and evaluated in respect to its efficacy in teaching orientation and navigation skills.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6654-0; POD:978-1-4673-6655-7","10.1109/IE.2015.37","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194292","","Augmented reality;Cities and towns;Education;Games;Navigation;Prototypes;Usability","augmented reality;computer aided instruction;graphical user interfaces;mobile learning;serious games (computing);teaching","AR scavenger hunt games;adaptive AR serious game;critical skill;mobile augmented reality;navigation skills;navigational skills teaching;orientation aid;orientation skills transfer;pervasive augmented reality;public environments;scavenger hunt prototype;serious game design;teaching orientation","","2","","24","","","","15-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

TrajRank first allows users to interactively select a route, and segment it into several road segments. Then trajectories passing this route are automatically extracted. These trajectories are ranked on each road segment according to travel time and further clustered according to the rankings on all road segments.

"On the Participatory Design of Jeliot Mobile: Towards a Socio-Constructivist Mlearning Tool","M. M. Hassan; A. Moreno; E. Sutinen; A.

From the research point of view the authors want to (1) frame the development of the tool in the socio-constructivist paradigm, and (2) bring the learner-centeredness via participatory design. The paper reports a series of workshops in which HCI students were asked to design a mobile tool for learning programming. The workshops followed the participatory design methodology. Each workshop set its very participants into a scenario different than other workshops by means of variation in introductory tools. The participants output -- in the form of design ideas described with tools like sketches, storyboards, and/or simple text -- at each workshop was then collected. These ideas were classified according to five categories: socio-constructivist, learning management, usability, software visualization, and miscellaneous. Usability and socio-constructivist accounted for the majority of the ideas. The number usability ideas can be partly explained because of the context (participants were HCI students). However, the abundance of socio-constructivist ideas points to the importance which students give to learning in a sociocultural context. Moreover, the sheer amount of ideas -- otherwise not envisioned by the designers -- explains the need to build mlearning tools in a participatory fashion. Thus, the results of experiments support authors' stand of designing such tools in a learner-centered participatory fashion and framing the development in socio-constructivist paradigm.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9967-5; POD:978-1-4799-9968-2","10.1109/LaTiCE.2015.35","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7126243","Computer Science Education;Mlearning;Participatory Design;Software Visualization","Conferences;Context;Education;Games;Mobile communication;Usability;Visualization","computer aided instruction;computer science education;human computer interaction;mobile learning;software engineering","HCI students;Jeliot Mobile tool;design ideas;learner-centered participatory framework;learner-centeredness;learning management idea;miscellaneous idea;participatory design methodology;programming learning;sketch tool;socio-constructivist ideas;socio-constructivist m-learning tool;sociocultural context;software visualization idea;storyboard tool;text tool;usability idea","","3","","26","","","","9-12 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This educational paradigm is of paramount importance for society nowadays, because expands access opportunities to education at all levels. These learning environments can take advantage of Open Educational Resources. Using OER is a growing trend and it is turning into a recommendation by some governments and international education forums. Nevertheless, in spite of the availability of OER websites, quite a few of them do not consider accessibility design principles, therefore these websites present access barriers for users with disabilities. Besides, only a reduce number of these websites offer accessible resources, i.e. digital contents suitable for users with disabilities. On the other hand, in web environment, findability is a design consideration that improves the user's searchable experience by simplifying the location and acquisition of elements in websites. In this restricted scenario, findability of educational resources is a key issue for users with disabilities. In this research, we address the issue of findability of Open Educational Resources (OER), from the perspective of inclusive participation of users with disabilities, by considering three aspects: web accessibility, some usability best practices oriented to users with disabilities and Information Architecture.

Once the phone is locked, the user should take a specific action or provide some secret information to unlock the phone. The existing unlocking approaches can be categorized into four groups: motion, password, pattern, and fingerprint. Existing approaches do not support smart phones well due to the deficiency of security, high cost, and poor usability. We collect 200 users' handwaving actions with their smart phones and discover an appealing observation: the waving pattern of a person is kind of unique, stable and distinguishable. In this paper, we propose OpenSesame, which employs the users' waving patterns for locking/unlocking. The key feature of our system lies in using four fine-grained and statistic features of handwaving to verify users. Moreover, we utilize support vector machine (SVM) for accurate and fast classification. Our technique is robust compatible across different brands of smart phones, without the need of any specialized hardware. Results from comprehensive experiments show that the mean false positive rate of OpenSesame is around 15 percent, while the false negative rate is lower than 8 percent.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2014.2341633","Central Universities of China; Doctoral Program of Higher Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - NSFC; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6862001","Smart phone;accelerometer;authentication;privacy;security","Accelerometers;Intelligent sensors;Magnetic sensors;Mobile computing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Smart phones","biometrics (access control);message authentication;smart phones;support vector machines","OpenSesame;SVM;false positive rate;fine-grained feature;handwaving action;handwaving biometrics;screen locking;screen unlocking;secret information;smart phone;statistic feature;support vector machine;waving pattern","","6","","23","","","20140722","May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The system is designed for interactive tabletop systems, which promote collaboration by supporting face-to-face communication around a large work area. Since digital spaces facilitate the acquisition of a variety of data in real time, our system allows instructors to gather extensive and up-to-date information from students that could not be obtained otherwise in a traditional environment because of technical and time constraints. Leveraging this capability, we developed a mechanism that acts as an assistant to the instructor by automatically evaluating students according to certain parameters. Finally, to assess the capabilities of our system as a tool to support creativity, we conducted an experiment with Industrial Design students over the course of an academic year.

The concept that computers can comprehend our various gestures by eyes, voices, touch and our different movements to interact is called the Easy User Interface. Today, many elements are available in mobile phones, PCs and in other devices but the lack of voice to voice application on web are not efficient to the disabled people. Speech technologies particularly play a vital role in this evolving technology. Significant advancement in automatic voice recognition for well defined applications like dictation and medium vocabulary transaction processing assignments in web application is comparatively controlled environments have been made on web server. But, automatic speech recognition still has to reach a level needed for speech to become a completely pervasive user interface because even in clean acoustic surroundings in web application. Visual voice recognition, however, is a promising source of extra voice information and it has successfully exhibited to enhance noise robustness of automatic voice recognizers, so thereby promising to enhance their usability in the web application by use of voice interaction in web. In this paper, the main objective is to provide more easy interaction between user (disabled people) and web application. Today we are using web text by typing the text and in early days Google chrome enhances their functionality adding voice search. But we are trying to accessing all web text with the help of voice. We are using JSAPI components of speech recognition from the java technology, i.e., the voice and the text components along with the latest advancements made in the field of web uses. Further, the research goes beyond the recent advancements and discusses the future scope of speech recognition technology and mentions some likely future developments, evaluating each on the basis of its performance.","2347-9337;23479337","Electronic:978-1-4799-6393-5; POD:978-1-4799-6394-2","10.1109/ICAETR.2014.7012885","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7012885","CRD;human computer web interaction;pronounced;special education;speech recognition;teaching material;web speech recognition technology","Browsers;Engines;Grammar;Software;Speech;Speech processing;Speech recognition","Internet;handicapped aids;interactive systems;mobile computing;natural language processing;speech recognition","Easy User Interface;Google chrome;JSAPI components;Java technology;PC;Web technology;Web text;automatic speech recognition;automatic voice recognition;dictation;disabled people;interactive Web application;medium vocabulary transaction processing assignments;mobile phones;pervasive user interface;speech recognition technology;speech technologies;voice interaction;voice search;web server","","1","","16","","","","1-2 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The mobile game has been developed as means of helping public authorities to collect information and feedback on how public spaces could be improved based on collective intelligence procedures. Furthermore, as part of enhancing learning, the game intends to provide knowledge and awareness on sustainability issues for public constructions relevant to engineering and architectural disciplines. Deployed targeted questionnaires with thirty-three (33) computer science students in UK and analysed through a Likert Scale findings from evaluation demonstrate that a conceptual change may be achieved in relation to how sustainability has been perceived. A questionnaire with 20 questions was distributed to students for evaluating various elements of the game such as usability characteristics, accumulation, assimilation and consolidation of new knowledge patterns related to the learning-oriented benefits of the game with an implicit focus on whether the game can be integrated within an academic setting. The fundamental conclusion from the analysis of the game uptake is that it enhances student's engagement with sustainability issues, especially in blended learning contexts for `blending' different pedagogical approaches with game-oriented features as means of improving educational practice.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4742-3; POD:978-1-4799-4741-6; USB:978-1-4799-4743-0","10.1109/IMCTL.2014.7011135","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7011135","mobile serious games;public spaces;sustainability;urban cities","Cities and towns;Collaboration;Computers;Conferences;Education;Games;Mobile communication","computer aided instruction;environmental science computing;mobile learning;public administration;serious games (computing);sustainable development","Likert scale;Sustainability Serious Game;architectural discipline;blended learning;collective intelligence;engineering disciplines;game usability characteristics;knowledge pattern accumulation;knowledge pattern assimilation;knowledge pattern consolidation;learning-oriented game benefits;mobile game;public constructions;sustainability issues awareness","","0","","14","","","","13-14 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In designing Information Visualization (InfoVis), UCD models and methodologies have been adapted to address the peculiarity and diverse domain specifics of InfoVis. This UCD models' adaptation has been done in geovisualization, spatiotemporal InfoVis, biological data visualization, among others, with none on students' data focused InfoVis, despite the domain users' peculiarities. Furthermore, our study on actualization of higher education institutions (HEIs) students' data-focused InfoVis observes the incompatibility of the existing InfoVis UCD models of past related studies with the actualization of HEI domain-specific InfoVis. This incompatibility is arguably traceable to the peculiarity of the domain InfoVis users-data administrators, data analysts, the policy administrators and decision makers. Due to our work field experience, and objective argument from literatures reviewed, we employed a comparative content analysis and in-depth critique methods to modify the existing InfoVis UCD methodologies so as to feature additional stages to comply with our domain specificity. This study therefore presents a modified InfoVis UCD methodology that attends to the observed limitations of the previous works, and finally, our work in progress is presented.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5813-9; POD:978-1-4799-5814-6","10.1109/IUSER.2014.7002687","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7002687","InfoVis;InfoVis UCD methodology;higher education institution;user-centered design","Biology;Data visualization;Information systems;Usability;User centered design;Visualization","computer aided instruction;data visualisation;further education;user centred design","HEI domain-specific InfoVis;InfoVis UCD models;InfoVis user-data administrators;comparative content analysis;data analysts;higher education institutions;in-depth critique methods;information visualization;policy administrators;student data-focused InfoVis;user-centered design methodology;user-centered information system","","0","","17","","","","2-5 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some of the proven benefits of thin clients are lower cost of ownership and very less power consumption which supports to Green Computing. The ability of thin client can be increased by reducing network latency to improve the performance and usability of thin clients. Network latency causes a great delay in transmitting a message or communication from one location to another. Many other external factors, like congestion in the network, bandwidth limitation, computer storage capacities and the distance between two locations also contribute to the delay. The proposed paper aims at the issues of Network Latency and its various aspects in a thin client network. The paper also undergoes with experimenting thin client with different environment to find network latency which helped in finding conclusion and proposing new ideology for reducing network latency. The experiments are performed on simulated banking application and running it over thin client with different services.

Several research findings indicate various benefits of using IG in classroom. Nevertheless, IG software developed to date has been based on the desktop model where the interaction between a user and the IG software occurs through the conventional inputs and outputs methods: keyboard, mouse, and a monitor. Currently, this model is being challenged by the widespread adoption and use of mobile devices. In this scenario before building an IG software that can be effectively used in mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, where the input is based on touches and movements of fingers and the output is a small screen, there is a need to rethink the interface and what interaction methods should be employed. In response to this need, our paper examines the design and development of a GI application for mobile devices.

Although such laboratories have the benefit of allowing students to learn from mistakes without damaging remote equipment, student learning can be limited by denying them access to real data from real equipment. The primary contribution of this article is to outline the development of several mobile apps for interacting with real physical test beds in an automatic control laboratory, both in the laboratory and remotely. Results are provided from a preliminary investigation of the usability and user experience associated with the applications, using students who would ultimately be the users of the applications when they are integrated into the curriculum.

Although strong security measures are in place for most mobile systems, the area where these systems often fail is the reliance on the user to make decisions that impact the security of a device. As our prime example, Android relies on users to understand the permissions that an app is requesting and to base the installation decision on the list of permissions. Previous research has shown that this reliance on users is ineffective, as most users do not understand or consider the permission information. We propose a solution that leverages a method to assign a risk score to each app and display a summary of that information to users. Results from four experiments are reported in which we examine the effects of introducing summary risk information and how best to convey such information to a user. Our results show that the inclusion of risk-score information has significant positive effects in the selection process and can also lead to more curiosity about security-related information.","1545-5971;15455971","","10.1109/TDSC.2013.58","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6684532","Risk communication;mobile security;usability","Androids;Humanoid robots;Mobile communication;Privacy;Security;Smart phones","mobile computing;risk management;security of data;smart phones","Android Apps;device security;intrusive applications;malicious applications;mobile devices;mobile systems;risk communication;risk-score information;security measures;security-related information;summary risk information","","12","","36","","","20131216","May-June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The advancements in web technologies motivated the personalized learning, pressurizing for a more personalized course for individuals. The driving components of a personalized course are the course structure and the learning content. This paper highlights the research carried out in designing a personalized course. Prior knowledge and learning styles are the two major parameters considered here for personalizing a course. Also the paper considers majorly on Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) conformance of the personalized courses, encouraging re-usability and interoperability of the courses across multiple learning systems. The main theme of the paper is to propose a system that guides an instructor to understand and provide personalized course path including learning content, activities etc. The proposed system reduces the time and burden of the instructor by considering the group of learners rather than individuals, achieved through clustering the groups based on their similar learning styles, which represents a traditional teaching model applied by the instructors.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-4868-3; POD:978-1-4673-4869-0","10.1109/ICEED.2012.6779280","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779280","Cluster;Learning Style;Personalization;Prior Knowledge Test;SCORM","Electronic learning;Engineering education;Learning systems;Materials;Sequential analysis;Standards","Internet;computer aided instruction;distance learning;educational courses;open systems;personal computing;teaching","SCORM;Web technologies;course interoperability;course reusability;course structure;distant learning;e-learning;group clustering;instructor guided learning path personalization;learning content;learning styles;multiple learning systems;personalized course driving components;personalized learning;prior knowledge;sharable content object reference model;teaching model;traditional classroom","","0","","10","","","","5-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Assessing Design of Online Courses Using Bayesian Belief Networks","L. Forner; V. S. Kumar; Kinshuk","Comput. Studies Dept., Holland Coll., Charlottetown, PE, Canada","2013 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Technology for Education (t4e 2013)","20140303","2013","","","36","42","Even with recent research showing students enrolled in online courses are outperforming those in traditional courses, the need to assess the instructional design of online courses is greater than ever due to increasing enrollments and attrition rates that continue to be significantly higher than traditional courses. Most past research used surveys for course assessment, which measure only perceptions. Recently researchers have proposed more holistic assessments of online courses using Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to integrate multiple assessment instruments. While the advantages of BBNs for educational assessments have been demonstrated, past research used only simulated data. This study furthers past research by testing the suitability of BBN-based methodologies for real-time assessment of online courses using larger data sets with missing and sparse data. Testing used actual course data from two undergraduate online Java programming courses. Past literature identified the creation of the conditional probability tables (CPTs) as the greatest challenge of using BBNs. This research also investigated the automatic population of CPTs via software. Tests revealed excellent performance with large data sets demonstrating the scalability of BBN-based assessment methodologies for online courses with large enrollments. With a well-designed network, most of the CPTs can be populated via software, significantly reducing the time and effort required to design and use the BBN. A number of recommendations to improve usability, performance, and accuracy of BBN-based course assessment methodologies are demonstrated. Future research should provide a comparative analysis between BBNs and other methodologies for the assessment of online course design.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5141-8; POD:978-1-4799-1651-1","10.1109/T4E.2013.17","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6751056","BBN;Bayesian Belief Networks;Course assessments;Online course design","Bayes methods;Instruments;Java;Peer-to-peer computing;Probabilistic logic;Software;Testing","Bayes methods;Java;belief networks;computer aided instruction;distance learning;educational courses","BBN-based course assessment;Bayesian belief network;attrition rate;conditional probability table;educational assessment;enrollment;instructional design;online course design;undergraduate online Java programming course","","0","","22","","","","18-20 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, students often unknowingly interpreted the log scale as linear and were confused about the order of magnitude of a value in the negative exponent region. To address these issues, we used the results of our findings to develop and implement a set of online “essential skills” tasks to help students achieve a core level of mastery and fluency in reading log plots, a basic and critical skill for engineers. The online tasks were administered as for-credit homework assigned several times throughout the semester, and students spent 10-20 minutes on each assignment. Results of post-tests indicate that with this minimal practice, students were able to dramatically improve their accuracy in reading log plots compared to a control group with no log plot practice. Furthermore, testing one month after training demonstrated that student continued to retain the learned skill. Future development will focus on making these essentials skills task broadly available online and further improving effectiveness and usability.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4673-5261-1; POD:978-1-4673-5259-8; USB:978-1-4673-5260-4","10.1109/FIE.2013.6684990","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6684990","graph interpretation;logarithmic graphs;online homework;problem solving skills","Educational institutions;Engineering students;Interviews;Materials;Standards;Testing;Training","computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;graph theory;materials science computing","effectiveness improvement;for-credit homework assignment;logarithmic graphs;logarithmic plot reading;negative exponent region;online essential skills tasks;science engineering course;standard introductory materials;student accuracy improvement;university junior engineering students;university senior engineering students;university sophomore engineering students;usability improvement","","1","","8","","","","23-26 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence from the very beginning eLearning was introduced also virtual lessons were a part of the curriculum. In the first years the handling of the virtual lessons was purely manual resulting in a huge amount of administrative efforts for the teachers and the staff. Since 2008 we consecutively introduced software and interfaces between the learning management system and our central administration system in order to automatize virtual lessons as much as possible and significantly reduce the administrative efforts from the teachers. With the introduction of version 2 of this interface called MOMOS we have now also a good usability for the administration staff. In this paper we describe how we applied our infrastructure managing virtual lessons in medical education to our modular based curriculum. Furthermore we give some evaluation results from students on the usage of one specific virtual lesson implemented as an eLecture.

As physics is involved in everything in life; engineering, electronics, medicine, and space being some examples, it is vital that the basic concepts can be understood and explained. Fortunately, modern technology has the means to inject some much needed interest into the subject, and allows for multiple new formats of learning. Technology influences most of everyday life and therefore it provides an exciting solution to the problems faced within physics education. This paper aims to provide an alternative platform for physics education in a format that appeals to users. As computer games are becoming ever-increasingly popular, their role in education becomes more and more vital. In this work, a prototype was developed to teach physics concepts and could potentially be used to supplement traditional teaching methods. As a result of this work, a series of short games displaying physics principles were developed and the results of testing and evaluation suggest that video games can be a viable educational medium and could be applied to a wide range of areas.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-0820-2; POD:978-1-4799-0819-6","10.1109/CGames.2013.6632617","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6632617","Physics;computer games;education","Computers;Education;Games;Physics;Prototypes;Testing;Usability","computer aided instruction;computer games;educational courses;physics computing;physics education","computer games;educational medium;electronics;engineering;medicine;modern technology;physics concepts;physics education;physics principles;short games;space;teaching methods;video games","","1","","27","","","","July 30 2013-Aug. 1 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tablets and iPads, which are prevalent, can be utilized with dementia patients in portraying favorite music and family photographs via apps developed in close partnership with geriatric facilities. Anecdotal research has shown that non-verbal late-stage dementia patients have become stimulated when iPods played their beloved tunes. There is an unmet need in geriatric facilities for stimulating dementia patients, as well providing hard-core data for proving increased cognitive abilities with technology. Technology can help bridge the gap between patients and staff to improve the quality of life for the cognitively impaired. This study addresses cognitive functioning and quality of life for people diagnosed with dementia via technology. In recent times, the influx of older adults suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia related illness has impacted the U.S. Healthcare system. Cognition significantly declines in older adults with AD or dementia over the course of the disease, causing most to be dependent on caregivers, thus routinely institutionalized. Caregivers are often required to focus their attention on addressing the agitation or discomfort of the AD or dementia patient. Research has shown that technology instruments such as iPods, help stimulate those with dementia. This study focuses on innovative devices such as iPads and tablets, which are mainstream and easy to use, cannot only help determine stage of dementia, but also provide stimulation to improve cognitive functioning. It is hoped that this research will analyze that specially created apps and existing assistive software can be used to decrease the symptoms and improve cognition of older adults suffering from AD or other dementia related diseases. Via service-learning courses, students developed an easy-to-use application for tablets to help- older adults with disabilities more readily use the technology. Student programmers produced apps and performed usability tests with the dementia patients, as well as met with geriatric facility personnel to produce application software that meets the patients, family, and caregiver needs and expectations. For example, a student term project produced an application entitled Candoo that utilizes Google's voice recognition and synthesis engine to navigate the web, provide the weather, and supply pill reminder alerts. Another application example included one that allows families to electronically send photographs, video clips, and favorite music from anywhere to loved ones for enjoyment. Furthermore, older adults were assessed by nursing students for cognitive functioning before, and after the semester's intervention. Such mobile apps could allow dementia persons to become less agitated and stay in their homes longer, while also providing awareness and positive change of attitude by those of another generation towards the elderly. This research will discuss student developed mobile applications in the scope of helping improve the quality of life of patients with AD or dementia.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6245-0; POD:978-1-4673-6244-3","10.1109/LISAT.2013.6578252","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6578252","Accessibility;Aged User;Assistive Technologyies;Computer Science Education;Elderly;Older Adults;Senior Citizen;Software Engineering;Sundowning","Animals;Dementia;Mobile communication;Sociology;Statistics;Tablet computers","cognition;diseases;geriatrics;handicapped aids;mobile computing;patient treatment;speech recognition;speech synthesis","AD;Alzheimer patients;Candoo;Google voice recognition;Google voice synthesis engine;US healthcare system;caregiver anecdotes;cognitive abilities;cognitive functioning;geriatric facilities;iPads;iPods;mobile app development;music;nonverbal late-stage dementia patients;older adults;photographs;service-learning courses;student programmers;tablet application;usability research;usability tests;video clips","","5","","19","","","","3-3 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Influence of learning styles and academic achievement on performance and preference in different learning modes: An adaptive hypermedia approach","A. K. Hazra; P. Patnaik; D.

Six modules in history and engineering were designed in verbal, visual and multimedia modes. Hundred and four undergraduate students of the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur participated and completed the six modules. The performance in each module was assessed on the basis of recall, recognition, comprehension, and transfer of learning. Based on Inventory of Learning Styles, learners were categorized in visual-verbal and sequential-global dimensions. The verbal, neutral, and visual learners and the sequential, neutral, and global learners did not differ in performance across disciplines. Learners' performance in visual mode for history and in multimedia mode for engineering was found to be superior to other modes. High academic achievers performed better for recognition and comprehension dimensions in history, and recognition dimension in engineering than low academic achievers. Irrespective of learning styles or academic achievements students preferred and found more appropriate visual and multimedia modes over verbal mode of learning. We believe that the null results for learning styles suggest their limited usability for adaptive hypermedia. Similarly, Mayer's multimedia learning cannot be recommended as the most effective mode of learning for all disciplines. We suggest that adaptivity according to disciplines is an important area that needs to be explored.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-4369-5; POD:978-1-4673-4367-1","10.1109/IHCI.2012.6481811","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6481811","adaptive hypermedia;engineering;history;learning preference;learning styles;sequential-global;visual-verbal","Animation;Education;History;Indexes;Materials;Multimedia communication;Visualization","computer aided instruction;hypermedia;multimedia computing","Felder-Silverman learning styles;Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur;Mayer generative theory;academic achievement;adaptive hypermedia approach;different learning modes;learning styles;multimedia learning;multimedia mode;multimedia modes;undergraduate students;verbal modes;visual modes","","1","","48","","","","27-29 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, pervasive applications need a middleware that can detect and act upon any context changes created by the result of any interactions between users, applications, and surrounding computing environment for applications without users, interventions. To achieve this goal, one of the problems is how to continuously monitor/capture and interpret the environment related information efficiently to assure high context awareness by the middleware. Many attentions have been paid to the research of the context-aware pervasive applications. Existing context information that supports service (component) adaptations is provided by the context-aware infrastructure, which gathers, pre-processes and provisions context information from a variety of context information sources. However, the context-aware applications is usually prone to failures and disconnections that negatively impact on the ability of them to adapt (and therefore dramatically impact on their usability). So we should take the Quality of Context (QoC) into account. And the procession of gathering, pre-processing and providing context information must be autonomic to the end users. Therefore, we propose an autonomic quality management middleware to support QoC management based context provision. By this middleware, we can configure different strategies to refinery raw context, discard duplicate and inconsistent context adaptively so as to protect and provide QoS-enriched context information of users to context-aware applications and services.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-0242-5; POD:978-1-4673-0241-8","10.1109/ICCSE.2012.6295288","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295288","Agent;Context-aware;Pervasive;QoC;middleware","Cognition;Computers;Context;Context-aware services;Middleware;Sensors","middleware;mobile computing;quality of service","QoS-enriched context information;autonomic context processing;autonomic quality management middleware;context awareness;context-aware pervasive applications;distributed mobile computing;environment related information;information technology;refinery raw context","","1","","13","","","","14-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Software as a Service (SaaS) in a cloud computing environment allows these companies to focus on providing more competitive services instead of maintenance. As delivery of computing as a service, a trustworthy cloud service widely depends upon its reliability. For this reason, a newly defined Quality of Reliability (QoR) for cloud services is proposed in this paper. To achieve a good QoR, we not only analyze system events from both service consumers and providers, but also provide a layered composable system accounting architecture for cloud systems. A pipelined approach and a dependence estimation algorithm are introduced for pattern recognition and event analysis and prediction. A self-healing layer is also designed to achieve automatic recovery by re-composing services according to their functionalities and non-functional requirements. An implementation of this framework in an education services environment confirms the advantages over extant system accounting systems.","","Electronic:978-07695-4753-4; Electronic:978-1-4673-3049-7; POD:978-1-4673-3049-7","10.1109/SCC.2012.33","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6274131","Cloud Service;Composable Architecture;Layered Architecture;Quality of Reliability (QoR);System Accounting","Algorithm design and analysis;Pattern matching;Pipelines;Prediction algorithms;Probability;Reliability;Usability","cloud computing;software architecture;software quality;software reliability;trusted computing","Internet;cloud computing environment;cloud service reliability;dependence estimation algorithm;education services environment;enterprise application service;event analysis;event prediction;functionalities requirement;layered composable system accounting architecture;nonfunctional requirement;pattern recognition;pipelined approach;quality of reliability;self-healing layer;service recomposition;software as a service;system accounting approach;trustworthy cloud service","","4","","","","","","24-29 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is frustrating for any WSNs user, developer or manager. To reverse this tendency and thus improve the quality of experience and user-friendliness in WSNs, we designed FLEXOR, a sustainable software architecture optimized to support the implementation, rapid prototyping, evaluation, and testing of wireless sensor network applications, that is platform independent and user-friendly. FLEXOR is designed to accommodate many different applications and services for wireless sensor networks and foster code re-usability and cross-platform component re-usability. FLEXOR offers high modularity, well defined interfaces, remote node management functionality as well as run-time module exchange. Finally, the introduction of a unifying way for WSNs development opens to a higher homogeneity and thus to more easy comparison among different solutions. We present here an analysis of FLEXOR from these new angles and show how effective it is for several purposes and in particular for non-experts and in education.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1239-4; POD:978-1-4673-1238-7; USB:978-1-4673-1237-0","10.1109/WoWMoM.2012.6263698","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263698","Architecture;Mobility;QoE;Sustainable reuse;User-friendliness;Wireless Sensor Networks","Computer architecture;Hardware;Programming;Protocols;Routing;Software architecture;Wireless sensor networks","sensor placement;telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","FLEXOR;WSN evaluation;WSN testing;cross-platform component reusability;foster code reusability;management skills;quality of experience;rapid prototyping;remote node management functionality;run-time module exchange;sustainable software architecture;user-friendly wireless sensor network development","","4","","21","","","","25-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The teacher often faces challenges to design adequate physics problems because it demands a high effort to have enough variety of exercises for several students' levels. In addition, it is important to display exercises in an attractive visual and interactive environment, but this requires deep computer knowledge. Most common simulators in the literature are visually attractive, but are often designed to solve a particular or limited problem. Authoring tools have the advantage to allow building several learning environments, involving professors without computer expertise. Therefore, teachers require less effort and time to develop simulation problems. In this work we present an on line authoring simulation tool, called AuthorPhysics, aimed to facilitate the design of physics active learning problems, reducing instructors' time and effort. An initial evaluation of the usability and benefits of the system for the instructors was carried on. The results are encouraging in the sense that teachers are able to create a great variety of physical scenarios and problems, appropriate for introductory undergraduate and high-school physics courses.

The basic infrastructure of ubiquitous computing system is wireless network environment, and a RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) system is composed tags, readers, middleware, application services, etc. and uses networks. RFID middleware is system software that collects a large volume of raw data generated in RFID environment, filters the data, summarizes them into meaningful information and delivers the information to application services. RFID middleware links hardware to conventional middleware. Previous researches on RFID middleware have covered middleware from SUN, SAP, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, etc. These products attach importance to different quality characteristics, and there have been few researches on the quality properties of RFID middleware. The present study examined functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency and portability among the quality characteristics of software in international standard ISO/IEC 9126 as well as the quality elements of standard RFID middleware of EPC Global, and based on them we extracted and analyzed items for evaluating the quality of RFID middleware in ubiquitous computing systems. Using the AHP (Analytic hierarchy process) that enables rational decision making by simplifying complicated problems, we evaluated the subjective characteristics of stakeholders in an objective way and proposed a selection method that evaluates quality using quality evaluation criteria. The proposed evaluation selection method is useful for developers who are going to develop RFID middleware in areas such as distribution and logistics to select RFID middleware suitable for their environment.","","POD:0-7695-2674-8","10.1109/ICHIT.2006.253690","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4021295","","Application software;Computer networks;IEC standards;ISO standards;Middleware;Radiofrequency identification;Software standards;System software;Ubiquitous computing;Wireless networks","","","","10","","15","","","","9-11 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there are few factors such as time, safety and cost that hold certain experiments in schools from being conducted in the lab. Instruction using computer based training in education using computer supported virtual laboratory has been reported to provide many advantages over other learning techniques. In this paper, we discuss stages involved in the proposed conceptual framework as a guide to develop virtual laboratory for biology (VLab-Bio) which is divided into three phases namely: identifying research problem, design and develop VLab-Bio prototype and usability testing of the prototype. In the first phase we reported results of a preliminary study which shows that “Describe the application of knowledge on mitosis in cloning” is the learning objective to be focused as a content in VLab-Bio. In the second phase, we described the process involved in the framework to structure, plan and control the process of developing the VLab-Bio. In the third phase we suggested six items that will be used in the future usability testing. It is hoped that the proposed conceptual framework for developing VLab-Bio prototype will be workable as a guide for developing an educational software such as VLab-Bio.","2155-6822;21556822","Electronic:978-1-4577-0752-0; POD:978-1-4577-0753-7","10.1109/ICEEI.2011.6021732","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6021732","Biology education;Information and communication technology;Virtual Laboratory;Virtual learning;virtual environment","Biology;Educational institutions;Laboratories;Prototypes;Usability","biology computing;computer based training;laboratories;virtual reality","VLab-Bio laboratory;biology laboratory;computer based training;computer supported virtual laboratory;educational software;science laboratory;usability testing","","1","","18","","","","17-19 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a literature review and critical analysis about existing frameworks and models, organizing the state of the art in emotional quality, towards educational system design. This review puts in evidence the missing core in the subject. We then present the concept of Affectibility as the guiding point from which the use and design of system-user interaction could be treated.

This is due to the advancement of technologies equipped in majority of the mobile phones which makes the devices become more capable of supporting the learning and teaching activities. Mobile learning (m-learning) is a learning tool which can be run on mobile devices. Mobile System Analysis and Design (MOSAD) has been developed with the content of a topic from the System Analysis and Design (SAD) course conducted at Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS (UTP). This paper presents the results of the testings conducted for MOSAD application. A heuristic test involving 5 experts in the area of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) was conducted after the first version of MOSAD was completed to strengthen its functionality and usability. Then, Post Test Quasi Experimental Design (QED) was conducted to 116 UTP second year students who took the SAD course to test the effectiveness and usability of MOSAD after it has been revised. The results show that the students who had used MOSAD (66 out of the 116 students) as their revision tool for answering ten quiz questions performed better the other group of students (50 out of the 116 students) who used traditional methods of revision. The usability test was adopted from Purdue Usability Testing tested on consistency, learnability, flexibility, minimal action and minimal memory load of MOSAD. Both results indicate that MOSAD is effective and usable as a revision tool for the higher education students.","","Electronic:978-1-61284-406-0; POD:978-1-61284-407-7","10.1109/ICPAIR.2011.5976941","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5976941","Heuristic Test;Mobile Learning;Post Test Quasi Experimental Design;Usability Test","Digital audio broadcasting;Education;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Prototypes;Testing;Usability","computer aided instruction;design;human computer interaction;mobile computing","MOSAD;Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS;education sector;human computer interaction;mobile learning course content application;mobile phone technologies;mobile system analysis and design;quasi experimental design;revision tool","","1","","15","","","","28-29 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents the review of available tools with respect to their usability, sampling rate capability, the necessary software needs and also the financial requirements. Most of approaches require the C code generation using Real-Time Workshop. However e.g. the Real-Time Toolbox works directly with normal mode of Simulink which can be especially recommended for the educational applications. The paper briefly describes several case studies where undergraduate students can deal with real educational models without previous knowledge of the real-time systems. The list of available hardware and software tools is not complete but includes all important approaches: low cost general purpose I/O card with/without C code generation, high-performance hardware for comfort rapid prototyping or hardware-in-the-loop simulation and code generation for embedded targets (16 or 32bit microcontrollers or DSP).","","Electronic:978-1-61284-985-0; POD:978-1-61284-982-9","10.1109/ICMECH.2011.5971238","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5971238","","Electronic mail;MATLAB;Mathematical model;Mobile communication;Read only memory;Rotors","control engineering computing;digital signal processing chips;engineering education;mechatronics;microcontrollers;program compilers;rapid prototyping (industrial);real-time systems","16-bit microcontroller;32-bit microcontroller;C code generation;Matlab;Simulink;digital signal processor;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;mechatronic education;mechatronic practice;mechatronic research;rapid prototyping;realtime control prototyping;realtime workshop","","10","","16","","","","13-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It includes desktop systems as well as embedded systems in different devices. Success of a technology simply results from the easiness with which the user can interact with it. If the interface is poor or hard to use then the user will simply ignore the product or the technology. A simple and easy way to use a system doesn't mean that a simple technology is behind such a system, on the contrary, a well advanced technology needed to build it. The most important concepts in HCI are functionality and usability. Services provided usually by a system are called functions. Usability is when a user utilizes the system's functions easily, properly and clearly. Functionality and usability may vary from one system to another. A system is said to be successful if there is a balance between both functionality and usability. In this paper we will look at existing HCI and the recent advances in the field.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8728-8; POD:978-1-4244-8727-1","10.1109/CSAE.2011.5953178","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5953178","GPS;HCI;PDAs;RFID","Computers;Human computer interaction;Humans;Robot sensing systems;Speech recognition;Usability","embedded systems;human computer interaction;interactive systems","HCI;desktop systems;embedded systems;human-computer interaction;interactive computing systems;system functionality;system usability","","1","","6","","","","10-12 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The navigation technique was investigated as a potential technique that could be applied to display information on a mobile device. Navigation technique is based on point-and-click interaction on hierarchical structure of links. In order to determine how well this navigation technique solves the above problems, a prototype for learning Programming C++ was developed and a usability testing was conducted.

Pervasive learning spaces (PLSs) create bridges from the real world to the virtual world, allowing the context-sensitive utilization of real-world objects and information in the learning process. Thus far, no model of technology integration for PLSs exists. We present a three-year process during which several game-based PLSs were developed. Based on the development experiences and a series of literature analyses, we present a technology integration model for game-based PLSs. The model meets the requirements of context, pedagogy, and game-design with technology. From these requirements, we derive three critical factors for technology integration in PLSs: 1) context-awareness, 2) available resources, and 3) unobtrusiveness of the technology. The model is discussed and evaluated through applying the model to the development process of LieksaMyst, a game-based PLS for a museum. User perceptions and usability of our games are also evaluated. The model can be utilized by PLS designers and developers for determining which requirements must be considered when integrating technology into a PLS. While the foundations of a technology integration model are now laid, work remains to be done in identifying development and evaluation methods based on the model.","1939-1382;19391382","","10.1109/TLT.2010.16","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5518760","Pervasive learning;context-awareness;game-based learning.;pervasive learning space;technology integration","Analytical models;Context modeling;Educational institutions;Games;Mobile handsets;Pervasive computing","computer aided instruction;computer games;ubiquitous computing","LieksaMyst;context-awareness;game-based PLSs;game-based pervasive learning spaces;mobile learning;technology integration","","10","","39","","","20100723","Oct.-Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

When evaluating mobile game-based learning (mGBL), conventional usability heuristics evaluations lack comprehension and difficult to be directly implemented. Therefore, heuristics evaluation strategy is proposed to evaluate specifically for mGBL. The strategy consists of four components: Game Usability, Mobility, Game Play, and Learning Content. Each of the components represents the issues to be considered and evaluated for mGBL. Additionally, in this study, a prototype of mGBL was developed and evaluated by utilizing the proposed strategy. The results indicate that the strategy is useful and potential to be implemented for similar mGBL applications.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6428-9; POD:978-1-4244-6427-2","10.1109/WMUTE.2010.27","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5476548","heuristics evaluation;mGBL;mobile game;mobile game-based learning","Art;Educational institutions;Educational technology;Handheld computers;Mobile handsets;Personal digital assistants;Prototypes;Smart phones;Usability;User interfaces","computer games;distance learning;mobile computing","game play;game usability;heuristics evaluation strategy;learning content;mobile game based learning;mobility","","3","","16","","","","12-16 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By using the effective SCORM-based Sharable CRMS to manage their files, teachers can reduce their workload and thus focus their efforts on substantiating content of teaching. Once teachers upload their content objects, the system would promptly produce a SCORM-based file and create a content package for use and retrieval by users. On the other hand, teachers can browse and download desired content packages through the system to assemble new content objects. Finally, the study proceeds an evaluation and discusses system satisfaction. The internal consistence of evaluation reach up to 0.902 under consistence analysis.

Individuals who are deaf require visual or signaling system in order to achieve the transmission and reception of ideas. Both mechanisms have been considered in the implementation through the use of graphics that let the student associate ideas with vocabulary, and the use of cued speech as the mechanism of communicating information. This software is not only for helping deaf children to learn about their environment, but also this tool will help with the integration with the rest of the classmates through the teaching of cued speech to both kind of students. Because the software implies pedagogical concepts an extended methodology for developing educational software has been followed, as result of this process is showed through a prototype.

This paper discusses the heuristic evaluation of a mobile learning prototype for children aged between 10 and 12 years old. It was developed using JCreator LE and Sun Wireless Toolkit 2.5.2 platform software. The prototype consists of learning material from the Science subject that is taught in all primary schools in Malaysia. It focuses on a subtopic relating to Basic Needs of Human. The researchers envisioned that such application can be used as a revision aid that will complement the use of textbooks and workbooks in the classroom learning. The first prototype was evaluated using heuristic evaluation technique with five software ergonomic experts. The evaluation revealed few design issues that should be refined in order to improve its usability before testing it on the real users, the children.

Designing ITSs using ITSATs by teachers seems to be difficult to realize. This could be affected by insufficient features in ITASTs which meet teachers' requirements. This paper presents feature analysis of ITSATs. In this study, we examined two categories of features: authoring environment and lesson content creation. The study focuses on three ITSAT namely CTAT, ASPIRE and Assistment Buider.

On the contrary, in medicine, the applications of VR are not as extensive as in other fields. However, realistic VR surgery simulations are in high demand as a result of offering risk-free training environments for physicians. The necessity of realism compels researchers to adopt physics-based models and haptic renderings that place extra computation burdens on real-time rendering pipelines. In this study, we investigate the usability of already built-in physics-based models in physics/or game engine PhysX library, for scooping operations in artificial cervical disc replacement (ACDR) surgery. The motivation behind our work is twofold. First, intricacies involved in ACDR surgery are introduced and the fundamental components towards the development of a surgical simulator are addressed. Second, an on-going framework development is introduced for the scooping action based on the PhysX library which provides optimized and physics-based methods for a plausible simulation. Our simulator framework integrates a haptic device into the PhysX environment for force feedback in order to increase plausibility.","1062-922X;1062922X","POD:978-1-4244-2793-2","10.1109/ICSMC.2009.5346764","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5346764","artificial cervical disc replacement surgery;curette;physx;surgery simulation;vertebrae C4 and C5;virtual reality","Computational modeling;Engines;Haptic interfaces;Libraries;Medical simulation;Physics computing;Pipelines;Surgery;Usability;Virtual reality","biomedical education;computer based training;force feedback;medical computing;real-time systems;rendering (computer graphics);software libraries;surgery;virtual reality","PhysX library;artificial cervical disc replacement surgery;force feedback;game engine;haptic device;haptic renderings;medical training;physics-based models;real-time rendering pipelines;risk-free training environments;scooping simulation framework;surgical simulator;virtual reality simulations","","0","","22","","","","11-14 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We proposed an implementation of trustworthy dissemination of digital contents by using a third party attestation proxy-enabling remote attestation model with the privacy protection of the front-end user device environment. Also, a Xen virtualization-based terminal platform architecture, which primarily enforces the domain isolation among the processes or key components, was presented. Finally, an application case manifested the proposed model and platform architecture not only realized the remote integrity verification of user end devices that was carried out on the back-end contents server side, but effectively protected the platform states privacy, further improving the usability of DRM system.","","POD:978-0-7695-3556-2","10.1109/MMIT.2008.133","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5089124","Digital Rights Management;Remote Attestation;Trusted Computing;Trustworthy Dissemination;Virtualization Technology","Computer network management;Computer science education;Content management;Information technology;Multimedia systems;Platform virtualization;Privacy;Protection;Protocols;Technology management","data integrity;digital communication;digital rights management;media streaming;protocols;telecommunication computing","DRM;digital contents;digital rights management;front-end user device;proxy-enabling remote attestation model;security;third party attestation;trusted computing;trustworthy","","1","1","10","","","","30-31 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two studies provide initial evaluation of user behavior with a MRH patient and the usability and acceptability of a MRH patient for practice and evaluation of medical students' clinical skills. In Study I (n = 8) it was observed that students treated MRHs as social actors more than students in prior interactions with virtual human patients (n = 27), and used interpersonal touch to comfort and reassure the MRH patient similarly to prior interactions with human patients (n = 76). In the within-subjects Study II (n = 11), medical students performed a clinical breast exam on each of a MRH and human patient. Participants performed equivalent exams with the MRH and human patients, demonstrating the usability of MRHs to evaluate students' exam skills. The acceptability of the MRH patient for practicing exam skills was high as students rated the experience as believable and educationally beneficial. Acceptability was improved from Study I to Study II due to an increase in the MRH's visual realism, demonstrating that visual realism is critical for simulation of specific interpersonal scenarios.","1077-2626;10772626","","10.1109/TVCG.2008.195","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4689554","Artificial;Intelligent agents;Life and Medical Sciences;Virtual reality;and virtual realities;augmented","Biomedical imaging;Breast;Computational modeling;Humans;Image processing;Medical simulation;Medical treatment;Technological innovation;Usability;Virtual reality","biomedical education;computer aided instruction;medical computing;virtual reality","clinical breast exam;clinical skills;medical students';mixed reality humans;touch-driven communication;user behavior;visual realism","Breast;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Consumer Satisfaction;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Humans;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Models, Biological;Palpation;Task Performance and Analysis;Touch;User-Computer Interface","18","","28","","","","May-June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Now more and more researchers know that filter must be based on the meaning of the word but not on a specific sequence of signs, so they pay more and more attention on filtering method based on semantics recently. However, the usability of these methods is inconvenient up to now, because they must be supported by plentiful rules and domain knowledge. To improve filtering precision and recall, this paper presents a novel method to text information filtering based on user ontology model (UOM), so that the machines can understand user's requirements and text content to some extent, and the filtering results are more suitable for the users' requirements. The method includes user model building, text structure analyzing, text conception extracting, semantic correlation computing and so on. The filtering method based on UOM can not only express the complex requirements but also avoid building domain ontology, so its efficiency and usability have a great promotion. In order to enlarge the filtering result set and to improve the recall rate, the virtual relationship, a kind of fuzzy semantic relationship, is introduced in the semantic similarity estimation effectively. This method is applied to the system of intelligent on-demand services for teaching resource on Internet. The results show that it can provide filtering services effectively. Although the experiments are only tested in Chinese text documents, these methods can be employed in other languages.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3398-8","10.1109/ICYCS.2008.116","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4709228","Semantic Correlation;Semantic Relationship;Text Filtering;User Ontology Model;Virtual Relationship","Buildings;Data mining;Education;Fuzzy sets;Information filtering;Information filters;Intelligent systems;Ontologies;Usability;Web and internet services","Internet;information filtering;natural language processing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);text analysis","Chinese text documents;Chinese text information filtering method;content processing;domain knowledge;semantic correlation computing;text conception extracting;text structure analyzing;user ontology model","","1","","12","","","","18-21 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the rapid development of mobile devices, the widespread provision of connectivity, as well as well-modeled learning services, all presumptions for effective m-learning implementations are fulfilled. The acceptance of such systems is however highly dependent on usability, implying particular emphasis on the design of both application user interfaces and interaction. In this paper we discuss a holistic approach to personalization of mobile human-computer interaction, targeting the improvement of the overall user experience. Within this context we analyze the possibilities for m-learning application adjustment regarding mobile device capabilities, student domain knowledge level, and interaction style and skills. Personalization issues are explained along with the respective functional models, with special focus on the menu component model, which is transformable according to users' navigation patterns.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3367-4","10.1109/UBICOMM.2008.54","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4641352","m-learning;mobile HCI;personalization;universal usability","Education;Educational institutions;Insurance;Mobile computing;Mobile handsets;Navigation;Pervasive computing;Ubiquitous computing;Usability;User interfaces","computer aided instruction;continuing professional development;human computer interaction;mobile computing","lifetime learning;m-learning;menu component model;mobile devices;mobile human-computer interaction;student domain knowledge level;ubiquitous computing;users navigation patterns","","6","","16","","","","Sept. 29 2008-Oct. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Collocated AAR presents novel challenges for MR, such as collocating time, interactions, and visualizations of previous and current experiences. We created a collocated AAR system for anesthesia education, the augmented anesthesia machine visualization and interactive debriefing system (AAMVID). The system was evaluated in two studies by students (n=19) and educators (n=3).

Pragmatic questions are not the easiest for mathematically inclined computer scientists to address. They refer by nature to people and their habits, sociology, and the day's technological demands. An industrial psychology literature, apart from computing, has sometimes addressed questions of this kind. But this kind of study must become part of programming language theory within computing. It's the importance of just these kinds of questions that makes programmers choose scripting languages.

The main game runs on the teacherpsilas portable PC projected on a large screen, whereas the students will interact with the game using their own mobile phones. Lecture Quiz is a multiplayer quiz game, which offers a variation in game modes where unlimited number of players can play simultaneously. Games like Lecture Quiz are most useful for testing and rehearsing theory. As a bonus, the teacher will get quantitative data on how much of the theory the students actually have learned. The evaluation of Lecture Quiz was performed in a software architecture lecture where twenty students first played the game and then were asked to fill in an evaluation form. The focus of the evaluation was on usability of the system and the perceived usefulness of using Lecture Quiz in lectures. The results of the evaluation show that Lecture Quiz was easy to use and that it contributed to increased learning. Further, Lecture Quiz was perceived as entertaining, and half of the students claimed they would attend more lectures if such systems were used regularly.","1093-0175;10930175","POD:978-0-7695-3144-1","10.1109/CSEET.2008.15","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4556966","Software engineering education;evaluation;game concept;usability","Computer science education;Educational institutions;Educational technology;Games;Mobile handsets;Portable computers;Software architecture;Software engineering;Testing;Usability","computer aided instruction;computer games;mobile computing","Lecture Quiz;lecture game;mobile games;mobile phones;multiplayer quiz game","","14","","23","","","","14-17 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They were videotaped while working and interviewed after the experiment. The principal results are as follows: both groups of subjects often repurposed exercises and others' educational materials placed at their disposal rather than simply reusing them; both groups reused others' material, either totally or partially, and in the latter case, they reused the structure, the content, or the concept; both groups produced exercises comprising more than one educational activity; and the exercises produced by subjects working asynchronously displayed a content-driven strategy while those produced by subjects working synchronously displayed an activity/practice-driven strategy. Moreover, within-group and between-group differences could be observed in the scanning and use of others' materials.

We propose an end user service composition approach for reducing the composition complexity and difficulty from the end user perspective. In our approach, similar candidate services are aggregated together as a unified resource, whose wide QoS spectrum can be easily manipulated by the end users to satisfy their requirements. Then they can personalize the services and, the composition occurs only at the presentation layer.

"A Prediction Mechanism of Adaptive Learning Content in the Scalable E-Learning Environment","C. P. Chu; Y. C.

Adaptive learning feature provides content specific to a student's learning style. Hence, the first step of adaptive learning is to identify the student's learning style and then to determine the appropriate learning content that corresponds to the individual students learning style. This paper proposes a mechanism to predict the adaptive learning content for each student. To prove the usability and availability of the proposed mechanism, this paper implements the proposed mechanism in a scalable e-learning environment. In the scalable e-learning environment, every student can share diverse learning contents distributed in different learning management systems through peer to peer technology. By means of the prediction mechanism, the adaptive learning content can be acquired at the student site in advance of its use. Hence, the waiting time for downloading learning content can be reduced and thus the learning performance is enhanced. Furthermore, the complexity of storage space is decreased since the student only needs to acquire the learning content corresponding to her/his learning style. In addition, this paper also uses the IRIS dataset and real student data to verify the accuracy of the prediction mechanism.","","POD:0-7695-2847-3","10.1109/AINAW.2007.43","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4224242","adaptive learning;e-learning;peer to peer.;prediction mechanism","Accuracy;Computer science;Content management;Education;Electronic learning;Electronic mail;Environmental management;Iris;Space technology;Usability","computer aided instruction;peer-to-peer computing;teaching","adaptive learning;e-learning;learning content;learning management system;peer to peer technology;prediction mechanism;student learning style;teaching quality","","4","","25","","","","21-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Notably, these systems support a similar development model in which coding the algorithm is temporally distinct from viewing and interacting with the resulting visualization. To explore the benefits of narrowing the gap between coding an algorithm and viewing its visualization, we have implemented ""What You See Is What You Code"", a novel, ""radically dynamic"" development model to facilitate learner-constructed algorithm visualizations. In this model, the line of algorithm code currently being edited is reevaluated on every edit, leading to the dynamic update of an accompanying visualization of the algorithm. Analysis of usability studies involving introductory computer science students suggests that the immediacy of the model's feedback can help novices to quickly identify and correct programming errors, and ultimately to understand their code's execution.","1943-6092;19436092","POD:0-7695-2443-5","10.1109/VLHCC.2005.72","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1509500","","Computer errors;Computer science;Dynamic programming;Feedback;Heuristic algorithms;Laboratories;Programming profession;Usability;Visualization;Writing","computer aided instruction;computer science education;program debugging;program visualisation;teaching","active learning;algorithm behavior understanding;algorithm code;code execution;computer science students;graphical representation;learner assistance;model feedback;pedagogical algorithm visualization;programming error correction","","5","1","19","","","","20-24 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such environments can provide unique opportunities for creating and delivering experiences that enhance online teaching and learning. Designing a user interface for such collaborative spaces presents several unique challenges. To enable productive interactions between users of such spaces requires that software designers choose what sorts of social interactions and cues to support such interactions within the collaborative space, and which to avoid. Design considerations are further complicated by the need to accommodate usability expectations created by users who are familiar with modern video game conventions while at the same time creating a user interface that provides an accessible path to the novice user of three-dimensional collaborative virtual environments. In this paper we examine how the user interface must explicitly address the boundary between private and public in a virtual collaborative social space, and propose a set of initial user interface conventions so that we can start the trial and error process of developing the optimal user interface for Croquet-based collaborative spaces to support learning and instruction.","1556-0082;15560082","POD:0-7695-2325-0","10.1109/C5.2005.33","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1419782","","Collaborative software;Collaborative work;Education;Games;Information technology;Online Communities/Technical Collaboration;Software design;Space technology;User interfaces;Vocabulary","computer aided instruction;groupware;human computer interaction;user interfaces;virtual reality","Croquet learning spaces;distributed multiuser social experience;user interface;virtual collaborative social space","","6","","10","","","","28-29 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition we investigate usability issues. The approach that we have taken for this investigation is through a study that involves students from different university departments who were asked to use both the mobile and standard desktop facilities of an educational system, so that we could compare usability issues among the two modes. As a result most students approved the ''new'' way of interaction with excitement and found mobile facilities useful and easy to use.

A series of five focus groups was conducted with practicing teachers, preservice teachers, and science librarians, drawn from different educational contexts (i.e., K-5, 6-12, college). Participants' expect that the added value of educational digital collections is the provision of: (1) 'high quality' teaching and learning resources, and (2) additional contextual information beyond that in the resource. Key factors that influence educators' perceptions of quality were identified: scientific accuracy, bias, advertising, design and usability, and the potential for student distraction. The data showed that participants judged these criteria along a continuum of tolerance, combining consideration of several factors in their final judgements.

International Conference on Information Technology: Coding and Computing","20020807","2002","","","95","99","An important parameter in evaluating data hiding methods is hiding capacity (Cohen et al., 1999) i.e. the amount of data that a certain algorithm can ""hide"" until reaching allowable distortion limits. One fundamental difference between watermarking (Cox et al., 1997; 1999) and generic data hiding resides exactly in the main applicability and descriptions of the two domains. In the digital framework, watermarking algorithms that make use of information hiding techniques have been developed and hiding capacity was naturally used as a metric in evaluating their power to hide information. Whereas the maximal amount of information that a certain algorithm can ""hide"" (while keeping the data within allowable distortion bounds) is certainly related to the ability to assert ownership in court, it is not directly measuring its power of persuasion, in part also because it does not consider directly the existence and power of watermarking attacks. We show why, due to its particularities, watermarking requires a different metric, more closely related to its ultimate purpose, claiming ownership in a court of law. We define one suitable metric (watermarking power) and show how it relates to derivates of hiding capacity. We prove that there are cases where considering hiding capacity is sub-optimal as a metric in evaluating watermarking methods whereas the metric of watermarking power delivers good results.","","POD:0-7695-1506-1","10.1109/ITCC.2002.1000367","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000367","","Computer science education;Computer security;Data encapsulation;Distortion measurement;Home computing;Information security;Power measurement;Steganography;Usability;Watermarking","copy protection;copyright;data encapsulation","copyright;data hiding;information hiding;law;metric;watermarking algorithms;watermarking power","","3","","23","","","","8-10 April 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of these are at the highest levels of system description and are therefore generally applicable across a range of development techniques. Consequently they provide a framework within which specific system development techniques can be described and assessed. The models are discussed with respect to an experimental methodology, BASE, being developed at the University of Ulster. Two significant aspects of this approach are: (i) placing the production or enhancement of computing systems in the context of `business improvement'; and (ii) emphasising the need to make change with respect to a `vision' of where improvement is leading.

For instance, the quality of the design can aid the development of new reasoning skills on the one hand and on the other it can affect the understanding of physical phenomena. From a pilot study conducted with the purpose of investigating how design and usability issues impact on the mathematics and science teaching-learning process in secondary schools in Mexico, we identify a number of problems that suggest the importance of considering these issues during the implementation of educational technology programs and during the evaluation of its outcomes, as these programs will ultimately determine the development of for example, national curricula and national education policies.","","POD:0-7695-0493-0","10.1109/HICSS.2000.926722","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=926722","","Computer science education;Educational institutions;Educational products;Educational programs;Educational technology;Mathematics;Paper technology;Physics computing;Physics education;Usability","computer aided instruction","Mexico;educational technology;educational technology programs;evaluation programs;national curricula;national education policies;reasoning skills;secondary schools;teaching-learning process;teaching-learning processes;technology-based implementation;usability issues","","0","","15","","","","4-7 Jan. 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have created some helpful tools around the Hartstone program that may be used for a performance evaluation and a rapid analysis of real-time applications. They give the possibility to understand the real-time responsiveness of applications using both real-time and standard operating systems in an uncomplicated way. We distinguish three different methods to compare performance and to check the theoretical results of scheduling analysis. The first is based on finding breakdown utilization points of process sets. The second method inspects the special overload behavior beyond the breakdown utilization point. This observation reveals a very interesting behavior of the system under overload conditions. Finally, we evaluate the performance based on a simulation of a real-world real-time application","","POD:0-7695-0134-6","10.1109/RTSE.1998.766516","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=766516","","Computational modeling;Delay;Distributed computing;Education;Electrical capacitance tomography;Information technology;Job shop scheduling;Operating systems;Real time systems;Visualization","computer science education;educational courses;operating systems (computers);performance evaluation;processor scheduling;real-time systems","C language implementation;Hartstone Uniprocessor Benchmark;LynxOS;Windows NT;application-oriented benchmark;breakdown utilization points;fixed-priority scheduling analysis;overload behavior;performance evaluation tools;process sets;real-time operating systems;real-time responsiveness;real-time systems course;simulation;standard desktop systems;teaching;usability","","4","","11","","","","1998","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Part of the project's core philosophy is to teach science by having students participate in the scientific method. The first of a series of planned modules has been developed to test such fundamental issues as Web usability, the incorporation of multimedia, overall module and site structure and learning effectiveness. The topic of the first module is the motion of the pendulum and the structure that the authors used guides students through three levels of experience. The first is a ""hands-on"" lab that utilizes readily available materials. A more ""refined"" lab experience then layers on more detail to the phenomena under discussion, and focuses on data acquisition test and measurement issues. The final section of the module is based on mathematical models and simulations (JAVA applets) and conceptually focuses on the most sophisticated aspects of the phenomena or their broader application.","0190-5848;01905848","POD:0-7803-5643-8","10.1109/FIE.1999.840464","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840464","","Computer science;Data analysis;Educational institutions;Internet;Mathematical model;Physics;Testing;Usability;Web pages;Writing","Internet;computer aided instruction;computer science education;engineering education;information resources;multimedia computing;student experiments","CAI;Internet Science Institute;JAVA applets;USA;Web usability;World Wide Web;data acquisition;lab-based learning;learning effectiveness;multimedia;science education;students","","0","","3","","","","10-13 Nov. 1999","10 Nov 1999-13 Nov 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Distance education materials can be presented either synchronously, creating the illusion of a classroom on the computer, or asynchronously, allowing the students access-on-demand. We describe the development of a system to solve part of the asynchronous education problem-delivery of pre-recorded multimedia lectures via a web browser. We built a demonstration system using off-the-shelf technology making it possible to make presentations using commercial tools and to display them on standard systems. We designed the system with lectures composed of ""slides"" accompanied by audio commentary. These presentations can be delivered via low-speed modem links-an important consideration in places without a well-developed infrastructure. We also believe that computer-based education is often so complicated to use that operation interferes with education. In order to avoid this, we evaluated a prototype system to obtain feedback about difficulties in operation and to correct them","0190-5848;01905848","POD:0-7803-6669-7","10.1109/FIE.2001.963717","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=963717","","Auditory displays;Computer displays;Computer interfaces;Computer science education;Distance learning;Educational technology;Graphical user interfaces;Internet;Multimedia systems;Telecommunication computing","computer aided instruction;distance learning;information resources;multimedia systems;online front-ends","Internet;Web-based lecture delivery;access-on-demand;asynchronous distance education;audio commentary;computer technology;computer-based distance education;computer-based education;graphical user interfaces;low-speed modem links;off-the-shelf technology;pre-recorded multimedia lectures delivery;slides;synchronous distance education;telecommunications;usability evaluation;web browser","","2","","19","","","","2001","10 Oct 2001-13 Oct 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The learning environments of today and tomorrow must handle distributed and dynamically changing content, a geographical dispersion of students and teachers, and generations of learners who spend hours a day interacting with multimillion-dollar multimedia environments. The new learning environments are moving beyond kindergarten through college classrooms to distance learning, lifelong education, and on-the-job training; they're entering the multifaceted universe of virtual worlds and ambient spaces. The articles in this special issue report novel, cutting-edge, intelligent learning environments. The systems not only have intelligent computational architectures but also are empirically tested on humans. Empirical research is of course essential to test system fidelity in delivering the intended pedagogy and to assess learning gains, usability, and learner satisfaction. This article is part of a special issue on intelligent educational systems.","1541-1672;15411672","","10.1109/MIS.2007.70","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4287269","3D educational virtual environments;adaptation;adaptive testing;affective computing;collaborative intelligent tutoring systems;constraint-based ITS;personalization;student modeling","Animation;Computational intelligence;Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Educational institutions;Intelligent agent;Intelligent systems;Multimedia systems;System testing;Virtual environment","","","","1","","","","","","July-Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
