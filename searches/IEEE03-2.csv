Thus, the research questions in this study are as follows: What kinds of activities applied in a classroom setting can increase students’ communication competence? What are the effects of active learning strategies on students’ communication apprehension? Situating the case: Understanding communication apprehension and its relationship with communication competence is necessary for designing effective communication courses for management information systems students. How the case was studied: This study implemented active learning strategies in three classes to develop students’ communication competence while decreasing their communication apprehension level. Surveys were administered to students to evaluate their level of communication apprehension. About the case: Adopting psychoeducation intervention strategies from occupational therapy, this study implemented different active learning strategies to further develop students’ communication competence as well as decrease their communication apprehension. The results show that the levels of communication apprehension among these classes decreased significantly following adoption of these strategies.

Skills involving analysis, evaluation and synthesis are considered to be of higher order, requiring diverse learning and teaching methods than the customary learning of facts and concepts. HOTS involves the learning of complex judgmental skills such as critical thinking and problem solving. They are activated when individuals encounter unfamiliar problems, uncertainties, questions, or dilemmas. Successful application of the skills results in justifications, decisions, performances, and products that are valid within the context of existing knowledge that encourages continued growth in other intellectual skills. The major difficulty in attaining HOTS among engineering students is that we still pursue the traditional approach of teacher-centered classroom where the teacher is an active transmitter and the students are passive recipients. To achieve HOTS among engineering students we establish an Active Learning Environment (ALE) with the effective usage of Information and communication technologies (ICT). Active learning is embodied in a learning environment where the teachers and students are actively engaged with the content through discussions, problem-solving, critical thinking, or a multitude of activities that encourage interaction among learners, instructors and the material. Supporting to active learning, the ICT usage lends itself to more student-centered learning. This paper demonstrates the strategies to achieve HOTS through various ALE strategies like Role Play, Jigsaw, Brainstorming, debate, Mind map etc for Concept Understanding and Group assignments, combined mini projects, Discussion on Topics, Quiz, and Puzzles for Concept Applying. We have applied various learning strategies and assessed the student outcomes. HOTS is achieved by developing applications or products, with improved inter personal skills and lifelo- g learning skills. The evidence for the effectiveness of ALE among engineering students is showed by great improvement in their academic result, placement record and research interests","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1062-2; POD:978-1-5090-1063-9","10.1109/MITE.2016.020","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8049054","Active Learning Environment;Higherorder thinking;Information and communication technologies;student-centered learning","Engineering students;Information and communication technology;Problem-solving;Tools","engineering education;teaching","ALE;HOTS;ICT;active learning environment;diverse learning;diverse teaching;engineering education;engineering students;higher-order thinking skills;information and communication technologies;intellectual skills;learner interaction;student-centered learning;teacher-centered classroom","","","","","","","","9-10 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Government has put a major focus on using E-services for easing processes in most, if not all of their Ministries. Governments have quickly realised the benefits to be reaped from early adoption of technology. With the advent of globalisation, better awareness and communication has paved the way for developing strategies to enable a citizen centric approach in the provision of ubiquitous on-line services to the population. This country wide approach to empower citizens by the rolling out of on-line services in the areas such as education, health, civil service, transport, judiciary, business, finance and security, to name a few, has been more than beneficial.

This is one that faces numerous challenges in terms of the effective management when introducing a change for pedagogical practice that involves the ubiquitous use of computing and ICT against a global user base that is influenced by known and unknown barriers to technology adoption. It is suggested that that with a history of organizational change considerations being a pre-dominantly strategic business related construct, and technology related change being a predominantly project managed or service model construct, that a traditional CM or project approach may not adequately address many barriers to technology adoption. As has occurred in other business/IT related interactions such as the Information systems strategy triangle, learning using technology requires a clear marriage of the technological managerial and pedagogical domains. Organizational, Business, IS, and education strategy all need to interact synergistically in order to move forward with technology use for education. The purpose of this project was to conduct a study that focused on the broad context of technology barriers faced by students using technology around a Moodle based online learning environment. The underlying objective was to examine the interaction between change management activity and student perceptions of both technology barriers and change focusing on encouraging the adoption of technology for learning. The project created and presented a typical open source Moodle based virtual Learning Environment (VLE) in a BYOD situation, to a group of 35 second year university students in the form of activities and a quantitative and qualitative survey of the barriers and interactions.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1560-3; POD:978-1-5090-1561-0","10.1109/IACC.2017.0156","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7976890","E-learning;HEI context;Technology Adoption;change Management","Analytical models;Business;Context modeling;Education;Guidelines;Mobile communication;Tools","Bring Your Own Device;Internet;computer aided instruction;further education;management of change;public domain software","BYOD situation;HEI context;Moodle based online learning environment;change management guidelines;open source Moodle based virtual learning environment;organizational change considerations;project managed construct;service model construct;strategic business related construct;technology adoption;technology enhanced learning;technology related change","","","","","","","","5-7 Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This demand requires that higher education institutions prepare their graduates adequately, not only in technical skills, but also in terms of the so-called soft skills. In this paper, we describe a strategy that is being implemented, in recent years, in two higher education Information and Communication Technologies courses. In it, several practices were adopted that we believe will lead to a successful preparation of students, not only on a technical level, but also in terms of the acquisition of knowledge and best practices regarding best teamwork methodologies. Employers' feedback has been essential for the implementation of this strategy, since it has allowed us to evaluate how it facilitates the integration of recent graduates, after being recruited, and the issues that influence that integration. We can conclude that, for a successful integration, there is an important contribution, not only from the technical knowledge and abilities they acquired, but also from a diverse set of behavioral aspects related to interpersonal relations, motivation, attitude towards challenges, among others. The approach we propose is aimed at guiding the training of finalist students in order to facilitate their integration into a future work environment.

In the context of virtual education, a question that remains to be solved is associated with the level of motivation possessed by the students during the course. Usually, at the School of Engineering in the University of Medellín, this issue is tackled through activities such as chats and forums. Mostly, these activities are not enough to motivate the student in the activities related with the learning process. This work proposes two motivation strategies based on gamification and constructivism. These strategies are validated in a course called programming fundamentals, taught to all bachelor degrees given in the School of Engineering. Results obtained through the experiments suggest that proposed strategies improve the student's performance and satisfaction in the course. Therefore, when teaching at the virtual scenario, using Information and Communication Technologies in the educational environment is not only the way to contact the student, it is the mean to develop pedagogical-didactic approaches that finally enrich the educational process and consequently motivate the student to perform well.","1548-0992;15480992","","10.1109/TLA.2017.7932706","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7932706","computer science;gamification;virtual courses","Context;Education;IEEE transactions;Information and communication technology;Programming profession","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational institutions;further education","Colombia;University of Medellín;computer science;constructivism;gamification;information and communication technologies;learning process;motivation level;motivation strategies;pedagogical-didactic approach;programming fundamentals;school of engineering;virtual education","","","","","","","","June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Virtual environments as well as learning strategies are implemented in order to guide online learners in achieving their objectives. However, it was found that there is a lack of cognitive interactions. Therefore, this research's aim is to assess the gaps between the desired learning type of interactions and the actual learning activities of the learners. As methodology, a questionnaire was designed to identify synchronous interactions, done both individually and in teams. The participants in the survey are eighteen online learners, enrolled in a completely online master's course in France. With the help of activity theory the existing system is assessed and most of the learners claim that they go through the prescribed learning activities. The type of interactions obtained after compilation of the questionnaire refers to learner-tools, learner-content, tutor-learner as well as learner- learners interactions.

These disparities may not only obstruct access to the most appropriate rehabilitative care, but may contribute to psychological problems, reduced quality of life, and unsuccessful return to meaningful community participation. Information and communications technology (ICT) when combined with robotic technology can enhance the accessibility of rehabilitation in low-resource, capacity-constrained settings. In this paper we introduce a low cost, limited supervision, portable robot (H-Man) designed for upper extremity rehabilitation. A usability and feasibility study indicates that out-patient robotic treatment with the H-Man leads to positive improvements in arm movement, and that the system is usable and well accepted by key stakeholders.

Learners who have had no previous practical experience in defining requirements may follow a recommended procedure in order to elicit requirements. We have implemented two types of role-play training - with and without software agents' support. Twelve undergraduate students from the School of Computer Science at the Tokyo University of Technology participated in an experimental assessment of these two types of role-play training. The results of a subsequent questionnaire survey and portfolio evaluation of the goal model diagrams developed by the students showed that their requirements modeling skill levels had improved.

"Academics' experience of teaching Open Ended Group Projects: A phenomenographic study","M. Voogt; Chuan Sheng Chen; N.

The tool contributes to the development of `soft' skills essential for students' future career needs. This paper reports on a phenomenographic study that investigates the research question: What are the ways in which academics teaching Open Ended Group Projects experience teaching the course? Previous studies, using the phenomenographic research approach, have offered insights into academics' conceptions of science learning and teaching. However, there are no studies that investigate the experiences of teachers who use OEGP in their classes. This is the first study, that asks academics using an OEGP how they experience teaching these courses. Students enrolled in a course on computing education research conducted the small-scale study at Uppsala University, Sweden. In order to answer the research question, a theoretical sample was selected with a wide range of relevant population characteristics (e.g. background, prior experience, gender, and age). The semi-structured interview questions focused on understanding of OEGP, the learning objectives of OEGP, strategies for teaching these learning objectives, and the teacher's experience in teaching through OEGP. The results indicate that teachers see their role within OEGP as a coach and that the variation between experiences lies in what is intended to be coached. This variation is presented in a hierarchy (the outcome space). Categories focus on: the team, discipline, problem solving skills, learning and motivation. We also look at the first-hand experience of a student in an OEGP course and discuss the teachers' perceptions of students' experiences of OEGP. The implication for teaching is that a teacher needs to reconsider the way he or she teaches more often in OEGP than in regular courses. There are two reasons for this. First, teaching OEGP is based less on- teaching content knowledge and more on teaching skills. Secondly, OEGP deals with a `real problem', and aspects of the problem continuously change. Teachers are recommended to aim for reaching a higher category, indicating a deeper level of experience, and to use the experience of coaching OEGP in other courses as well. The importance of metacognition (reflection on action) and discussion with other teachers who have experience in teaching OEGP is highlighted.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1790-4; POD:978-1-5090-1791-1","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757474","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757474","Open Ended Group Project (OEGP);phenomenography;teaching experience","Collaboration;Context;Data analysis;Education;Engineering profession;Information technology;Interviews","computer science education;educational courses;engineering education;teaching","OEGP;Sweden;Uppsala University;academics experience;computing courses;computing education research;engineering courses;information technology courses;metacognition;open ended group projects;pedagogical tool;phenomenographic study;teaching skills","","","","","","","","12-15 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It was possible because advances like the Internet and the development of Learning Management Systems (LMS) were improved increasingly. However, the large amount of information available is not sufficient to ensure the development of future learners in technical disciplines, such as Computer Science and Engineering disciplines. High dropout rates and failure in this type of course are common in Brazilian Universities and few initiatives are taken to improve the situation. Nevertheless, the labor market demands of its workers technological training, especially in informatics. By coordinating a work group to develop the project “Integrated Student” for two consecutive years at the Federal University of Espirito Santo (UFES), we proposed innovative teaching strategies used both for the development of the course participants and for the tutor's academic lives. Under a constructivist look on Piaget's view it was found that we need to enhance one main ability of students, teachers and tutors of technological courses: mediation. The methodology used was the basis for the creation of a model of distance learning courses in technical areas, to be started in the coming years. We approach, particularly, in the progress made in the preparation of tutors, students of Computer Science and Engineering, which, in most cases, decided to continue their academic lives with the completion of a Master in Information Technology area or even start his career as teachers.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6149-5; POD:978-1-5090-6150-1; USB:978-1-5090-6148-8","10.1109/LACLO.2016.7751745","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7751745","design education;e-Learning;mediation","Computer aided instruction;Computer science;Computers;Electronic learning;Mentoring;Operating systems","distance learning;educational courses;educational institutions;learning management systems;teaching","Brazilian Universities;Federal University of Espirito Santo;Internet;LMS;Piaget view;UFES;computer science;course participant development;distance education;distance learning courses;engineering disciplines;information technology;innovative teaching strategy;integrated student project;labor market;learning management systems;mediation;scientific knowledge;technological distance learning;technological training","","","","","","","","3-7 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper attempts to assess the readiness of educators and schools in the migration from “Informatique” to “ÉcoleNumerique” for young learners at primary levels. A case study was drawn from two french private schools X and Y in Mauritius. To achieve this aim, the TAM model was adapted as guideline to analyze some imperative factors affecting educators in adopting e-teaching tools. A combination of both quantitative and qualitative methods was used to collect data. A questionnaire was distributed to primary school educators to gather findings of their current adoption of e-education tools and the Information Technology (IT) officers were interviewed to investigate the present schools' IT infrastructure, the level of computer skills/knowledge and the factors affecting educators in adopting the e-teaching tools. The survey findings have contributed to look for possible further e-tools requirements to be integrated in the new school technological plan. Findings show that although the educators are equipped with the basic ICT skills and knowledge towards this new migration, yet there are some additional critical success requirements for its proper deployment. Recommendations are based on the implementation of robust and reliable network connection architecture in the classrooms and an updated training strategy for the continuous development of the educators.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0706-6; POD:978-1-5090-0707-3","10.1109/EmergiTech.2016.7737371","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7737371","e-teaching tools;ecole numerique","Business;Computers;Conferences;Electronic publishing;Multimedia communication;Training","computer aided instruction;computer literacy;continuing professional development;human factors;teaching","Ecole-Numerique;ICT skills;IT infrastructure;Mauritius;TAM model;computer knowledge;computer skills;continuous development;digital schooling;e-teaching tool adoption;french private schools;information technology;network connection architecture;primary schooling;qualitative methods;quantitative methods;updated training strategy;young learners","","","","","","","","3-6 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The implementation of e-Education initiatives faces huge challenges in countries with low and medium human development levels due to budget constraints and lack of infrastructure, among other limitations. In this context, massive open online courses (MOOCs) might be a useful tool to offer educational opportunities to citizens, provided the right strategies are envisioned and applied. This study has two parts. In the first part, we selected a sample of countries covering all levels of human development index (HDI) and found an inverse correlation between HDI and population growth. We also found that countries with low and medium HDI have low education indexes and need to improve their primary education completion rates, secondary education enrollment, and tertiary education enrollment. In the second part, we performed a SWOT analysis to identify the internal and external factors of MOOCs that influence their ability to be used for e-Education in countries with low and medium human development. Based on these factors, we defined a set of strategies. As future work, we plan to evaluate the strategies proposed with the collaboration of public educational institutions and government organizations.","","Electronic:978-3-9075-8912-0; POD:978-1-5090-2090-4","10.1109/ICEDEG.2016.7461713","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7461713","HDI;Human Development Index;MOOCs;Massive Open Online Courses;e-Education;e-Government","Africa;Correlation;Education;Electronic government;Indexes;Sociology","computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational institutions;government data processing;information technology","HDI;MOOC;SWOT analysis;e-education;e-government;government organizations;human development index;human development levels;information technologies;massive open online courses;primary education completion rates;public educational institutions;secondary education enrollment;tertiary education enrollment","","","","45","","","","March 30 2016-April 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Learning loss varies based on subject matter, with summer learning loss associated with math at the higher end of the scale. Greater effects of summer learning loss are generally associated with lower income families. Additionally, minorities and women remain underrepresented in the STEM Fields. Based on this information and desires to engage with community in effective and scholarly ways, founders of the Lafayette College Summer camp established a summer STEM education venue for young children in 2011. Recognizing that inclusion of the Arts added interest to our general theme and education modules, and served to enhance our education messaging, STEM Camp became STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, ARTS, and Math) Camp in 2014. An additional highlight of this camp is the fact that the leadership, ideas, design and organization of all modules is a production led by two undergraduates, one student majoring in Arts-Humanities and a second majoring Science-Engineering. A group of volunteers made up of faculty, local K12 teachers, college and high school students, and community members, support all camp activities throughout the four-day event.

A Semantic Web-based software tool called Instructional Module Development (IMOD) System, currently under development, is built upon a framework for outcome-based course design. It uses Semantic Web technologies to provide intelligent interactions with the users, dictate a course design process in conformance with the underlying framework, checks for omissions and inconsistencies in the design, provides feedback to the user on their course design, and recommends relevant assessment and pedagogical approaches along with help on how they are implemented. In this paper, we present an ontology called IMOD-Ont that aims at describing and formalizing entities in the domain of instructional design and is used by the IMOD system. IMOD-Ont ontology complements existing metadata schemas and linked data approaches in the field of technology-enhanced learning that focus on describing learning resources and educational content that is available on the Web. The goal is to make the semantic data generated from course designs created through the IMODS tool available as linked education data on the web.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0662-5; POD:978-1-5090-0663-2","10.1109/ICSC.2016.98","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7439363","ontology design; instructional design; semantic web; STEM education; technology-enhanced learning","Education;Metadata;OWL;Ontologies;Semantics;Standards","computer aided instruction;educational courses;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","IMOD-Ont;STEM;World Wide Web;course design development;educational content;information technology;instructional module design;instructional module development;learning resources;linked education data;ontology;research-based pedagogical strategy;semantic Web-based software tool;technology-enhanced learning","","","","12","","","","4-6 Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The MOOC brings a revolution of higher education. It brings the concept of flipped classroom which reverses the traditional educational arrangement by delivering instructional content, often online, outside of the classroom. How to use the flipped classroom to support the interaction between teachers and students, to stimulate students' learning interest, and to implement the ""student-oriented"" education system, are important issues. In this paper, we study a teaching mode which is based on the MOOC's flipped classroom mechanism for college English teaching.

Changes and processes in the field of information technology and telecommunications are fast, wide spread and revolutionary, even aggressive. This analysis is based upon the experiments and data of Service Centre of Széchenyi University. The key findings of this paper is the conclusion that for the higher education institution is vital for applying infocommunication tools for reaching the cognitive entities, the young generations. The paper focuses on the development of communication channels, online communication and social media, furthermore tends to give an overall picture of the rapidly growing role of social media as a tool among Hungarian higher institutions. The financial position of institutions depends more and more on customer behaviour. Customer behaviour has an influence on the higher education market; it has an effect on the choice of institution and also on future target groups. So it is significant for these institutions to pay attention to consumer expectations and communicate effectively with their consumers, using the latest and the most advanced information communication technologies. It is particularly important because the universities' target groups are mostly the Y and Z generations into whose everyday activities modern info communication technologies are embedded. In the frame of our paper we give an overview of the trends and long term features - such as digitalization, info-communication, and social media - on marketing communication tools at Széchenyi University. The case study shows the multifaceted nature of the problem, the range of possible tools and their application. Due to the labour market needs Széc- enyi István University strengthens relations with the business sector and broadens the range of teaching and research services provided by them. In the case study we can follow the development of communication channels/instruments; the digital evolution and the phenomenon that the social web has become the most important (strategic) platform for communicating with the young generations; overall trends in interactive communication and online communities, and the emergence of interactive channels; social media, networks and online videos. The universities have to employ professionals with social media skills and they have to create communicating strategies for different generations. We have a real case about how younger ""always online"" communication professionals formulate the core requirements; and how we can integrate the communication centre with the newest info communication tools, such as mobile communication: applications. We can conclude that as the World Wide Web becomes more and more influential, social media has become the most important tool of marketing communication for universities to reach the public.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8129-1; POD:978-1-4673-8130-7; USB:978-1-4673-8128-4","10.1109/CogInfoCom.2015.7390641","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7390641","Case Study Introduction;Higher Education;Marketing Communication;Non-business Organistations;Y and Z Generation","Communications technology;Education;Market research;Media;Organizations;Presses","computer aided instruction;consumer behaviour;educational institutions;further education;market research;social networking (online)","Hungarian higher institutions;IT telecommunication technologies;Service Centre of Szechenyi University;coginfo application;communication channels;customer behaviour;higher education institution;information technology;marketing communication;marketing systems;nonbusiness organization;online communication;social Web;social media","","","","12","","","","19-21 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Teaching programming needs careful selection of different supportive pedagogical methods to help students progress. When the teaching does not meet students' expectations, frustration occurs. Programming is usually introduced to Information Technology students in their first year of study. Different types of new students exist - some are prepared for university studies and others struggle. Students' engagement affects students' success or failure rates in programming. Only engaged students can allocate time on doing programming related activities. Engaged students who come to class with positive outlook are more likely to achieve better. Frustration can hinder the process of learning and it can occur when teaching methods don't appeal to students or when students don't receive timely feedback on their programming errors. From the literature, learning strategy, collaboration, self efficacy, time availability, interest, support, scaffolding, availability of devices and resources and comfort level were identified as the leading attributes that affect engagement in programming.

In this perspective, MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) have been promoting research in the technological and educational areas, since they serve as an emerging and powerful knowledge-building platform for anyone, anytime and anywhere. However, limitations in the current development of MOOCs have required the search for strategies to support their personalization in order to enhance the users' learning and others skills, such as the ability to self-regulate and to work in a collaborative way, and not just to replicate the content already taught in the traditional classroom, through videos or other passive learning activities. Considering the need for changes in the MOOC's pedagogical model, this research aimed to investigate and promote a reflection about the possibility of using Flipped Classroom Teaching Model principles to design this type of virtual and massive environment. The paper starts with a description of MOOCs, Flipped Classroom and some related works used to support personalized learning in MOOCs. As a result of this investigation, we present some conceptual strategies for educators to design MOOCs from FC ideas and principles. We envisage that adaptation and incorporation of concepts of Flipped Classroom, already applied in face-to-face classroom, can also act as an effective intervention to support personalized learning in MOOCs, helping students to take the active role in their own process acquisition of skills and knowledge construction.","","Paper:978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344146","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344146","Flipped Classroom;Learning Design;Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs);Personalization","Collaboration;Collaborative work;Context;Education;Games;Online services;Videos","computer aided instruction;educational courses;information technology","ICT;face-to-face classroom;flipped classroom teaching model principles;flipped classroom theory;information and communication technologies;knowledge construction;knowledge-building platform;learning experiences;massive environment;massive open online courses;passive learning activities;personalized design;skills acquisition;virtual education;virtual environment","","1","","39","","","","21-24 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the advances of information technology, some virtual microscopy systems (VM systems) have been developed over years for educational purposes. The VM systems have been proven in the literature to be useful and helpful for students' learning. However, currently, most VM systems just try to mimic the physical microscopes and there is still a lot of room to improve their usefulness for educational purposes. In this paper, we discuss what kinds of features and technologies a VM system should have in order to support various pedagogical strategies.

Based on our experience teaching college students in these environments, we have noted that on entering school, generally, individuals demonstrate limited background knowledge of a variety of computer related technologies. Students begin with a technical disadvantage that represents a readily exploitable attack vector for identity thieves. Because of the experience deficit, the hazard of identity theft is significant with possible severe detrimental outcomes for the student victim. In addition, the negative impact on the society as a whole is substantial. Methods that reach beyond traditional formal computer or network security instruction in the classroom and extend information assurance education across disciplines are needed. We have explored this direction at the university and have worked on strategies to educate students about identity theft. The interdisciplinary programs outlined here span the curriculum. In addition, we suggest community outreach programs that extend the scope of influence of information assurance education beyond the university to include surrounding at risk populations.","2158-3404;21583404","Electronic:978-1-4244-9149-0; POD:978-1-4244-9150-6","10.1109/ISTAS.2011.7160601","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160601","Internet crime;Trojan-downloaders;identity theft;identity thieves;information assurance education;key-logging;phishing;privacy issues;rural and urban student populations;social networks","Business;Computers;Education;Industries;Security;Sociology;Statistics","computer crime;computer science education;educational institutions;hazards;teaching","IA;college student teaching;computer related technologies;extend information assurance education;formal computer instruction;identity theft education;identity theft hazard;interdisciplinary approach;network security instruction;rural population;university;urban population","","1","","20","","","","23-25 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The education on MNT requires specific curricula and methods due to its multidisciplinary character on one hand and the declining numbers of students willing to study the “hard” sciences on the other. The paper considers a joint MEng/MSc University degree course in MNT under the ""Romanian-Bulgarian Services Centre for Microsystems and Nanotechnology"" project. It is developed by two of the project partners: National Institute for Research and Development in Microtechnologies - IMT Bucharest and Ruse University ""Angel Kanchev"", and University Politehnica of Bucharest. In the paper analyses supporting the development of the course is presented. The basic clusters of information required for the development of the course are specified and structured. More particularly a portfolio of technologies and services of interest for the business were defined as well as design and managerial skills required for the engineers. Exemplary structure of the proposed MNT course is also discussed. Three major blocks of modules are suggested: core, specific, optional. They are followed by an Individual Project. It is also envisaged that the course would cover several key areas of MNTs such as: IC Materials and Systems; Bio Materials and Systems; Manufacturing Materials and Systems. An indicative content of the modules is also presented and discussed from the point of view of the aims of the course; learning outcomes; targeted intellectual, practical and t- ansferable skills; teaching and learning patterns; assessments methods. In general the course will provide an understanding of micro/nano manufacturing processes and systems. It will enable the engineers to appreciate the role of efficiency, process and materials selection in the design and production of MNT products. It will assist the design and manufacturing engineers in specifying the essential requirements for the products, including material and dimensional/geometrical properties and the usage of appropriate standards.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6730-1; POD:978-1-4673-6731-8","10.1109/ITHET.2014.7155686","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155686","higher education;micro electro-mechanical systems;micro-systems technologies;micro/nano technology","Atmospheric measurements;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Nanobioscience;Particle measurements;Solid modeling","educational courses;educational institutions;electronic engineering education;manufacturing processes;micromechanical devices","EU 2020 Strategy;IC materials;IC systems;IMT Bucharest;MNT course;Millennium project;Romanian-Bulgarian transborder cooperation;Ruse University Angel Kanchev;University Politehnica of Bucharest;assessments methods;bio materials;bio systems;design skills;dimensional-geometrical properties;hard sciences;joint MEng-MSc University degree course;learning outcomes;learning patterns;managerial skills;manufacturing materials;manufacturing systems;micro manufacturing processes;microsystems and nanotechnologies;multidisciplinary character;nano manufacturing processes;practical skills;specific curricula;teaching patterns;training opportunities;transferable skills","","0","","13","","","","11-13 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proenza","","Public Access ICT across Cultures:Diversifying Participation in the Network Society","20150617","2015","","","","","In a bid to address weaknesses in its education system, in 2005 the Government of Cameroon adopted a strategy that introduced information technology into the school curriculum and established multipurpose community telecenters (télécentres communautaires polyvalents [TCPs]) to help overcome shortcomings such as a lack of educational materials in rural communities. In this study, we examine the self-reported academic performance of secondary school students interviewed in five of the thirty-four TCPs set up to date. We find that students who study hard and are motivated to learn generally acquire Internet skills in the TCPs. Among mid- and upper secondary students, the evidence further suggests that, beyond study effort, having access to the Internet gives students a performance edge. Nevertheless, being motivated to learn and spending long hours studying remain keys to academic success and outweigh any advantage that access to the Internet or computers may confer. Furthermore, there is some evidence suggesting that spending too much time at a TCP may thwart academic achievement. The government is to be commended for taking the initiative, but it is disappointing that so few TCPs have managed to fully function over a sustained period of time.","","97802623285","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=7121168.pdf&bkn=7120884&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","2015","","","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

In other words, engineering institutions need to strive for continuous improvement in the various sub-components of the system namely, input, resources-physical, information, human, financial and energy, curriculum and instructional processes, management, output, interaction with world of work and feedback mechanism. India has third largest system of education in place but still faces problems of access, equity and quality. The major challenges before the country include: converting demographic advantage to demographic dividend, increasing Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) at higher and technical education level, providing equal access to technical education in different states & diverse groups, providing competent human resource for manufacturing sector, rural development & transformation and infrastructure development. Technical education system comprises of 8462 institutions offering degree in engineering and technology and 3524 institutions offering diploma in engineering and technology with an intake capacity of 3.4 million students. These institutions are facing severe criticism due to decline in quality. Government of India has taken a number of initiatives in this direction. For example, these initiatives include making National Board of Accreditation an independent organization from the regulatory body AICTE, launch of mission teacher and training, sub-mission on polytechnics under coordinated action for skill development, providing impetus to National Mission on Education through ICT etc. to improve the quality of higher and technical education in the country. Strategies need to be adopted at institute level to improve quality and buil- excellence such as improving curriculum and instructional processes, linkages with world of work, optimal utilization of resources, creating research culture, formulating staff development policy etc. in the system of technical institutions.

The use of technology has enabled organizations to develop more effective approaches to design, develop and provide products and services. This has resulted in increasing dependence of organizations on IT solutions which has in turn created a need for availability of skilled IT personnel for effective operational continuity within organizations. Universities and other forms of tertiary institutions play a key role in developing skilled IT personnel. They adopt various industry-education aligning approaches to designing and developing IT educational programs. There seems to be a consensus that skills development strategies and educational programs must ensure consideration of realistic and relevant needs for IT skills. Internationally recognized skills frameworks are one of the strategic approaches for industry-education alignment. A pilot study examined feasibility of aligning learning outcomes of a portfolio of courses with skills identified in Skills Framework for Information Age (SFIA). The study indicated that overall mapping of existing technology education courses/programs to SFIA is feasible. At the same time, the study highlighted a number of key requirements for ensuring that the mapping exercise if effective.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7672-0; POD:978-1-4799-7673-7; USB:978-1-4799-7671-3","10.1109/TALE.2014.7062622","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062622","Education and Industry Alignment;Educational Reform;IT Skills;SFIA;Skills Frameworks","Conferences;Education;Electromagnetic interference;Human computer interaction;Kuiper belt","computer science education;educational courses;organisational aspects;personnel","IT education alignment;IT educational programs;IT solutions;Information Technology;SFIA;Skills Framework for Information Age;course portfolio;industry-education aligning approach;learning outcomes;operational continuity;organizations;skilled IT personnel;skills development strategies;skills framework;technology education courses;technology education programs;technology solutions","","1","","23","","","","8-10 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The CIRAX project aims to promote and consolidate a teaching community which should be active in the creation, updating and sharing resources, and learning practices. The tool for achieving this goal is a repository-in-collaboration where resources could be shared, well-catalogued and well-managed. In light of the experience, we have identified the factors that influence sharing and reusing resources and which have been tested on university teaching staff of introductory math courses. Among these factors, we have observed a high degree of sharing practice but constraints on reusing, due to prioritization of time and a lack of information regarding open licenses. The first year results allow us to establish essential lines of action in order to consolidate and enhance this experience within the mathematical teaching community at the Catalan university system: a) simplify the prototype and its workflows; b) articulate the shared resources in a normalized and clear way; c) develop strategies for consolidating the community and dissemination of information; and d) enhance the institutional recognition of teaching practice.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4799-3922-0; POD:978-1-4799-3923-7; USB:978-1-4799-3921-3","10.1109/FIE.2014.7044357","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044357","CIRAX;Catalan University System;Open Educational Resources;interuniversity collaboration;repositories;teaching quality","Collaboration;Communities;Educational institutions;Materials;Mathematics;Prototypes","educational courses;educational technology;information dissemination;mathematics computing;teaching","CIRAX pilot experience;Catalan university academic staff;Col·laboratori interuniversitari de recursos d'aprenentatge en xarxa;influence sharing;information dissemination;information technologies;institutional recognition;interuniversity collaboration;introductory math courses;knowledge-sharing communities of practice;learning practices;mathematical teaching community;open licenses;openness movement;teaching practice;university teaching staff","","0","","22","","","","22-25 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In fact, computer scientists struggle to agree on a definition of their discipline, and perhaps the only term common term to all existing definitions is that of computational thinking. This paper reports on an investigation into perceptions about computer science occurred during a series of professional development workshops for Australian Digital Technologies teachers. These workshops aimed to promote the computer science discipline by providing skills and resources necessary to teach computer science and computational thinking.

"Presentation 1. Information governance in the age of big data","S. Earley","Earley & Assoc., USA","2014 IT Professional Conference","20150205","2014","","","1","3","Organizations have understood the value of their structured data - mostly financial transactions - since the first mainframes were developed in the 40's. Data quality issues have always been a challenge and the increasing numbers of applications consuming and producing structured transactional data has grown exponentially. Unstructured information has been given less significance and strategic importance and therefore fewer resources and less attention on the part of leadership. All of that has changed and is changing faster than anyone imagined. Unstructured content is what humans produce. They create the documents: strategies, proposals, support documents, marketing content, white papers, engineering specifications, etc. that form the intelligence and core knowledge capital of the enterprise. Many organizations have left business units to fend for themselves and “go figure it out” with little guidance or support. These has led to terabytes of content that people cannot find their way through and that leaves the organization open to risks, liabilities and costs of e discovery. According to the Minnesota Journal of Law, Science & Technology, a gig of data costs $30,000 in e discovery costs. The cost of storage is ten cents. The problem is that the enterprise does not understand the hidden costs of not making data accessible and usable - lost time, lost IP, inefficiency, poor customer service that can lead to lost customers, slower growth, etc. As newer collaboration technologies are deployed, they expose the bad habits and sins of the past. Deploying a new search engine shows that the content is not curated. Standing up a new content management application like SharePoint reveals the haphazard shanty town of an information architecture with inconsistencies in models, terminology and applications. Today's landscape of marketing and customer experience technologies is complex and interconnected and requires those upstream knowledge processes th- t produce unstructured content as the fuel. Customer experience entails everything that happens before you purchase (marketing, education and outreach), when you purchase (e commerce with product content and data), and after you purchase (self-service systems and knowledge bases that support the call center). This is the customer lifecycle and at each step in the process systems and tools need to be harmonized as they gather information about the users using attribute models that are consistent and that serve the business and the customer. They take content and data as input and then output more data. One applications exhaust is another applications fuel. Organizations are also purchasing data streams to enrich their internal information sources. Social media is an enormous virtually untapped reservoir of data about customers and what they think about organizations. This can be mined for sentiment and to gauge marketing effectiveness. Increasingly, much of this is being placed into the hands of the marketing organization. In fact, a study by Gartner Group said that by 2017 the CMO will spend more money on IT than the CIO. What all of this means is that information, content and data governance need to be considered as part of a whole and not as separate initiatives. Elements of good information governance include: Deployment and Operationalization; Alignment with User Needs; Business Value; Buy-In and Change Management; Sponsorship and Accountability Leads to the following outcomes: Manages conflicts in business priorities (between initiatives, business units, drivers, etc); Allows for ongoing input from various stakeholders and constituencies in order to evolve capabilities with the needs of the business; Prioritizes efforts and allocation of resources; Assigns roles and responsibilities with accountability to critical functions; Takes into consideration various levels of maturity in the organization - no one size fits all; Ensures that investments in systems, proc","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4141-4; POD:978-1-4799-8858-7","10.1109/ITPRO.2014.7029280","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7029280","","Big data;Fuels;Information architecture;Information management;Organizations;Standards organizations","Big Data;electronic commerce;financial data processing;organisational aspects","Big Data;IT;SharePoint content management;attribute models;business units;data governance;data quality;data streams;decentralized decision making;e-commerce;e-discovery costs;financial transactions;information architecture;information governance;internal information sources;resource allocation;search engine;social media;structured transactional data;unstructured content;unstructured information;virtually untapped reservoir","","0","","2","","","","22-22 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The growing influence of technologies of all kinds on the work of managers, firms, and industries, and conversely, the rising importance of industries as transnational institutions influencing the behavior of its members, often in collaboration with parochial interests groups and even regulators and political leaders, should force managers to challenge some old assumptions and lead to relevant strategies and new managerial behaviors.","","97811190051","10.1002/9781119005148.ch3","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=7027457.pdf&bkn=7022513&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","2015","","","","","Wiley-IEEE Press","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

"A comparative study on different pedagogy strategies in engineering interdisciplinary","","","2014 International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning (ICL)","20150122","2014","","","413","419","Existing pedagogy strategies in engineering interdisciplinary have been refined and new strategies are developed. The students would take equal benefit by developing their understanding as a part of their academic studies whilst gaining valuable scientific level learning experience. Over the recent decades, different scholarly strategies have become common as a consequence of numerous developments in the engineering learning interdisciplinary such as Science and Engineering Ethics (SEE), Excellence in Engineering Education (ExcEEd), Project-Based Learning (PBL), Service Learning (SL), Socratic Method (SM), Life-Cycle Analysis (LCA), Information and Communication Technologies in Engineering Education (ICTEEd), Open Ended Group Project Framework (OEGP) engineering pedagogies. It has already been scrutinized that each pedagogy approach has specifically its own effects and limitations, and no one approach is suitable for every engineering interdisciplinary so it is very essential to make a comparative analysis on different engineering pedagogy strategies and design an approach on global basis that will constitute all the features. This paper presents a comparative assessment of aforementioned pedagogy strategies in engineering interdisciplinary along with their characteristics, features and future scope. More specifically, this paper reports the careful use of each strategy to provide the most invigorating and supportive environment for students to continue exploring their potential. This paper aimed to enhance engineering capability through active student participation as well as openness to diversity of designs which are supported through innovative uses of technology in the engineering education.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4437-8; POD:978-1-4799-4436-1; USB:978-1-4799-4438-5","10.1109/ICL.2014.7017808","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7017808","Engineering pedagogy;comparative research;engineering interdisciplinary;teaching strategies","Collaborative work;Communications technology;Communities;Conferences;Engineering education;Ethics","engineering education","ExcEEd;ICTEEd;LCA;OEGP;PBL;SEE;SL;SM;Socratic method;academic studies;engineering capability;engineering interdisciplinary;excellence in engineering education;information and communication technologies in engineering education;learning experience;life-cycle analysis;open ended group project framework;pedagogy strategy;project-based learning;scholarly strategy;science and engineering ethics;service learning","","0","","49","","","","3-6 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the advancement in technology and cost effective solutions, HIS adoption among the hospitals has increased substantially in recent years. Various project management tools are available which helpful in effective planning and project monitoring. In spite of effective planning and implementation in phase manner, the concern remains regarding the challenges faced during implementation and usage of HIS. These challenges includes Technical Challenges like Security of Data, Unauthorized access, confidential information, integration of Medical Softwares to avoid duplicate entry and Administrative Challenges like involvement of stakeholders, user acceptance, lack of ownership etc. This can be subdued either by utilization of data entry operators or through offline and duplicate entries, but such implementation does not achieve the purpose of HIS. Apart from good project management, there are various other factors such as involvement of users, effective trainings, awareness program, secure and role based application, compliance to industry standards for easily integration with other applications etc., which increase success factor of implementation.

Therefore, it is required to implement comprehensive reforms in sectors such as education, infrastructure, healthcare, information technologies and telecommunications, among others. Some of the difficulties that prevent Mexico to improve its competitiveness level are the lack of incentives that drive for an increase in the school-study grades of the population, asymmetry in the coverage and service offering in telecommunications that have concentrated their commercial activity mainly on the main capital cities. In order to attain a coherent strategy and promote reforms in the sector to take advantage of Convergent Technologies available, we will analyze different related aspects such as the adjustments needed in regulations, the availability of Broadband Internetworking Technologies (BBINT), the expansion of the Telecommunications Industry (TI) infrastructure, mobile mainly, the promotion mechanisms for innovation and the existence of good and fair conditions for research and development on this BBINT arena, just to mention only a few of them.","","CD-ROM:978-963-8111-68-5","10.1109/NETWKS.2008.6231313","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6231313","","Abstracts;Broadband communication;Business;Logic gates;OFDM;TV","","","","0","","","","","","Sept. 28 2008-Oct. 2 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The gap between what is existing and what is supposed to be for the self-regulation and improvement processes is not entirely clear to face these challenges. The effective use of information technology in higher education requires good and new techniques as well as rational strategies. The reform of higher education through strategies based on data analysis of current situation will affect the overall performance of transitional state and will shape new paradigms in higher education system development in Egypt. This research has objective to develop a model of Composite index (CI) based on a set of key performance indicators (KPI) commensurate with the nature of higher education institutions in Egypt. The outcomes of the composite index aim to measure overall performance of institutions and provide unified ranking method in this context. KPIs are determined as description of key success factors related to institutions sustainability. These KPIs are classified into main areas and sub-indicators. Within this scope, the indicators were weighted via Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method according to their significance levels. Pairwise comparison survey template and database web application were developed to collect narrative responses, apply algorithm and extract results. The research study was conducted with 40 professors from 19 renowned universities in Egypt as education experts.

New methods demand new organisation alternatives that, in turn, require new educational policies and put pressure in current assumptions of education itself. Distance Education is a challenge by itself. It places new demands both to the learner, but also to the facilitator. A set of seven dimensions for a distance learning environment were identified, which positively impacts the setting of learning experiences: (1) access tools; (2) technology experience; (3) habits and study skills; (4) human factors and life style; (5) goals and guidelines; (6) learning preferences; (7) personal characteristics [1]. This paper defends that the learners, when asked about their characteristics, taking into account different issues of their familiar, personal and professional life, available technology resources, technology skills, as well as motivation and learning preferences, provide an information set that, if turn available to facilitators, allow to both players (learners and facilitators) the mechanisms that ease the adoption of learning strategies, that enhance the possibility of a well succeed learning experience. To accomplish the research goals, an empiric study was conducted in the context of a Distance Education (DE) institution, taking a sample of 214 learners, with diverse characteristics. The data analysis allows the confirmation of the position validity and proves that it is possible to know in advance the distance learners more important characteristics and of the surrounding environment as means to access potential success and rate failure.

New technologies fundamentally changed the way they interact with knowledge so the traditional approach to learning and teaching is no longer sufficient. In order to make the learning environment more interactive and enable students to learn easier and faster, modern teaching techniques need to be applied. There are many different teaching techniques that have emerged from the integration of technology in education such as: flipped teaching, whole brain teaching, gamification, social media, etc. Flipped teaching encourages students to study the course material before class by using readings, pre-recorded video lectures or research assignments. Class time is reserved for active learning strategies. Whole brain teaching helps stimulate both sides of the brain and emphasizes active learning in which students repeat core information and practice basic skills through humor and games. Gamification is a game-based learning technique that allows students learning through the use of games. Nowadays students are always connected to some social network. These students are easily motivated to engage with social media in the classroom. Experience from the School of Electrical Engineering in Zagreb shows that the use of different modern teaching techniques is making learning interesting and teaching more effective.","","CD-ROM:978-953-233-081-6; Electronic:978-953-233-077-9; POD:978-1-4799-5657-9","10.1109/MIPRO.2014.6859643","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6859643","","Computers;Educational institutions;Games;Internet;Media","computer aided instruction;computer games;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online);teaching","Zagreb;active learning strategy;cell phones;computers;core information;course material;educational process;electronic devices;flipped teaching;game-based learning technique;gamification;learning environment;modern teaching techniques;modern teaching techniques application;pre-recorded video lectures;research assignments;school of electrical engineering;social media;social network;technology integration;whole brain teaching","","0","","10","","","","26-30 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different technologies have been employed in various disciplines within the educational sector. Studies have shown that technology can enhance teaching and learning experiences. Augmented Reality (AR) is a new technology with vast potentials and great pedagogical value that offers new methods for education. AR enables the overlaying of computer-generated virtual information into the real environment in real time. Thus, researchers believed that the AR has provided new opportunities for designing engaging learning environments. Although the AR may improve educational outcomes, the main factor is to understand the process of designing the AR to support learning activities. Thus, various instructional strategies such as collaborative learning, were considered when designing an AR learning environment. Collaborative learning permits students to engage with other students and the educational content at the same time, resulting in a deeper understanding and higher motivation. Because educational research concerning collaborative AR is still in its infancy, this paper intends to review the literatures concerning collaborative AR, its previous usages and its potential in educational context.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3592-5; POD:978-1-4799-3593-2; USB:978-1-4799-3591-8","10.1109/LaTiCE.2014.23","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821833","Augmented Reality;collaborative learning;education","Augmented reality;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Education;Games;Global Positioning System;Three-dimensional displays","augmented reality;computer aided instruction;groupware;teaching","AR learning environment;collaborative augmented reality;collaborative learning;computer-generated virtual information;education;globalization;innovation;teaching","","3","","35","","","","11-13 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

National policy documents give ICT a high priority in development of the country's educational system. Curricula have been revamped to accommodate for increased role of ICT in the society and education. Also educational institutions have explicated high expectations of ICT in the process of ""massification of education."" Several research studies, however, have showed little change in the classrooms. Surveys and case studies have showed that on the way from policy documents to strategy level and implementation level, something gets missing. The lack of ICT in education is clear in primary and secondary school, which is unsurprising, given that majority of schools also lack electricity and basic facilities, including proper classrooms, tables, and books. This study sets out to investigate, using thematic interviews of secondary school teachers in Tanzania, what processes and support structures do teachers consider to be lacking in terms of ICT supported education. Informants from teacher training colleges were also involved in order to bring out viewpoints from teacher training. The results confirmed a large number of earlier results, divided to six categories: school policy, implementation and administration on the school level, access to ICT, leadership and management, school culture, and teacher training. A number of new factors were also pinpointed: teachers' lack of awareness of government policies and documentation on several levels, lack of pedagogical readiness for e-learning and blended learning, and cultural concerns. Concerning what should come first, there was a chicken-and-egg-problem: it makes little sense to invest in rapidly aging ICT infrastructure and facilities if there is no human capacity to make use of those investments, and it makes little sense to invest in human capacity if there is no technol- gical infrastructure to put quickly aging technical know-how into immediate use.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3592-5; POD:978-1-4799-3593-2; USB:978-1-4799-3591-8","10.1109/LaTiCE.2014.31","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821841","Classroom Activities;Culture;Educational Technology;ICT management;Information and Communication Technology (ICT);Tanzania;Teacher education;Teachers' expectations;Teachers' experiences","Computers;Educational institutions;Government;Internet;Interviews;Training","computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational institutions;government policies;information technology;teacher training","ICT supported education;Tanzanian secondary schools;blended learning;classroom teachers;cultural concerns;e-learning;educational curricula;educational institutions;educational system development;government policies;information and communication technology;national policy documents;pedagogical readiness;teacher training colleges","","1","","56","","","","11-13 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As we can see today, most of the teaching and learning activities at all level of studies have been integrated with various forms of technologies, particularly with the Information and Communication Technology. This technology often relates to online learning, which usually involves the use of various forms of 2-dimensional applications. However, the recent times have seen many educational institutions around the globe shifting their interest towards the use of a new application for online learning, known as the virtual world. The virtual world has unique capabilities and unlike its 2-dimensional counterpart, it can generate a 3-dimensional social learning space, amplify the sense of presence and immersion of students, and support various forms of communications and interactions. Utilizing these capabilities with proper instructional strategies in conducting online learning activities can greatly enhance the online learning experience. Without a doubt, the virtual world has been considered as an important tool in modern education practice, especially for collaborative learning. To obtain a comprehensible view of this trend, this paper reviews some of the latest studies which have involved collaborative learning in virtual world. Four main topics were extracted from the reviewed studies: categories of virtual worlds, collaborative strategies used in the studies, focus of each study, and challenges of collaborative learning in virtual world.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3592-5; POD:978-1-4799-3593-2; USB:978-1-4799-3591-8","10.1109/LaTiCE.2014.18","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821828","Collaborative learning;Multi-user virtual environment;technology in education;virtual world","Avatars;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Computers;Education;Second Life;Virtual environments","computer aided instruction;educational institutions;teaching;virtual reality","2-dimensional social learning space;3-dimensional social learning space;collaborative learning strategy;education world landscape;educational institutions;information and communication technology;instructional strategy;online learning activity;online learning experience;teaching;virtual world","","0","","32","","","","11-13 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

According to the prediction of the European Commission in 2015 this sector will be lacking 900 000 professionals. While annually more than 100 000 jobs or employment opportunities are created by the ICT industry, there is a lag in relevant professionals.” (Nemzetközi összefogás az it-s szakemberhiány ellen, 2013) Moreover, this trend is not only impacting Europe as in 2006 58 000 work visas were available in America for ICT professionals. (McCormack, 2010) Although it has become clear that only education can provide an effective answer to the problem of the lack of professional experts, only business firms offer IT and ICT related training opportunities and higher education institutions do not provide programs aiming to meet relevant employer demands. Consequently, any improvement of the present situation requires a familiarity with the concept of ICT along with an overview of is history and continually increasing role in the education process. Thus the present effort aims to answer the following questions: As a direct connection can be established between ICT and Information Technology, since when can ICT be considered as an educational tool? What did the conceptual system of ICT replace? How did ICT supersede the concept of Educational Technology? Can ICT be merely viewed as an all-round education tool, or there is more to its application? “Educational tools or devices are objects, materials, instruments and technological equipment, facilitating the realization of pedagogical goals and vigorously promoting the school-based learning process, specific knowledge acquisition efforts and the direct (in some cases indirect) familiarization with reality via their capability of transmitting, recording, and storing information in an effective way.” (Fodor, 2008) Since when has ICT fulfilled such roles in the - ducation process? “The application of information and communication technology in education primarily manifests itself in a cybernetic, system in addition to a communication theory based planning and organization strategy of the learning and information acquisition process guaranteeing the optimalization of the accessibility and the reception of information with the use of modern information carriers, methodologies, and technologies.” (Kis-Tóth, 2008. p.3.) The present research effort focused on the total spectrum of articles published in full textual form between 2000 and 2010 in the periodical titled Educational Media International. Frequency analysis or computerized content analysis, a branch of quantitative content analysis was the main research method. The main goal of the inquiry was not to perform a statistical analysis on the totality of expressions, rather an examination of the occurrence of such terms as ”Information and Communication Technology,” “Information Technology,” “IT,” and “ICT.” Consequently, the research samples consist of the words of the text, or “mutually independent components of the source language flow.” (Krippendorff, 1960, p.60) The research effort includes the investigation of the textual context of the aforementioned terms via the standard keyword in context (KWIC) method providing a report on the terms:”Information and Communication Technology,” ”Information Technology,” ”IT,” and ”ICT.” It is expected that the research will facilitate the determination of the proliferation time of the given expression, which due to the unique nature of the respective periodical can be dated from the time when education started to provide a response to the challenge of technological development.

The theoretical and methodological approach underpinning the study is Constructivist, Contextual and Meaningful (Construcionista, Contextualizada e Significativa - CCS), making use of input from the studies of Papert, Valente, Schlünzen, Almeida and others, which presuppose valuing different ways of teaching and learning by using the TDIC. These ways of teaching imply a reorganization of pedagogical practice through the development of skills and promotion of strategies where all students (including those with disabilities), have the right of access and to stay in school, learning with quality. UNESP is committed to the training of elementary school teachers and, along with the Universidade Virtual do Estado de São Paulo (UNIVESP), offers Degrees in Pedagogy UNIVESP / UNESP, and is currently training 1004 (one thousand and four) teachers working in basic education in the state of São Paulo. Held in a semipresential modality, the course curriculum is organized in modules and themes / disciplines from broad areas of undergraduate training. There are Articulator Axes in these modules and, among these, the Articulator Axis: Inclusive and Special Education - 120 hours/class (linked to Block 2: Didactic of Contents). The focus of this research is directed to the preparation and monitoring of the development of this articulator axis. The research questions are: Is it possible, in the process of training teachers in a course of semipresential- Pedagogy, to guide them to work using TDIC in a CCS approach to generate an inclusive school? How does the Articulator Axis enable teachers to apply the knowledge constructed in this context? In order to answer these questions, the general goal is to analyze the process of teacher training aimed at teaching the fundamentals of Inclusive Education in a perspective of working with TDIC projects using a CCS approach. The methodological nature is of a qualitative intervention type, and the subjects of semipresential training comprise a sample of 160 students from the UNIVESP / UNESP Degree in Pedagogy and 8 guiding discipline (tutors responsible for 4 classes where students are enrolled). Analysis of preliminary data available in the Virtual Learning Environments of selected classes indicate that the discussion on curricular and teaching strategies was expanded in the development of Articulator Axis; students developed plans for inclusive education in transdisciplinary perspectives and began to look further into such issues as the use of TDIC and working with cross-cutting themes, namely, meanings attributed to theory and practice. It is expected that it will be possible to characterize the effective contributions of the proposal and the impacts of the development of inclusive education plans, by the end of the study, featuring not only an approach to teaching but also to CCS training.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3216-0; POD:978-1-4799-2753-1","10.1109/CICEM.2013.6820172","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820172","Constructionist;Contextual and Meaningful Approach;Teacher Training","Conferences;Context;Councils;Educational institutions;Media;Training","educational courses;teacher training;teaching","TDIC;UNESP;articulator axis;communication digital technology;constructivist;contructionist;course curriculum;cross-cutting themes;distance education;doctoral thesis;inclusive education plans;inclusive school;information digital technology;pedagogical practice;pedagogy UNIVESP;semipresential pedagogy;semipresential training;teacher formation;teacher training;teaching strategies;virtual learning environments","","0","","38","","","","1-4 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

More concretely, we present the work that is being developed for the creation of a set of learning activities for the creative arts and cultural education curricula using ICT and Web 2.0 tools. The study was based on the principles of the development methodology approach (Van den Akker, 1999). Following this perspective, and using a focus group strategy, we present here the strategies created to catch the view of a group of art teachers previously selected on the basis of knowledge and experience of using technology in their teaching practice. Assuming the importance of involving teachers in the process of design and development of learning activities, we selected and worked during three months with a group of twelve experienced teachers in the use of the potential of information and communication tools, in particular in the use of Web 2.0 features. The main questions to answer with this joint reflection were: a) In the area of creative arts what kind of learning activities can benefit from the potential of digital technologies available today?; b) How should those activities be organized and presented to less motivated teachers in order to motivate them to use digital technologies in their practices? The preliminary results suggests the idea of structuring activities not individually, but in a ""creative project integrator"" as a way to bring inexperienced teachers from the arts and culture areas to meet the pedagogical potential of digital technologies and to integrate them more effectively in his or her teaching practice. In fact, the expert teachers interviewed suggest a consensus that the proposed activities should be organized around a common educational goal, albeit with - ufficient flexibility that allows inexperienced teachers build or adjust their own content and context. We will conclude with a discussion and a reflection about teacher training strategies based on some suggested examples of imaginative and creative ways and proposals to organise the learning contexts using ICT tools in the case of the arts and culture subjects.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3216-0; POD:978-1-4799-2753-1","10.1109/CICEM.2013.6820166","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820166","ICT;Learning design;creative arts;development methodology;digital tools","Art;Conferences;Context;Councils;Proposals;Training","Internet;art;computer aided instruction;history;teacher training","Comenius multilateral program;European Union;ICT tools;Web 2.0 tools;arts subjects;creative arts;creative project integrator;cultural education curricula;culture subjects;digital activities;digital technologies;experienced teachers;focus group strategy;information and communication tools;learning activities;learning contexts;learning environments;pedagogical potential;teacher aids;teacher training strategies;teaching practice","","0","","11","","","","1-4 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The importance of having the intellectual curiosity, ability to effectively apply the acquired knowledge/skills and job expertise becomes even more crucial in the highly competitive, fast-paced workplace. As a result, students are increasingly pressured to excel and succeed in this compelling academic journey. Globalization and rapid advancements in technology have facilitated many new e-teaching tools and social media platforms to cope with changing trends in students' receptivity to information and communication styles, making it even more essential for educators to continually review the education system in order to convey knowledge to students more creatively and effectively. Consequently, the instructional approaches which influence the behavioral aspect of learning that motivate and stimulate an individual's interest in learning and effective understanding with acquiring of knowledge are essential to examine. With deeper reflection and analysis on the behavioral learning of students, instructors could better comprehend the needs and expectations which facilitate providing their students the necessary inputs. Through this instructional article, a learning framework “Perspective Transformation of instructors in Pedagogical Strategies” is proposed to facilitate more effective learning among business students. The conceptual framework proposes a shift from instructor-centric to learner-centric in the instructional roles, design of curriculum and assessments, learning culture and feedback process, by adopting five essential strategies: (1) Performing different instructional roles for varying types of instructional approaches (2) Shift in learning culture: embracing creative learning; (3) Prof- ssional soft skills training; (4) Assessments based on three fundamentals of understanding, critical thinking and application; (5) Continuous process of correspondence between instructors and students coupled with reflection in terms of formative and summative feedback; These learning approaches within the proposed framework have been applied in the classroom context at Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Business School, in Semester 2 Annual Year 12/13. They have resulted in good course assessment and examination outcomes with positive feedback from students. This framework continuously allows avenues for further exploration in terms of optimal and effective pedagogical approaches by incorporating practical solutions to calibrate and embrace the rapid changing learning needs and demands.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3216-0; POD:978-1-4799-2753-1","10.1109/CICEM.2013.6820164","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820164","Active learning;Changing learning needs;Creative teaching and Instructional approaches;New generation learners","Business;Conferences;Context;Councils;Educational institutions;Media","commerce;educational computing;educational courses;further education;management education","behavioral learning;e-teaching tools;education system;effective learning;higher education;instructional article;instructional roles;instructors;knowledge acquisition;knowledge-based economy;learning framework;new generation business students;pedagogical strategies;perspective transformation;positive feedback;professional soft skills training;social media platforms;summative feedback","","1","","29","","","","1-4 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Panchoo","SAFE, Univ. of Technol., Port Louis, Mauritius","2013 Africon","20140306","2013","","","1","7","As human manpower is an important asset for Mauritius, strategies are deployed and incentives are given to encourage lifelong learning. Thus, tertiary institutions in Mauritius are increasingly developing courses with the aim of reaching a larger student population through a flexible mode of learning. However, it is well known that distant learners' motivation fades away and that the rates of dropouts have not considerably decreased across the years. To give adequate supports to the distant learners, tertiary institutions are keeping up with the emerging technologies, from radio, television, audio/video conferencing to the World Wide Web. The aim of this paper is to assess the institutions' contributions to distance learning with regards to both technological and pedagogical supports. The methodology opted is of qualitative nature and it includes investigation through desktop research, informal interviews and testimonials of students. Six distance education institutions in Mauritius were chosen for this research. Interestingly, results show the institutions use emerging information and communication technologies (ICTs) for their teaching and learning process. However these technologies are primarily used as a communication tool rather than a pedagogical supporting tool. These supports are thus more oriented towards giving administrative help to the students. This research brings a valuable contribution to a doctoral research with the aim of designing an online learning model to assist students in their learning process.","2153-0025;21530025","Electronic:978-1-4673-5943-6; POD:978-1-4673-5942-9; USB:978-1-4673-5941-2","10.1109/AFRCON.2013.6757822","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6757822","distance learning;distance learning institutions;information and communication technology;online learning environment;pedagogical support;technological","Computer aided instruction;Educational institutions;Face;Internet;Media","continuing professional development;distance learning;educational courses;educational institutions;human factors;incentive schemes;teaching","ICTs;Mauritius;communication tool;courses;desktop research;distance education institutions;distance learning;distant learner motivation;flexible mode;human manpower;incentives;informal interviews;information and communication technologies;learning process;lifelong learning;online learning model;pedagogical support assessment;student population;teaching process;technological support assessment;tertiary institutions","","0","","28","","","","9-12 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the past several years there has been much activity and research involving the use of technology in education. This is especially true for diverse learners, who have difficulty learning with the traditional pedagogies used in teaching. Even though many of the anecdotes and suggested methods in this research study are focused on applications for students with autism, these same strategies can be effectively applied to a variety of diverse learners. The specific information regarding students with autism not only enables students to learn the content in a variety of formats, but also helps to prepare them to have fruitful, productive lives after their schooling and for the rest of their days. Results of studies have indicated that students become more interested and actively engaged in their classes, and have a higher level of retention than students in traditional online and onsite classes. It is important to empower students to become active, involved learners, and provide them with the incentives to achieve academic success. This is a work in progress, and future renditions will include not only anecdotes dealing with youngsters with autism, but also with those diagnosed with deafness and those who are severely mentally challenged with down's syndrome and other disorders.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2402-8; POD:978-1-4799-2403-5","10.1109/GHTC.2013.6713653","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6713653","autism;diverse learners;retention;technology","Avatars;Communities;Databases;Educational institutions;Media;Virtual environments","computer aided instruction","academic success;diverse learners;education;online learning;student retention;students with autism;technological devices;virtual worlds","","2","","17","","","","20-23 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While investigation of metacognitive strategies used by students is now an established research topic within Computer Science and Information Technology education, the study of personal epistemology is relatively undeveloped. This is so despite there being significant epistemological issues associated with learning the subject itself, such as those concerned with the way in which programming exercises change from convergent to divergent problems, or the process by which software project management problems very quickly become ill-defined. In this paper, we describe a preliminary investigation into the personal epistemology of two cohorts of computing students. We review some models of personal epistemological development and describe an empirical study in which we investigated the dimensions of epistemological beliefs of two cohorts of computing students.

M-learning not only provides educational oppurtunities through handheld devices, but also facilitates just in time information required at the right time and right place. Though m-learning provides mobility and instant access to education, there are some implementation challenges and issues like limited processing capability and small screen display that needs researchers attention. Keeping in view the latest trends in Information, Electronics and Communication Technologies(IECT) and the increased usage of mobile phones in India, this paper discusses mobile learning technologies, opportunities and challenges for success-full implementation of m-learning. It is observed that most of the students in India use low cost mobile phones that too with different hardware capabilities and features. Researchers and developers in education domain should consider these mobile capabilities and challenges before developing m-learning video content. Pilot experiment was conducted to study different mobile video presentation styles, file formats and their playback capabilities using students mobile phones. Students from various finishing schools were involved in carrying out this experiment. Based on pilot results, instructional design strategy and mobile video content development guidelines were formulated catering to the requirements of student community in India.","1738-9445;17389445","Electronic:978-89-968650-1-8; POD:978-1-4673-3148-7","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6488212","Instruction Design;Mobile Learning;Mobile Video;Ubiquitous Learning;Video Content","Educational institutions;Mobile communication;Silicon;Transform coding","computer aided instruction;content management;mobile computing;multimedia systems;video signal processing","IECT;India;Information, Electronics and Communication Technologies;d-learning;distance learning;e-learning;education domain;educational oppurtunity;electronic learning;file format;finishing school;handheld device;hardware capability;instruction design;instructional design strategy;m-learning;mobile computing technology;mobile learning technology;mobile phone;mobile video content development guideline;mobile video presentation style;mobility;playback capability;processing capability;small screen display;student centric approach;student community","","0","","10","","","","27-30 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Burress","National Instruments, Austin, TX USA","2011 Future of Instrumentation International Workshop (FIIW) Proceedings","20130311","2011","","","71","74","Data is power, assuming you know how to use it. The organizations that will be most successful over the next decade are those that recognize this simple fact. The advantage provided by data that has been transformed into useful information is undeniable: information derived from measurement data can be used to drive differentiation, optimization, and innovation. The future's biggest data challenge lies in effectively managing acquired data to give context to what is otherwise just a series of numbers across thousands of files. Instrumentation hardware vendors have accelerated data collection rates so quickly and enabled engineers and scientists to break through data rate and resolution-barriers so rapidly that today, data is coming in at a truly blistering pace. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the rate of education on proper data storage, management and post-processing techniques. As a result, many organizations have been forced to devise their own schemes for data storage and management since they've effectively been left to their own accord. As a further consequence, many groups within the same organizational entity have adopted conflicting data strategies; this fractured outcome makes it nearly impossible to yield efficiency gains from data collaboration and knowledge sharing. After a brief introduction to the significance of data in the world today and the challenges that engineers and scientists currently face, this presentation will educate the audience on several technologies and techniques that provide a more modular, scalable approach to data management and yield the following benefits: Acquired data will gain context: descriptive information stored throughout the data acquisition and processing life cycle makes data traceable, trackable, usable, and logical to store. Acquired data will be searchable: data mining makes it easy to locate the data that you need, when you need it. Acquired data will be easier to process: from analysis to reportin- , data management reduces the many roadblocks in data processing, particularly as data sets grow in size.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5836-1; POD:978-1-4673-5835-4","10.1109/FIIW.2011.6476827","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6476827","","Context;Data acquisition;Data mining;Databases;Instruments;Memory;Software","data acquisition;data analysis;knowledge management;organisational aspects;storage management","data acquisition;data collaboration;data collection rates;data management technique;data post-processing technique;data processing life cycle;data storage technique;data strategies;differentiation;innovation;instrumentation hardware vendors;knowledge sharing;large data set analysis;large data set management;measurement data;optimization;organizational entity;resolution-barriers","","1","","","","","","7-8 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Today's workforce in tomorrow's smart grid: Bridging the growing gaps","S. Varadan","","2012 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting","20121110","2012","","","1","1","Summary form only given. In the light of the ongoing activities related to the “smart grid”, the perception that today's utility workforce is woefully inadequate and not up to par has gained considerable bite. As the discussions around smart grid have evolved, the industry, espoused by the US-DOE, has reached a consensus and formally defined the requirements for tomorrow's smart grid. Yet, it is not clear what exactly is expected of tomorrow's workforce. Should there be an emphasis on power system engineering, communication technologies, green generation technologies, basic sciences, hardware, software, engineering management, or plain vanilla “soft” skills? Present trends in the industry including the aging asset base, aging workforce, integration of renewable and sustainable resources - all in the background of Smart Grid, make the discussions around what is expected of the future utility work force even more complicated. University faculty and industry personnel are trying to figure out the answers to the questions above and common themes are slowly emerging as there is no definitive consensus on the expected needs of the future utility workforce. Even so, the concept of holistic education and critical thinking seem to be recurring themes at all levels. Consensus about the importance of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is another point of convergence. Implementation of ICT in various business processes and the effective breaking down of silos is an underlying theme in leveraging critical data out of which meaningful information, and knowledge, may be extracted to effect local change but with global consequences. This paper provides a critical view of the gaps that need to be bridged to transition today's utility workforce in the wake of tomorrow's anticipated smart grid needs. Advertised utility positions, such as Manager, Smart Grid and Technology Integration Strategy and Systems Engineer, Power Systems & - mart Grid will be examined in detail as a means to develop a better sense of understanding of what, and how, utilities are doing to bridge the perceived gaps in today's and tomorrow's utility workforce. Efforts at leading universities, technical schools and government agencies (such as CEWD and NSF) are described as well. Certificate programs and new course curricula addressing a more holistic approach are presented. Another important aspect of these efforts is the way in which these new courses are delivered as technology has changed the way in which workers may be trained, or retrained, using the concepts of on-line and long-distance learning programs. These “learn at your own pace” courses are gaining popularity along with more traditional time-bound courses delivered in a class-room setting as more and more people are being drawn towards a career in the “electric” energy business.","1932-5517;19325517","Electronic:978-1-4673-2729-9; POD:978-1-4673-2727-5; USB:978-1-4673-2728-2","10.1109/PESGM.2012.6344686","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6344686","Smart Grid Training;Utility Workforce Needs","Aging;Business;Communications technology;Educational institutions;Industries;Smart grids","computer aided instruction;distance learning;educational courses;power engineering computing;power engineering education;smart power grids","ICT;US-DOE;aging asset base;aging workforce;business processes;communication technology;electric energy business;government agencies;green generation technology;information and communication technology;long-distance learning programs;online learning programs;power system engineering;sustainable resources;technology integration strategy;tomorrow smart grid;utility workforce","","1","","","","","","22-26 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This research study investigates the concept of business/IT alignment within the environment of a tertiary education institution, specifically, to identify challenges experienced in achieving alignment and steps that can be taken to improve alignment. A conceptual model was developed to investigate the various factors impacting on business/IT alignment. This model suggests that an assessment of: the strategy formulation processes employed at the institution; the organizational culture at the institution; and the institution's alignment maturity using strategic alignment maturity criteria will enable the determination of factors inhibiting/enabling alignment. The findings revealed that achieving business/IT alignment is still a pervasive problem within the tertiary education sector, with a number of obstacles inhibiting alignment. Strategy formulation was found to be largely top-down with IT strategies having little input towards shaping organizational strategies. Aspects of the organizational culture, particularly relating to innovation, risk-taking and team-orientation needed to be improved in order to facilitate improved alignment. In addition, assessment of the educational institution in terms of alignment maturity criteria revealed areas for improvement particularly with regards to communications, competency, partnership and scope and architecture maturity.","2159-5100;21595100","Electronic:978-1-890843-25-0; POD:978-1-4673-2853-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6304284","","Educational institutions;Industries;Information technology;Organizations;Technology management","business data processing;educational administrative data processing;innovation management;risk management;strategic planning;team working","business-IT alignment improvement;information technology unit;innovation management;institution business units;institution strategic alignment maturity criteria;organizational culture;organizational strategies;pervasive problem;risk-taking;strategic management;team-orientation;tertiary education institution;top-down strategy formulation","","0","","17","","","","July 29 2012-Aug. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This article identifies the new skills which must be improved by the various actors of an innovative project, in order to ensure both the evolution of the individual and the organization. It then presents in which ways experiential learning strategies can be used in this context. Indeed, by observing cognitive mechanisms and social interactions in knowledge construction, we propose an ICT (Information and Communication Technology) platform for long life change management, which combines e-assistance and work practice activities. The piloting of activities, organized by the project manager and a virtual coach integrated into the platform, is made possible thanks to knowledge modeling presenting R&D project managerial expertise related to different actors profiles and skills.

Information technology plays a major role in the future of education, as they break geographical barriers and make educational content widely available. Knowledge collaboration is possible by creating virtual classrooms by interconnecting lecturers to geographically scattered students. Making educational material, such as tutorials and recorded lectures, available worldwide through high-storage infrastructures. Digitalizing and making books available through high-storage infrastructures. But this E-learning system requires huge investment for high-storage infrastructure. Some educational organizations and research institutes cannot afford expensive investments. On the other hand, in most of the organizations, there are large amounts of underutilized computing power and storage existing. Data Grid connects underutilized secondary storage of machines and provides huge secondary storage. It enables resource sharing among the geographically distributed users and resources. Therefore the institutes which do not have sufficient budget can make use of Data Grid efficiently. In this paper we have presented that how Grid computing can be used for inexpensive collaborative E-learning. Data replication increases availability, reliability of data and allows fast access to data. Replication reduces bandwidth consumption and congestion over communication line. Therefore replication is the major issue in Data Grid. Replication strategies determine when and where to create a replica of the data. A good replication strategy should ideally minimize file access time, reduce network congestion and minimize job execution time to improve performance of Data Grid. We strongly believe that the technological revolution that the grid is about to bring will definitely change the way that people dea- with information and, ultimately, knowledge. In this sense, grid computing and e-learning form a perfect match.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0726-1; POD:978-1-4577-0725-4","10.1109/ICTEE.2012.6208636","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6208636","Computational grid;Data Replication;Data grid;Grid computing","Bandwidth;Collaboration;Distributed databases;Electronic learning;Grid computing;Reliability","courseware;electronic publishing;grid computing;groupware;information retrieval;knowledge management;reliability;resource allocation;software performance evaluation","bandwidth consumption reduction;communication line congestion reduction;data access;data availability;data grid performance improvement;data reliability;data replication;educational content;educational material;educational organizations;electronic books;file access time minimization;geographically distributed resources;geographically distributed users;geographically scattered students;grid computing;high-storage infrastructures;inexpensive collaborative e-learning;information access;information technology;job execution time minimization;knowledge collaboration;knowledge sharing;network congestion reduction;research institutes;resource sharing;secondary storage;unused resource exploitation;virtual classrooms","","1","","19","","","","3-5 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ability to accurately choose the right education and training paths leading to the acquisition of the right competences required for a given job position, as well as the capability to properly select human resources based on precise job requirements are becoming more and more key factors to success. Nevertheless, the comparison of education opportunities generally requires a manual analysis of huge qualification descriptions and course syllabi, whereas staff selection (or job seeking activities) often relies on non-automated processes mainly based on an extensive check of applicants' curriculum vitae (or of possible job offers). The above tasks are extremely time consuming and, given the large amount of information to be considered, they also risk to provide unsatisfactory results. In this paper, the above issues are addressed in the perspective of semantic technologies. In particular, a web-based application is presented, which exploits ontological descriptions and tag cloud-based visualization strategies to generate a direct representation of the overlap between learners' needs and existing education and training paths, as well as between job seekers' profiles and company requirements.

"Considerable factors of incorporating PDAs to medical education","R. Luanrattana","Dept. of Bus. Inf. Syst., Assumption Univ., Thailand","2011 International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training","20110915","2011","","","1","8","Personal digital assistants (PDAs) have become a popular tool among physicians and medical trainees. PDAs are used for various purposes by healthcare professions and students. However most of these users are physicians, and the devices assist them in patient tracking, documentation, clinical decision making in order to decrease the number of adverse events and enhance their learning. PDAs seem to be a valuable tool in both the medical profession and education. However, the influence factors for incorporating PDAs into medical curriculum have yet to be evaluated and determined. Therefore there is a need to conduct this study for the incorporation of PDAs to medical education. Aim: The purpose of this study is to address potential factors which may impact the incorporation of PDAs to medical education, including data security and information privacy, interoperability, scalability and network connectivity, education and training, familiarity of using PDAs (technology comfort), electromagnetic interference, social acceptance, maintenance and support and other relevant aspects. Now, the evidence in the literature is much less definite as to whether such factors may affect the incorporation of PDAs to medical education. Methods: The qualitative in-depth interviews were used to explore the attitudes of participants regarding the incorporation of PDAs into medical curriculum. The semi-structured interview questions were formulated based on the two-phase literature reviews and scoping study. Results: Two major aspects for the incorporation of PDAs into the PBL-medical curriculum at the UOW were determined from the interviews, these being technical and practical aspects. Considerable factors in IT aspect are data security and information privacy, data transmission and network connectivity, maintenance and support and interoperability among different PDA platforms. The practical aspects comprise three major components, which may influence the incorporation of PDAs into medical- - curriculum, these being, education and training, electromagnetic interference and social acceptance, respectively. Conclusion: Factors to be considered before incorporating PDAs into medical education have been identified. What has yet to be determined is the strategy for incorporating of these devices into PBL-context, what necessary information for students should be carried on their PDAs, what information would be suitable for students in evidence-based medicine, how to ensure that incorporation of PDAs provides students and medical faculty effective learning given the attendant financial and resource implications.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1672-0; POD:978-1-4577-1673-7","10.1109/ITHET.2011.6018686","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6018686","IT adoption;e-learning;feasibility;handheld computers;mobile learning;personal digital assistants","Data privacy;Data security;Educational institutions;Interviews;Maintenance engineering;Personal digital assistants","computer aided instruction;data privacy;health care;medical computing;notebook computers;open systems;social aspects of automation","PBL-medical curriculum;PDAs;clinical decision making;data security aspect;electromagnetic interference aspect;evidence-based medicine;information privacy aspect;interoperability aspect;maintenance aspect;medical curriculum;medical education;network connectivity aspect;patient documentation;patient tracking;personal digital assistants;scalability aspect;social acceptance aspect;technology comfort aspect","","0","","9","","","","4-6 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Over the past few years, we have been piloting and refining a learning design support strategy, entitled HEART: HEaring And Realizing Teaching-voice. HEART aims to enhance educators' learning design awareness and capability by eliciting and depicting the pedagogical beliefs underpinning a course or learning design. HEART has shown its potential to promote discussion and reflection of the beliefs and values that underpin course design. These beliefs can otherwise act as invisible but powerful obstacles to achieving the cross-cultural understandings necessary for effective e-learning design and implementation.

This paper reports a study into the business and IT alignment maturity of the Dutch Vocational Education and Training sector. A survey study was undertaken to assess the alignment maturity levels in these organizations, as a baseline for further development. In the study, the following questions were put forward: - Is alignment in the educational sector really as low and problematic as can be concluded from earlier studies? - If alignment in the education sector is low, is it because of lack of ambition or because of lack of ability? - Do different education organizations have different levels of alignment? The study shed some light on the answers to these questions and provided a practical development path for the participation organizations.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5392-4; POD:978-1-4244-5391-7","10.1109/CISE.2010.5677247","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677247","","Educational institutions;Government;Industries;Training","commerce;educational institutions;information technology","Dutch Vocational Education and Training sector;IT;business processes;education organizations;educational institutions;educational organizations;information technology","","1","","19","","","","10-12 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The World Health Organization names this as a global epidemic identifying it as a big challenge to Information and Communication Technologies that can provide valuable tools to improve population health and well-being. In tandem with a strategy to provide information and education to individuals at risk, several projects across the world at national or regional levels are trying to address this challenge. The HEARTRONIC project developed an innovative system for prevention and early warning by continuous monitoring the heart conditions. This system is wearable by the patient, monitors and analyzes the ECG, and in the event of results that could predict a heart attack or stroke an alert message is sent to a server and then relayed to the responsible healthcare professional. The system uses ECG processing for automatic detection of abnormal functioning. First response actions are taken but the healthcare professionals are always in the control. The BIOMED-TEL project developed an innovative remote patient monitor that supervises 24 hours/7 days the main patient's vital signals in its environment. These signs are: SpO<inf>2</inf>, ECG one derivation, arterial blood pressure (BP), in conjunction with the body vibration acquired from chest zone and, glucose concentration in blood all above mentioned signs being relevant for the health patient status. With the correlation of the signals, the remote monitor is able to dynamical adapt his working regime from local storage of data acquired (as a classical holter) to continuously transmission of data acquired from patient to the hospital server, providing a quick time intervention of the health care professional in case of patient's alarm or emergency situation. Both projects are gathering efforts by comparing methods in order to assess the best practices and address the technical challenges that came across the development of such useful- - platforms.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6725-9; POD:978-1-4244-6724-2","10.1109/AQTR.2010.5520712","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5520712","","Biomedical monitoring;Cardiac disease;Cardiovascular diseases;Communications technology;Condition monitoring;Electrocardiography;Heart;Medical services;Patient monitoring;Wearable computers","","","","1","","20","","","","28-30 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A great challenge is presented to Superior Education Institutions: to establish the link between traditional cycles: technical, technology and professional ones with the secondary, basic and media levels. Our solution is presented linking each phase with a propedaeutic component discussed in a model. The model is dialogically integrated by cognitive an informational components. A structural system to determine and analyze the cohesion and coherence of the propedaeutic cycles between competences and the curriculum knowledge. This construct enables curricular knowledge management inside the media and higher education. Several types of matrices are developed; firstly regarding columns: the longitudinal one in time (semesters); secondly the cross one grouped by curriculum subjects, (additionally each cell of them can be expressed by fuzzy values); thirdly regarding the structure: the input/output for optimization purposes. An individualized model of student productivity to be integrated to counteract the stereotypes which considers the technical and technological cycles as relegated careers in higher education. This model is an intelligent knowledge based one which was validated with a software prototype just implemented in the FESSJ. This construct has as its mission the guarantee of quality assurance of student's propaedeutic cycles. A multidimensional flexibility system supported on university autonomy for managing student, pedagogical, and curricular knowledge which enables the management of the heterogeneous and complex environment; this subsystem is intended to ensure continuity and permanence of the student. The earlier is framed within a construct of curriculum knowledge and information. From this it is intended to reduce the high complexity of the harmonization and articulation of the propaedeutic cycles which face the - niversities when undertaking these projects.

In this paper, the researcher integrated theories of knowledge-based view, a resource-based view of the firm and a strategy to develop a suitable framework and model for information technology research; and empirically tested the research model within the Tallon's information technology investment dimension. In particular, the influence of knowledge management issues among academic leaders which have been neglected in Malaysian previous studies were examined. Data from the survey were examined using multiple regression analysis. Results indicate that strategy and information technology investment explain 38% of variance in predicting the effort of IHLs to develop appropriate knowledge management system. An important management implication of this paper is that it confirms that the greater usage of both strategy and information technology investment and knowledge management system in higher education would enhance the operational and strategic direction of IHLs. This paper further suggests that a greater utilization of specific information technology investment in crafting the corporate strategy both in the aspect of operational effectiveness (interna- ly) and strategic positioning (externally) would help leaders of IHLs to pinpoint areas within the universities where knowledge management issues are creating value.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6349-7; POD:978-1-4244-6347-3","10.1109/ICCET.2010.5485728","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5485728","Malaysia;corporate strategy;higher education;information technology investment;knowledge management","Appropriate technology;Educational institutions;Educational technology;Information management;Information technology;Investments;Knowledge management;Regression analysis;Technology management;Testing","further education;information technology;knowledge management;regression analysis;social aspects of automation","Malaysia;Tallon information technology investment dimension;corporate strategies;higher education;higher learning institutions;knowledge management system;multiple regression analysis;private institutions","","1","","19","","","","16-18 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

E-government is an important part of this strategy, however there appears to be a lack of understanding of the social factors that may influence citizens' intention to use e-government. This paper makes a contribution in examining these factors through a literature search and questionnaire and data collected from 400 Jordanian participants. The research explores four different social factors: trust in terms of the security and privacy and trust in government, attitudes and beliefs, education, and accessibility. This research uses exploratory factor analysis to identify the main factors that may influence e-government adoption in Jordan.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5648-2; POD:978-1-4244-5647-5","10.1109/ICITST.2009.5402528","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5402528","","Business;Communications technology;Electronic government;Humans;Privacy;Security;Social factors;Technological innovation;Web and internet services;Web pages","government data processing;social aspects of automation","Jordan;e-government adoption;information communication technology","","2","","37","","","","9-12 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This can be done by introducing or using Information Technology & related tools in school education or by using World Wide Web as education delivery medium. The WWW is used not only to disseminate information but it also provides a great prospect to extend learning outside space and time boundaries. The remarkable developments in IT and networking have opened the doors of education for people who are willing but do not have the benefit of a conducive environment. In the era of IT, e-learning can be efficiently used for different types of education. Most of the population of India is in the rural areas where literacy rate is poor due to the lack of educational facilities. But implantation of an e-learning system has some problems. The problems can be solved but needs proper planning and strategies. This paper focuses on the problems for implementing the system in rural area, suggests some strategies to solve these problems. While implementing any system, the understanding of different components and their functions is necessary. in e-learning system there are different components like technology, content, services, e-learner etc. This paper discusses the key issues related with these components and their functions within the system such as services to be provided, content design criteria.

The aspiration is to put the Malaysian education on the global map by transforming the tertiary education into a center of academic excellence. Timeframe: 2010. It's vision: regional center for higher education learning that focuses on finance and banking, biotechnology, information and communication technology (ICT) multimedia content development, advanced manufacturing and industrial design. End result: human capital with first class mentality. First introduced by Mahathir Mohamad in 1991, Vision 2020 is developed further by Abdullah Ahmad Badawi with the notion of Malaysian Nobel Laureates and Malaysia as the education hub for international scholars by 2057. With that in mind, the National Higher Education Action Plan (NHEAP) was launched in 2007 with five critical agendas accompanied by five pillars to strengthen all Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). Prior to that, four research universities (RU) were established in 2006 in a move to highlight the importance of research in Malaysian Academia. An APEX (Accelerated Programme for Excellence) University was further created in 2008, hoped to be Malaysian's first world class university. With this Malaysia hopes to bump its universities up to the Top 100 in THE-QS world university ranking (THE-QS) by 2010. Due to rapid changes in the Malaysian education landscape, not to mention the high expectation posed on the academia, issues and complications may arise as Malaysia is venturing forward into shifting th- mindset of not only Malaysians but also the world that Malaysia too has an equal footing in the global education arena. The challenges faced should be anticipated prior to APEX implementation and strategies should be put in place in line with problem identification. The impact this education revolution should be carefully weighed and studied especially the foreseeable gap of education quality and funding allocation in APEX, research and other local HEIs. - he success of this new aspiration requires commitment, effort, collaboration and cooperation from all, not only HEIs and the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) but also encompassing the government and corporate sectors.","","POD:978-0-7695-3892-1","10.1109/ICCTD.2009.175","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5360202","APEX University;Malaysia;higher education;world class mentality;world class university","Banking;Biotechnology;Communication industry;Communications technology;Educational programs;Finance;Forward contracts;Manufacturing;Multimedia communication;Roads","educational institutions","APEX University;Malaysian academia;Malaysian education landscape;academic excellence;education hub;education learning;education quality;education revolution;first class mentality;global education arena;higher education institutions;human capital;international scholars;tertiary education;world class university","","1","","15","","","","13-15 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Using technologies to change the ‘learning landscape’ in healthcare practice: The case of the NHS in England","P. Candy","University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Australia","2009 IEEE International Symposium on IT in Medicine & Education","20090915","2009","1","","11","11","The National Health Service (NHS) in England is the largest organisation in Europe, with over 1.3 million people working in it, and serving the needs of some 50 million citizens. The NHS is halfway through a ten year plan to implement the National Program for IT, the largest civilian IT project in the world. It is intended to bring the benefits of advanced information technologies for the maintenance of integrated care records to every public healthcare facility in England. Clearly there is a need for a great deal of education and training for such a large deployment, and a national strategy has been developed to use the same technology to deliver large-scale e-learning to hundreds of thousands of end-users, thus realising what has been dubbed a 'double dividend' from the national program. Indeed, the benefits of using the technology to support learning do not end with learning about the national program, because once the infrastructure is in place, it can be used for other information and learning purposes as well. Thus, technology which is originally being deployed for clinical and management purposes, is also at the same time subtly changing the 'learning landscape' for the people who work in, with and for the NHS. This presentation will explore several major aspects of how technology is being used to deliver work-based e-learning, to provide electronic performance support, to allow access to information resources and communities of practice, and even to allow for the collection and sharing of data in real-time for both diagnostic and research purposes. The presentation will consider the challenges of working with a large and geographically distributed workforce, with very different levels of technological skill and confidence, and how learning at work can connect, on the one hand, with formal learning in universities and colleges and, on the other hand, with informal and self-directed learning in the home or community. The presentation will also consider how- digital technologies not only have the ability to supplement face-to-face learning in a range of blended approaches but, because of their immense storage capacities, can in fact expand or amplify the human capacity for learning.","","POD:978-1-4244-3928-7","10.1109/ITIME.2009.5236470","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5236470","","Educational institutions;Educational programs;Educational technology;Electronic learning;Europe;Information technology;Large-scale systems;Medical services;Public healthcare;Technology management","health care;medical information systems","National Health Service;face-to-face learning;information resources;integrated care records maintenance;large-scale e-learning;national strategy;public healthcare facility","","0","","","","","","14-16 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The present article explores how such technologies are integrated into the classroom environment and also their influences, especially on post-secondary faculty development. This paper makes a case for the full implementation of ICT in university programs for the education of professionals, typically architects and civil engineers -- those who are learning to design in the marketplace of the future. The evidence that the potential influence of these technologies is more positive than negative is overwhelming if instructional strategies and techniques are adapted to the new technologies rather than the new technologies merely being grafted onto old methods. Discussion of the cultural and theoretical dimensions of using ICTs for professional education with a brief consideration of the effects of ICTs on faculty collegiality will be explored. The author concludes that whatever their limitations and difficulties, ICTs should be implemented integrally and extensively in the future education of design professionals.","","POD:978-0-7695-3653-8","10.1109/IACSIT-SC.2009.68","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5169323","Architecture;Design;Education;Educational Change;ICTs","Communications technology;Computer architecture;Computer science education;Continuing education;Cultural differences;Design engineering;Educational programs;Educational technology;Human computer interaction;Springs","architecture;civil engineering computing;computer aided instruction;continuing professional development;design engineering","architects;civil engineers;communication technologies;design professionals education;information technologies;instructional strategies;post-secondary faculty development;university programs","","0","","23","","","","17-20 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The challenge posed to the different actors involved also accelerates the changes that have been happening in education and training, empowering a society based on knowledge. Thus, it has been developed a new platform, Learning Roadmap Studio, which powers eLearning 2.0 concepts, that tends to promote more efficient learning and training. For teachers and course managers, it enables the creation, edition and deployment of learning roadmaps, that can be edit by students in order to communicate and share their knowledge among the learning community. For the students, the learning roadmap aims at promoting self-study and supervised study, endowing the pupil with the capabilities to find the relevant information and to capture the concepts in the study materials. The outcome will be a stimulating learning process together with an organized management of those materials. It is not intended to create new learning management systems.

The education world is experiencing a change not just in terms of curriculum but also in terms of approaches to teaching and learning strategies. These changes in learning strategies from traditional to dynamic strategies based on the use of information technology create a learner centered learning environment. The most important role of an instructor in an online environment is a high degree of interactivity and participation. This means designing and conducting learning activities that result in engagement with the subject matter and with fellow learners using proper pedagogical approaches are very important.The development of e-Learning in the sciences in general and in mathematics in particular has not met the general expectations. The instructional design of the teaching of mathematics incorporates the elements on mathematical approaches, hierarchy of teaching, interactive multimedia, systematically designed and developed teaching and learning modules and sub modules, and holistic development of students OO (Object-Oriented) analysis and design techniques were developed to help in the modeling of business, the analysis of requirements and the design software. With the rapid growth of OO technology, a number of techniques in OO have been developed and integrated. UML was designed to bring together the best feature of a number of analysis and design techniques and notations to produce an industry standard.The unified modeling language (UML) is an effective and popular notation which is used to capture high-level designs for software systems. However, one aspect of software system design which is not typically captured in a UML document is a record of the likely (or desired) rate of performance of the major activities of the system. When this information is not included in the initi- - al UML description of a system it increases the likelihood that the performance of the software system being developed will not be considered until very late in the software development process.","2154-7491;21547491","POD:978-0-7695-3489-3","10.1109/ICACTE.2008.15","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4737126","","Education;Educational technology;Fellows;Information technology;Internet;Learning systems;Mathematics;Software design;Software systems;Unified modeling language","Internet;Unified Modeling Language;computer aided instruction;distance learning;mathematics computing;multimedia computing;natural sciences computing;object-oriented methods;software engineering;teaching","Internet technology;UML description;Unified Modeling Language;Web-based learning system;interactive multimedia;learner centered learning environment;mathematical instruction;mathematics teaching;object-oriented approach;pedagogical approach;software development process;software system","","0","","25","","","","20-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The World Health Organization identifies these diseases as challenges to population health and well being and calls it a global epidemic. These diseases can seriously affect the life of both the patient and family. In tandem with a strategy to provide information and education to individuals at risk, Information and Communication Technologies can be a valuable tool to address the challenges posed by this global epidemic. The HEARTRONIC project is developing an innovative system for prevention and early warning by continuous monitoring the heart conditions. This system is wearable by the patient, monitors and analyzes the heart beat, and in the event of results that could predict a heart attack or stroke an alert message is sent to a server and them relayed to the responsible healthcare professional. The system uses EGC processing for automatic detection of abnormal functioning. First response actions are taken but the healthcare professionals are always in the control loop and can cancel or impose actions other than the ones decided by the system. System integration is starting and first trials are planned. Besides validating systems functionalities, these trials will allow to calibrate the sensitivity of the algorithms: high sensitivity may cause numerous false positives, while low sensitivity may result in misdiagnosis of potentially life threatening conditions.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2577-8; POD:978-1-4244-2576-1","10.1109/AQTR.2008.4588878","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4588878","","Biomedical monitoring;Cardiac arrest;Cardiac disease;Cardiovascular diseases;Communications technology;Condition monitoring;Heart beat;Medical services;Patient monitoring;Wearable computers","diseases;electrocardiography;health care;medical signal detection;patient care;patient diagnosis;patient monitoring;wearable computers","EGC processing;HEARTRONIC project;World Health Organization;automatic detection;cardiovascular diseases;continuous monitoring;control loop;coronary diseases;global epidemic;healthcare professional;heart attack;heart beat;heart conditions;information and communication technology;patient monitoring;population health;system integration;wearable computing","","4","","10","","","","22-25 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the major difficulties is owing to the lack of a learning environment that can record the learning portfolio of using information technologies in education, such that the teacher can analyze and evaluate the learning performance of students, and hence the teaching strategies can be adjusted accordingly. In this paper, we propose a Web-search learning environment based on meta-index approach, which is able to assist the teachers in analyzing student learning behaviors of using search engines for problem solving. An experiment on 161 K4 students has been conducted to evaluate the benefits of this approach. Experimental results showed that the novel approach is able to assist the teachers to acquire more about the learning status of students, and hence more constructive suggestions can be given accordingly.","","POD:0-7695-2882-1","10.1109/ICICIC.2007.384","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4427800","","Education;Educational technology;Information analysis;Information technology;Internet;Performance analysis;Portfolios;Problem-solving;Search engines;Web pages","Internet;computer aided instruction;educational administrative data processing;search engines;teaching","Web-search learning environment;computer technologies;education;information technologies;learning portfolio;meta-analyzer;meta-index approach;network technologies;problem solving;search engines;student information searching behavior analysis;teaching strategies","","2","","14","","","","5-7 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of Gestalt principles in technology and engineering education aims to facilitate meaningful learning in a global environment through the application of holism, relating learning to the environment, development of mental models, and team learning. The paper presents a brief overview of Gestalt theory and shows how Gestalt principles (proximity, closure, symmetry, figure-ground segregation, good continuation, and similarity) can be applied to improve a learner's comprehension of PLM concepts. Adding Gestalt principles complemented the information-organization feature of more commonly used knowledge maps and thereby enhancing factual recall, concept development, and application.

A paradigm shift has emerged which ranges from single silicon devices to a multitude of materials and integrated systems. The research approach has evolved accordingly: from mono-disciplines to multi-disciplinary research involving physics, mathematics, chemistry, medicine, biotechnology, mechanics, and micro-nano electronics. The development and integration of heterogeneous technologies at the interface of nanotechnology, biotechnology and information & communication technologies towards miniaturised, multifunctional and cost-effective systems is being attracting great interest and effort, world wide. In particular, under the research and technology development framework programme (FP) 6 of the European Union [2002-2006], the Information Society Technologies program (1ST), micro-nano systems sector2, invested more than 100 meuro through academic and industrial cooperative projects, striving a balance between technological innovation (discovery) and integration into functional systems that can be plugged into real-life environment (applied R&D). The group of EC-funded projects on Micro-Nano-Bio Convergence Systems, ""so-called"" MNBS, is made by projects developing systems that use a vast array of technologies to integrate across traditional boundaries between the micro-nano- bio, and info worlds, enabling a wide range of applications from health care to food quality monitoring. The group could be divided, at its current stage, in two main categories: - Biosensors, DNA & protein arrays, biochips, lab on chip, and other miniaturised systems enabling point of care, in vitro molecular diagnosis, and biological analysis. Such projects develop and integrate components and modules e.g. microfluidics, biosamples preparation, sensing, detection, signal processing and data reading/handling. Applications in biomedicine and healthcare include e.g. early cancer - - diagnostics, prognosis and disease recurrence (e.g. breast, prostate, lung and colorectal), malaria detection, diabetes monitoring and deep vein thrombosis early detection. Another promising research line is on wearable biochemical sensing though sweat analysis, targeting applications such as sports and human performance, obesity and wound healing. - Body sensors, implantable systems, endoscopic probes, active electrodes and other miniaturised systems interacting with the human body to enable several applications e.g. drug delivery, repairing of vital functions and diagnosis. These projects develop and integrate components and systems e.g. sensors, actuators, micro/nano electrodes, power supply, signal & data processing, and wireless telecommunication modules to fulfil predefined applications requirements. Such examples are smart implant sensors and systems e.g. glaucoma & retina sensor, intra-cranial pressure sensor, cochlear implant, functional electrical stimulation for limp motion, activity monitor, sphincter sensor and biosensor for blood glucose monitoring. Other examples include endoscopic probes (for gastrointestinal tumor recognition and therapy), active neural electrode system for stimulation and recording of brain activity and disorders; drug delivery through intraoral microsystem; non invasive Sensors and systems for attention, stress, vigilance and sleep on the go. The cluster aims at, promoting excellence and relevance within the community, building critical mass of activities with clear visibility and societal impact, as well as identifying possible synergies and common interest topics for further collaboration e.g. packaging, manufacturing, common infrastructure, standardization, ethics, testing-validation, market analysis & roadmapping, as well as dissemination, awareness and education.

In the current era of information technology, the Internet and other electronic media are extensively used for its potential to improve educational experiences for all the stakeholders: students, researchers and teachers. As people are free to find and use wealth of information, in many of the cases, they are tempted to adopt plagiarism through copy-and-paste instead of assistance. Over decades, a variety of methods of plagiarism detection and prevention have been proposed such as a) plagiarism detection using electronic tools [1], [2], [3], b) improving learning and teaching ethics by conducting specialized courses, c) penalizing persons responsible for their guilt, d) creating awareness about copyright act and cyber law, etc. None of them alone could eliminate the temptation of practicing plagiarism by the students, researchers and surprisingly even by the teachers. Thus comprehensive plans and strategies are necessary to combat plagiarism for effective rendering of education. In this paper, we identified some impacts of plagiarism on learning, teaching and research. In doing so, we interviewed (both open and close ended) students, teachers and researchers from six universities in Bangladesh [4]. The sampled data is analyzed to identify most widely practiced means [5], [6] of plagiarism by three target groups (i.e. students, researchers and teachers) and how they are being currently dealt with by the authority. Finally, strategies are suggested for combating plagiarism, which are a) inclusion of some articles on plagiarism in the existing copyright act and cyber law, or creating a separate plagiarism act, b) practice of code of ethics- - against plagiarism at HEIs through active work-groups to monitor and combat plagiarism, c) including plagiarism in the secondary and undergraduate syllabuses, research and development guidelines for conducting thesis and research papers and arranging seminars and lectures to stop plagiarism, etc.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0406-1; POD:1-4244-0405-3","10.1109/ITHET.2006.339791","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141654","Combating plagiarism;Educational ethics;Higher education;Plagiarism","Data analysis;Education;Educational institutions;Ethics;Guidelines;Information technology;Internet;Monitoring;Plagiarism;Research and development","Internet;educational computing","Internet;electronic media;higher education institution;plagiarism detection;research manuscripts;submitted assignments;teaching materials;unethical practices","","4","","11","","","","10-13 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We will argue that human beings are just about to move one step forward due to continued progress in information and communication technology (ICT). Current and upcoming developments are producing a huge amount of information and knowledge that should be ubiquitously available to everyone for various scenarios and arrangements. This fact has deep implications for all individuals themselves, but particularly also for design and implementation of technological models for virtual learning that should satisfy individual user differences by respecting user strategies, self-regulation and learning management. The consideration of the conceptual background involves new advanced aspects of presentation and interaction with information as well as their implementation for enhancing the Web-based learning performance. It reflects individualization facilities and points out the significance of complex interactivity, demonstrating how the concept can be used to improve learning design efforts in education. Dealing with this matter, this paper focuses on the bridging between a Web-enabled strategy for learning reflecting individualization aspects, and the related interface design along with the required level of security, safety and privacy. Good and reliable interface design allows the user to accomplish a variety of tasks, and to operate intuitively and individually. At the same time, it can gain the attention, and help to select and access the desired adequate information. By making use of it, this strategy helps increasing the users' awareness, confidence, and acceptance towards system and educational application - a prerequisite for nowadays e-learning success stories. This paper also describes the key concept, the recent implementation and the evaluation of the virtual learning environment in progress called ""Educational Media"" (EDMedia) and includes brief conclusions as well as directio- - ns for future work according to up-coming trends in educational and knowledge technology.

Reports by the Australian government indicate that adaptability and flexibility will be new skills sought after by employers. Therefore, graduates not only need to learn, but needed to learn how to learn efficiently and effectively so that they can adapt quickly. The authors suggest a combination of metacognition and the appropriate use of information technology in units adopting a studio learning model may be one solution for addressing this issue. The study examined the current use of metacognitive strategies in a studio based multimedia unit at Monash University and how these strategies could be adopted to increase learning effectiveness. The unit provides a flexible learning curriculum with students working in teams in conjunction with real clients on a range of projects which span the entire gamut of multimedia work. Every student's learning experience is unique due to the project they are involved with and the role they play in their team. The study investigates the metacognitive aspects of learning in the unit from the perspective of staff and students. This paper suggests how information technology can support the metacognitive aspects of learning. It will also outline results from a study conducted in 2005-06, which indicated that staff and students were not sufficiently aware of the benefits of metacognitive learning. It concludes by suggesting staff and students should be informed of the benefits of metacognitive learning and that adequate practices must be employed so that metacognitive skills can be developed","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0406-1; POD:1-4244-0405-3","10.1109/ITHET.2006.339801","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141664","Adaptability;lifelong learning;metacognition;technology","Australia;Education;Educational technology;Employment;Engineering profession;Government;Information technology;Problem-solving;Retirement;Seminars","computer aided instruction;continuing professional development;multimedia systems","flexible learning curriculum;higher education;information technology;lifelong learning skills;metacognitive learning;multimedia;studio learning model","","2","","45","","","","10-13 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, many organizations are unable to get the results they expect when they introduce knowledge management into their organizational business processes. This paper suggests a dynamic model of knowledge management for higher education development, based on the analysis of many case studies of knowledge management in knowledge intensive organizations and the Monash task-based KM approach. This has been successfully implemented in recent years. The purpose of this model is to increase knowledge efficiency and to enhance organizational knowledge learning and sharing for discovery and innovation of new knowledge, which differentiates an organization from its competitors. This model includes six knowledge management activities for capturing, storing, sharing, learning, exploring, and exploiting knowledge related to a particular task. Based on the proposed model, this paper also highlights three factors of implementing knowledge management strategies: people, policy, and technology. Each factor has a different impact on the success of KM strategies. This paper proposes that KM is more than just the advantage of technology, intranet and Internet, but includes organizational issues, assumes information resource management together with the cultural change which is important in the KM implementation process. Finally, this paper suggests eighteen essential steps for the process leading to the effective knowledge management in a technological and knowledge intensive age","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0406-1; POD:1-4244-0405-3","10.1109/ITHET.2006.339762","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141625","Competitive advantage;Higher education;Knowledge Management;Knowledge intensive organizations","Cultural differences;Educational products;Geography;Globalization;Hardware;Humans;Information technology;Internet;Knowledge management;Modems","educational computing;information management;knowledge management","higher education development;information resource management;knowledge discovery;knowledge intensive organization;knowledge management;organizational knowledge learning;organizational knowledge sharing","","4","","26","","","","10-13 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The speed of change and the scope of global communications have created alliances that alter organizational and institutional models as well as access to libraries, research, innovations. Universities, long immune to change by virtue of their role as societal institution, are challenged by technologies on all levels and are being reinvented with or without planned strategies. The extraordinary growth of means of communication, of access online to university courses, of new Internet-facilitated access to the vast resources of international libraries once held close to the smaller academic community, has exploded the concept of where knowledge resides and how it is to be accessed. New `brands' of learning follow on what may be called broadly, an e-commerce model driven by new technologies and the rapidity of communications. The trend to alliances between the university, business, and information distribution technologies is seen as crucial to the survival of both in global networks of private and national universities alike. Alliances in a global economy alter organizational and institutional models. The growth of such operations as Wikipedia, which is user-driven rather than faculty-driven, is an example outside the framework of university-based resources.

Technological advances in ocean observation, modeling, and data synthesis that have enabled the nation to enter a new era in oceanography, along with active NSF science programs underway in the Mid-Atlantic region, will be used to provide a source of data and information to scale up a variety of existing programs such as: professional development opportunities for middle and high school teachers (grades 5-9) that will lead to the creation of new Earth sciences and other science teaching modules within the classroom; pre-service training programs that feature hands-on exposure to geoscience research, important teaching resources including audiovisual materials, and the internet technologies that can link active research programs to their future students; and; graduate training for students enrolled in geoscience graduate programs by offering fellowship support that combines knowledge creation with knowledge translation and transfer to K-12 teachers. Each of these programs will be delivered in relevant formats including face to face programs, internships, and emerging technologies such as video streaming and distance learning and the worldwide web.

In response to these growing pressures, there has been a call for HEIs to improve operational efficiency and to reduce duplication of resources by implementing advanced information systems that span the institution and improve processes. In response, HEIs have turned their efforts to implementing complex enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. These systems are seen as the solution to address the growing governmental information requirements and to improve competitiveness, but do these systems represent a viable proposition for the diverse higher education sector with its traditionally strong and fragmented structure and culture? This paper investigates whether ERP systems offer a feasible information systems strategy for HEIs, using a 'critical success factor' model. Four in-depth case studies were conducted in HEIs that were in the process of implementing ERP systems. Numerous complexities, especially cultural and political ones, arose in light of the traditional structure of HEIs. The findings suggest that a careful use of communication and change management procedures to handle the business process reengineering (BPR) impact of ERP systems can alleviate some of the problems, but a more fundamental issue concerning the cost feasibility of system integration, training and user licenses may, in the end, impede ERP system utilization.","","POD:0-7695-1435-9","10.1109/HICSS.2002.994295","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994295","","Business communication;Business process re-engineering;Continuing education;Cultural differences;Enterprise resource planning;Global communication;Government;Information systems;Information technology;Management training","business data processing;educational administrative data processing;management information systems;planning;politics;socio-economic effects","advanced information systems strategy;business process reengineering;case studies;change management procedures;communication procedures;competition;competitiveness;contextual factors;cost feasibility;critical success factors;culture;enterprise resource planning;fragmented structure;government funding;governmental information requirements;higher education institutions;information technologies;operational efficiency;politics;public sector institutions;resource duplication;system integration;system utilization;training;user licenses","","11","","38","","","","7-10 Jan. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current strategies for providing clinical decision support and continuing medical education have failed in part, because they have not provided timely, easy access to information that is current, integrated with other information and the physician's workflow, and relevant to specific questions that occur during the patient encounters. Meeting these challenges involves understanding the nature of medical knowledge, the different information needs of physicians, the clinical decision making process, and the constraints of the physician's work environment, as well as the traditional barriers to physician education.

The theoretical foundations of our migration model come from technology management, organizational research (i.e. change management, and organizational roles), as well as existing approaches and models for this kind of migration.

Distance education is desirable for those who are unable to attend the traditional class, because of their work requirements. A distant education system can be very effective and useful to provide a learning environment in which teacher and students located remotely can participate in the same lecture and exchange their ideas and opinions. Also it can overcome the other deficiencies of the educational system which does not provide an environment to make up for missed lectures. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated environment for the delivery of course material, independent of time and geography. The paper covers the motivation for virtual classrooms, the selection and the use of delivery technologies, strategies and issues, and participant feedback. The components of this Web based classroom environment are Active Server Pages (ASP), the Server database, Java and VB scripts, and an Internet Information Server (IIS) application. ASP provides a means for Web developers to activate their Web sites with dynamic live database-driven content. The code that produces this rich content runs on the server. Integrating such emerging technologies would truthfully produce an effective distance learning environment","","POD:0-7803-6312-4","10.1109/SECON.2000.845624","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845624","","Application specific processors;Computer aided instruction;Databases;Distance learning;Feedback;Geography;Internet;Java;Paper technology;Web server","Java;distance learning;educational computing;file servers;information resources","Active Server Pages;Internet Information Server;Java;Server database;VB scripts;Web based classroom environment;Web developers;Web sites;course material;delivery technologies;distance learning environment development;distant education system;dynamic live database-driven content;information age;integrated environment;learning environment;missed lectures;participant feedback;remote locations;students;teacher;technological infrastructure;virtual classrooms;work requirements","","1","","4","","","","2000","07 Apr 2000-09 Apr 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A formal EMC educational course basically includes a broad comprehensive introduction to electromagnetic interference (EMI) problems and their hardening and analysis techniques, computational electromagnetics, methods of EMI measurement and various standards and specifications used in the international levels, as well as instrumentation and case histories of the EMC problems. This is also aimed at training the working engineers in industries, as engineers are keenly interested in EMC because of the competitive nature of today's market. The educational course is designed by the expert teaching staff to provide proper motivation and realism and practical aspects of the EMI situations. The course is divided into two parts. To begin with, the education course may consist of a lecture segment covering the essential topics like EMC aspects, EMC requirements for electronic systems, signal spectra, crosstalk, shielding, electromagnetics etc., and is followed by practical design of various live electromagnetic problems experienced in information technology products and processes, measurements, seminars both by students and by experts from the industries, R&D houses and visits to EMC design centres in the second part. The paper addresses the syllabus of this integrated EMC course which is taught in undergraduate level of the Universities/Institutions. The paper emphasises the importance of nonformal EMC education to produce skilled manpower to look after the EMC design and measurement techniques in electronic industries.","","POD:81-900652-0-3","10.1109/ICEMIC.1999.871619","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=871619","","Computational electromagnetics;Electromagnetic analysis;Electromagnetic compatibility;Electromagnetic interference;Electromagnetic measurements;Electromagnetic shielding;Electronics industry;Industrial training;Measurement standards;Signal design","distance learning;educational courses;electrical engineering education;electromagnetic compatibility;electromagnetic interference;training","EMC aspects;EMC design;EMC design centres;EMC education;EMC educational course;EMC requirements;EMI;EMI measurement;India;computational electromagnetics;crosstalk;distance learning;electromagnetic interference;electromagnetics;electronic industries;electronic systems;information technology processes;information technology products;instrumentation;integrated EMC course;lecture segment;nonformal EMC education;shielding;signal spectra;specifications;standards;undergraduate level;working engineers training","","1","","7","","","","6-8 Dec. 1999","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The need to incorporate human-computer interaction (HCI) and especially `usability', into software design and system development is increasingly evident. If industry is to pay more attention to improving the usability of its software and systems, courses need to be established so that students gain knowledge and skills that are important in the real-world and experience realistic situations that address usability issues. To date, the provision of HCI education for practitioners has not been addressed substantively by most Australian universities. The paper describes the course that responds to industry needs.

This paper tests the applicability of Pavitt's model for the development of a contingency approach on the determinants of technological innovation. An empirical test in a sample of 105 Greek companies, showed that firms in different trajectories of Pavitt's taxonomy had differences in the rate of technological innovation. `Specialised suppliers' and `science-based' firms were found to have higher rates of innovation than `supplier dominated' and `scale intensive' ones. Most importantly, different variables proved to be significantly associated with innovation for each category of firms: innovation for `supplier dominated' firms was related with the market environment, acquisition of information, technology strategy, risk attitude and internal communication. For `scale intensive' firms the important determinants were related with the ability to raise funding and the education of personnel. For `specialised suppliers' innovation was associated with high growth rate and training and incentives offered to the employees to contribute towards innovation. Science-based firms depended upon technical and general qualifications of personnel, licensing and customer feedback.

Such environments consist of network applications and services. Good interactive response time is crucial to their success. Slow responses can quickly dissuade teachers and learners alike from investing their time in the use of these services. Responsiveness timings taken across 155 Mb/s IP/ATM networks have exposed traditional monolithic server performance as the main bottleneck in interactive response time. A strategy of providing bigger and faster monolithic server hardware in response to each occurrence of system slow down is not a good solution as it is expensive and inflexible. Cluster computing has proven a successful and cost effective alternative to conventional supercomputing and it would now seem to be appropriate to investigate its application to the problem of high performance network service provision. In order to research this issue a replicated resolute architecture has been designed to harness the combined power of multiple independent computers. The architecture is outlined and an initial implementation of its core component, a coherence server, is described.

This constitutes a significant basis for realizing time and cost cutting potentials while simultaneously engineering superior products and production processes. Suppliers are also increasingly being integrated both in product development and the setup, start-up and operation of production systems. Cross-company orders and projects are seldom managed transparently and efficiently in machinery and plant manufacturing in particular. This creates problems for companies with regard to delivery reliability . Moreover, approximately three quarters of the orders annually received by German machinery and plant manufacturers now come from abroad. This makes the integration of both regional and international partners in product development as well as in the setup and operation of new production systems essential. Transferring required knowledge between cooperation partners also translates into considerable time and work. New cooperation and communication strategies will have to organize this transfer so it is integrated throughout every phase of the product life cycle. Digital product and process models provide a fundamental basis. Digital tools such as 3-D CAD and simulation are already established in product development and integrating them with virtual reality (VR) technologies will furnish an opportunity in the future to advance the development of new forms of collaboration and information exchange between cooperation partners. The Fraunhofer IFF Virtual Development and Training Centre (VDTC) provides machinery and plant manufacturers VR based technology platforms on which methods and tools employing digital technologies can be developed, test- - ed and applied for 1)Virtual product development 2)Virtual process engineering and 3)Operation (education, operator training). These platforms are oriented toward the product life cycle from development to production and up through application. The approach is unique because it does not treat the stages as consecutive and independent. Instead, it applies the tools and methods being developed to integrate the use of virtual technologies throughout all phases and particularly to meet the needs of SME. This paper introduces the methodology behind the technical solution and presents experiences acquired during its implementation with a virtual development, testing and learning platform for a machinery manufacturer serving as an example.","1524-4547;15244547","POD:978-0-7695-3315-5","10.1109/WETICE.2008.61","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4806878","","Collaborative tools;Costs;Educational technology;Machinery;Manufacturing processes;Product development;Production systems;Project management;System testing;Virtual reality","education;process planning;product development;production engineering;virtual manufacturing","cost cutting;integrated unified process;learning platform;product development times;production processes;production startups;production system;superior product engineering;testing platform;virtual development","","0","","","","","","23-25 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, the design problem of pilot pattern is casted as a convex optimization. From the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions, the optimal analytical expression is derived when source and RS powers are given or fixed. Second, under the total transmit power sum constraint of source node and RS, an optimal power allocation (OPA) strategy is proposed to further alleviate the effect of Sum-MSE.

In the second proposed method (DJ protocol), a source transmits its secrecy signal at the same time a destination transmits its jamming signal.

In Scenario I, we propose an alternating optimization scheme that maximizes the secrecy EE of the Alice tier by controlling the node-activation probability, the confidential message rate, the redundancy rate, and the number of active antennas. Simulation result shows that the proposed scheme can achieve the optimal secrecy EE. In Scenario II, we study an energy-efficient node activation game between the Alice tier and the Eve tier, where the former and the latter control their node-activation probabilities to maximize the secrecy EE and the eavesdropping EE, respectively. We show that the node activation game admits a unique Nash equilibrium. The node-activation probabilities of the Alice tier and the Eve tier at the Nash equilibrium can be used to estimate their network lifetimes, which are important information for the energy-efficient secure network design.

However, these storage systems usually adopt the same replication and storage strategy to guarantee data availability, i.e., creating the same number of replicas for all data sets and randomly storing them across data nodes. Such strategies do not fully consider the difference requirements of data availability on different data sets. More servers than necessary should thus be used to store replicas of rarely-used data, which will lead to increased energy consumption. To address this issue, we propose an energy-efficient storage strategy for cloud datacenters based on a novel hypergraph coverage model. According to users’ requirements of data availability in different applications, our proposed algorithm can selectively determine the corresponding minimum hyperedge coverage, which represents the minimum set of data nodes required in the datacenter. Hence, some other data nodes can be turned off for the purpose of energy saving. We have also implemented our proposed algorithm as a dynamic runtime strategy in a HDFS based prototype datacenter for performance evaluation. Experimental results show that the variable hypergraph coverage based strategy can not only reduce energy consumption, but can also improve the network performance in the datacenter.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2017.2723004","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National program of international S&T cooperation; 10.13039/501100000923 - Australian Research Council; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100006606 - Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7968334","Energy saving;cloud datacenters;data availability;hypergraph;minimum <italic xmlns:ali=""http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/"" xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"">K</italic>-coverage","Algorithm design and analysis;Cloud computing;Distributed databases;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Energy storage;Heuristic algorithms","","","","","","","","Traditional","20170704","Dec. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, this is an inverse ill-posed problem. The most widely used way to resolve the problem is to introduce additional information as a regularization term and acquire the unique optimal solution. However, the regularization parameter either needs to be determined manually or it cannot be determined in a fully adaptive manner. Thus, in this paper, the multiobjective subpixel land-cover mapping (MOSM) framework for hyperspectral remote sensing imagery is proposed, in which the two function terms [the fidelity term and the prior term (i.e., the regularization term)] can be optimized simultaneously, and there is no need to determine the regularization parameter explicitly. In order to achieve this goal, two strategies are designed in MOSM: 1) a high-resolution distribution image-based individual encoding strategy is designed in order to calculate the prior term accurately and 2) a subfitness-based individual comparison strategy is designed in order to generate subpixel land-cover mapping solutions with a high quality to update the population. Four data sets (one simulated, two synthetic, and one real hyperspectral image) were used to test the proposed method. The experimental results show that MOSM can perform better than the other subpixel land-cover mapping methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of MOSM in balancing the fidelity term and prior term in the SPM model.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2017.2748701","Key Laboratory of Spatial Data Mining and Information Sharing of Ministry of Education Fuzhou University; National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province in China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8103932","Multiobjective optimization;remote sensing;subpixel mapping (SPM).","Graphical models;Hyperspectral imaging;Image resolution;Optimization methods","","","","","","","","","20171110","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The resubmission based strategy has an advantage in resource utilization, while the replication based strategy can reduce the task completed time in the context of fault. However, few researches take these two techniques together for fault-tolerant workflow scheduling, especially in Cloud systems. In this paper, we present a novel fault-tolerant workflow scheduling (ICFWS) algorithm for Cloud systems by combining the aforementioned two strategies together to play their respective advantages for fault tolerance while trying to meet the soft deadline of workflow. First, it divides the soft deadline of workflow into multiple sub-deadlines for all tasks. Then, it selects a reasonable fault-tolerant strategy and reserves suitable resource for each task by taking the imbalance sub-deadlines among tasks and on-demand resource provisioning of Cloud systems into consideration. Finally, an online scheduling and reservation adjustment scheme is designed to select a suitable resource for the task with resubmission strategy and adjust the sub-deadlines as well as fault-tolerant strategies of some unexecuted tasks during the task execution process, respectively. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on both real-world and randomly generated workflows.

Although there are multiple reasons for this, the problem often lies with integration of the project into the day-to-day institutional arrangements of the education system. This puts pressure on the school environment, since schools are unable to sustain the change introduced without support from their formal support systems. Although the ICT for Rural Education Development (ICT4RED) initiative was successful in integrating technology into rural schools, this success did not translate into the district and provincial levels of the educational system, since the challenges experienced in these systems were under-estimated. On completion of the initiative, a task was undertaken to retrospectively assess the factors that are critical to the integration of provincial ICT4E initiatives across provincial structures, and across different hierarchical levels of the education system. The key systemic levers for change, as well as critical issues for integration at each level, were identified.

The motor symptoms of PD can be attributed to the distorted relay reliability of thalamus to cortical sensorimotor input that results from the increase of inhibitory input from internal segment of the globus pallidum (GPi). Based on this, we construct the GPi-thalamocortical computational model to generate the normal and pathological firing patterns by varying GPi spike train input. A kind of closed-loop deep brain stimulation (DBS) strategy is proposed here. Our control objective is to make the controlled membrane potential of the thalamic neuron return to the normal firing pattern. The control input that directly acts on the thalamus is the DBS waveform, which is adjusted in real time according to the feedback signal. Aimed at a certain system without the change of object parameters or stochastic disturbance, the input–output feedback linearization method is able to eliminate the error between the system output and the desired output. When uncertain elements taken into consideration in the system, the simulation results indicate that sliding mode control scheme provides better effectiveness and higher robustness.","1534-4320;15344320","","10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2699223","Hong Kong Scholars Programs; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100006606 - Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin, China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7915778","Parkinsonian state;computational model;input–output feedback linearization;sliding mode control;uncertain disturbance","Computational modeling;Firing;Neurons;Relays;Reliability;Satellite broadcasting;Sliding mode control","","","","","","","","","20170502","Nov. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

There are numerous presences of GPS in new technologies, applications and consumer products especially in Smartphone's and tablets. In GPS receiver design, power consumption and localization accuracy act as critical factors that affect the GPS receiver system outcome. Theoretically, increasing the Number of Required Tracking Channels (NRTC) in the GPS baseband receiver will increase the design complexity and size. Hence, the power consumption would significantly increase. Furthermore, to improve the location accuracy of a position, more satellites should be acquired and tracked by the receiver. This requires higher number of tracking channels in the receiver. Thus, optimizing the number of tracking channels to balance the conflict among performance parameters is a difficult and challenging task. The objective of this study is to highlight the need for an effective strategy to balance the tradeoff between conflicted GPS design parameters. A conceptual framework is proposed for determining the optimum GPS baseband receiver tracking channels in terms of power consumption and localization accuracy. Nine different operation modes of GPS receiver are evaluated by each design parameters, namely, power consumption, localization accuracy, and time with no position available for static and dynamic positioning. Multi-criteria analysis is a good strategy to visualize the trade-off between GPS design parameters, and to provide a dynamic power consumption planning.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6465-6; POD:978-1-5090-6466-3; USB:978-1-5090-6464-9","10.1109/CoDIT.2017.8102743","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8102743","GPS receiver design;Multi-attributes decision making","Baseband;Global Positioning System;Power demand;Radio frequency;Receivers;Satellites","","","","","","","","","","5-7 April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many attempts to identify atherosclerosis plaques have focused on in vivo imaging techniques. An animal model with foregone plaque sites will be valuable to evaluate the validity of imaging method. Based on the “response-to-injury” hypothesis, lesions in the artery's endothelium might be the main mechanism. Therefore, we try to utilize focused ultrasound (FUS) cavitation to generate localized endothelial lesions instead of traditional balloon injury, and thereby induced localized, size-controlled plaques combined with high cholesterol diet. In this paper, rabbit abdominal aortas were processed by phase-shifted nanodroplets (PSND) enhanced FUS cavitation and balloon injury separately. Evans blue stained endothelial lesions were observed in both balloon and FUS cavitation injury. The injury regions caused by balloon were distributed on the whole vessel wall, while cavitation injuries were just located at US exposure sites. Additionally, the lesions with different sizes can be generated by adjusting US intensity, exposure time, etc. Furthermore, rabbits were developed plaques using high fat feeding, balloon injury plus fat feeding, and cavitation injury plus fat feeding separately. As a result of cavitation injury, the induced plaques were size-controlled and localized at the predictable site, while the plaque induced by balloon injury occurs randomly within the injury region. Therefore, cavitation injury might become an alternative and potential strategy to develop a localized and controllable atherosclerosis model.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3383-0; POD:978-1-5386-3384-7; USB:978-1-5386-3382-3","10.1109/ULTSYM.2017.8092766","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8092766","animal model;atherosclerosis;cavitation injury;endothelial damage;phase-changed nanodroplets","Arteries;Atherosclerosis;Fats;Injuries;Lesions;Rabbits;Ultrasonic imaging","","","","","","","","","","6-9 Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the back-to-back setup, various shaped quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) distributions are found to have the same implementation penalty as uniform input. By demonstrating in transmission experiments that shaped QAM input leads to lower effective SNR than uniform input at a fixed average launch power, we experimentally confirm that shaping enhances the fiber nonlinearities. However, shaping is ultimately found to increase the AIR, which is the most relevant figure of merit, as it is directly related to spectral efficiency. In a detailed study of these shaping gains for the nonlinear fiber channel, four strategies for optimizing QAM input distributions are evaluated and experimentally compared in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems. The first shaping scheme generates a Maxwell–Boltzmann (MB) distribution based on a linear additive white Gaussian noise channel. The second strategy uses the Blahut–Arimoto algorithm to optimize an unconstrained QAM distribution for a split-step Fourier method based channel model. In the third and fourth approach, MB-shaped QAM and unconstrained QAM are optimized via the enhanced Gaussian noise (EGN) model. Although the absolute shaping gains are found to be relatively small, the relative improvements by EGN-optimized unconstrained distributions over linear AWGN optimized MB distributions are up to 59%. This general behavior is observed in 9-channel and fully loaded WDM experiments.","0733-8724;07338724","","10.1109/JLT.2017.2752243","Alexander von Humboldt Professorship; FITweltweit program of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD); German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; 10.13039/501100001732 - DNRF; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8037974","Gaussian noise model;nonlinear fiber channel;probabilistic shaping;wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)","Channel models;Optimization;Probabilistic logic;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Signal to noise ratio;Two dimensional displays;Wavelength division multiplexing","","","","","","","","Traditional","20170914","Nov.15, 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this brief, we propose a novel class-specific representation strategy for object categorization. For each class, we first model the characters of images within the same class using Gaussian mixture model (GMM). We then represent each image by calculating the Euclidean distance and relative Euclidean distance between the image and the GMM model for each class. We concatenate the representations of each class for joint representation. In this way, we can represent an image by not only considering the visual contents but also combining the class-specific characters. Experiments on several public available data sets validate the superiority of the proposed class-specific representation method over well-established algorithms for object category predictions.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2757497","ARO; Faculty Research Gift Awards by NEC Laboratories of America and Blippar; National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Science Foundation of China; Scientific Research Key Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8082530","Class-specific representation;image classification;object categorization;visual representation.","Electronic mail;Euclidean distance;Image representation;Learning systems;Semantics;Training;Visualization","","","","","","","","","20171025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The properties of ENF enable forensic applications such as audio evidence timestamp verification and tampering detection. In this paper, based on a general review of existing works, we discuss several important practical problems and facts that have drawn less research attention or have not been formally studied, including ENF detection problems, limitations of the ENF-based tampering detection systems, and the difficulties in the ENF analysis. During ENF detection, the challenges come from not only the noise and the interference, but also the fact that audio recordings without captured ENF can still have signal components in the frequency band of interest (false positive). In ENF-based tampering detection systems, the weakness of commonly used assumptions and the limitations of several existing solutions are discussed. In addition, we reveal that in the most intensively studied ENF-based audio evidence timestamp verification, many works aiming at improving ENF estimation could only produce marginal performance improvement, while the main problems due to noise and interference remain open. All these analysis and discussions are related by a proposed big picture of ENF-based audio authentication systems. After that, we also investigate the strategies to design more reliable audio authentication systems based on the ENF, which consists of a series of research and investigation works.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2647921","Singapore Ministry of Education Research; 10.13039/501100001460 - Singapore Police Force, Ministry of Home Affairs, the Research; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7807225","Electric network frequency (ENF);audio authentication;audio forensics;audio tampering detection;audio timestamp verification","Audio recording;Authentication;Forensics;Interference;Reliability;Timestamp estimation;Verification","","","","","","","","OAPA","20170105","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

First, we formulate a general information theoretic setting that represents the database as a discrete memoryless source, and the users' requests as side information that is available everywhere except at the cache encoder. The decoders' objective is to recover a function of the source and the side information. By viewing cache aided networks in terms of a general distributed source coding problem and through information theoretic arguments, we present inner and outer bounds on the fundamental tradeoff of cache memory size and update rate. Then, we specialize our general inner and outer bounds to a specific model of content delivery networks: file selection networks, in which the database is a collection of independent equal-size files and each user requests one of the files independently. For file selection networks, we provide an outer bound and two inner bounds (for centralized and decentralized caching strategies). For the case when the user request information is uniformly distributed, we characterize the rate versus cache size tradeoff to within a multiplicative gap of 4. By further extending our arguments to the framework of Maddah-Ali and Niesen, we also establish a new outer bound and two new inner bounds in which it is shown to recover the centralized and decentralized strategies, previously established by Maddah-Ali and Niesen.

The proposed strategy consists mainly of an orientation algorithm and a localization algorithm. First, realizing that gyroscope is barely affected by magnetic field and magnetometer-based orientation has no cumulative error, a novel orientation algorithm, based on the self-tuning Kalman filter coupled with a gross error recognizer, is developed. This orientation algorithm can be applied to determine the robot heading angle in the situation with abundant ferromagnetic materials. Second, based on the orientation algorithm we have proposed, a novel localization algorithm is designed by decomposing the robot motion into uniform linear motion and uniform circular motion.

The purpose of this paper is to study how strong is the university-firm cooperation influence on firm value chains and how can this cooperation influence firm and university innovation and performance. The empirical analysis is based on data gathered through a questionnaire administered to a sample of Slovak SMEs operated in the area of ICT. The findings show that only contractual university-firm relationships have a direct and significant effect on innovation, whereas relational activities promote and support contractual activities. The findings have managerial implications not just for firms, but also for universities. University-firm relationships contribute to regional and global development, because they foster innovation processes regarding firms' strategies at those. In this liaison, universities' role usually is to promote knowledge-based economic development, which is basic for sustainable economic growt. The higher education institutions are facing an increasingly competitive environment with growing financial constraints, universities are strongly motivated to engage more actively with the firm, so as to establish new funding streams and secure additional research investment. This relationship should be beneficial for both firms and universities. Innovative firms are constantly searching for new ways to internalize external knowledge into their production function. With this aim, firms have found that the university-firm cooperation is a valuable mechanism to access to new technological resources, which can contribute to faster development of innovation, improved market access, economies of scale and scope, and cost sharing and risk spreading In this context, universities have been recognized as a capable research partner for solv- ng R&D problems and as advisers on technology strategies and by supporting the technology generation and/or the adoption of a new technology. Moreover, the cooperation with universities has been characterized by the timely appropriation of very-new technological opportunities and by the increment on the innovation sales, as well as the increase in the propensity to apply for patents. Several empirical studies have attempted to identify the factors determining the university-firm cooperation in innovation activities, concluding that this type of cooperation is based on the complementarity on the innovation processes, and on the uncertainty level of the innovation results. On the other hand, and based on a firm level analysis, some authors concluded that university-firm cooperation depends on the firm's absorptive capacity, on its innovative capacity, on its proximity to fundamental research, and in some firm-specific characteristics, like size and industrial affiliation.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3968-9; POD:978-1-5386-3969-6; USB:978-1-5386-3967-2","10.1109/ITHET.2017.8067819","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8067819","ICT firm;university-firm cooperation;value chain analysis","Economics;Education;Entrepreneurship;Europe;Informatics;Technological innovation","educational institutions;environmental economics;innovation management;investment;knowledge management;organisational aspects;small-to-medium enterprises;sustainable development","Slovak SME;contractual university-firm relationships;cooperation influence firm;economies of scale;firm level analysis;firm value chain;firm-specific characteristics;innovative firms;knowledge-based economic development;market access;research investment;sustainable economic growth;university innovation;university-firm cooperation influence;value chain analysis","","","","","","","","10-12 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) are adopting different strategies in their teaching curricula and assessment methods to encourage the development of team management skills among graduates, one of which is peer assessment. It is an important component in the design of an effective learning environment in Higher Education (HE) and for promoting a strong participatory and collaborative culture among students. It provides students with a platform to not only engage with the HE learning process but also to learn from each other by receiving and giving critical feedback. Reflective writing in HE offers a flexible platform for students to discuss the contributions made by peers in teamwork however, not many researchers have looked at its potential as a peer assessment tool. This study addresses this gap by using the case study of the MSc Engineering Management (EM) programme at York (UK). Using the method of content analysis, this study looks at the quality of peer assessment and the skills gap analysis demonstrated in the reflective assignments students undertake in one of the modules. The findings show the viability and potential of this method for building peer assessment skills. It eliminates some of the limitations like bias among students usually encountered in other peer assessment tools. It also helps in skills gap analysis and for understanding group dynamics in teamwork. Students should therefore, be encouraged to seek the application of such tools for skills analysis, to build up confidence in peer assessment and boosting employability factors.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3968-9; POD:978-1-5386-3969-6; USB:978-1-5386-3967-2","10.1109/ITHET.2017.8067802","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8067802","Employability;Higher Education;Peer Assessment;Reflective Writing;Teamwork","Education;Research and development management;Teamwork;Tools;Writing","educational computing;educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;further education;teaching;team working","MSc Engineering Management programme;employability factors;higher education students;peer assessment tool;teaching curricula;team management skills;team members","","","","","","","","10-12 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead, it is shown that the information needed for the control system to work at high level of effectiveness can be extracted from the input-output data by the use of the extended state observer (ESO). On the other hand, it is shown in this paper that the robustness of ADRC depends on the effectiveness of ESO. Furthermore, taking advantage of the rich body of knowledge in the existing field of robust control, the estimation error in ESO is analysed and, for the purpose of improved robustness, a unique nonlinear component is added to the conventional ADRC law. The modified ADRC which is a kind of robust ADRC law is validated in simulation for a nonlinear time-varying system with parametric and functional uncertainties. It is shown that the proposed robust ADRC law provides more effective tracking performance than the conventional ADRC when the bandwidth of ESO is not wide enough.","","CD:978-1-5090-5459-6; Electronic:978-1-5090-5461-9; POD:978-1-5090-5462-6","10.1109/DDCLS.2017.8068096","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8068096","Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC);Extended State Observer (ESO);Nonlinear Time-varying System;Robust Control","Control systems;Observers;Process control;Robust control;Robustness;Time-varying systems;Uncertainty","control system synthesis;nonlinear control systems;observers;robust control;time-varying systems","ESO;active disturbance rejection control;control system;controlled system;conventional ADRC law;data-driven control design strategy;detailed mathematical model;extended state observer;functional uncertainties;improved robustness;industrial control systems;input-output data;modified ADRC;nonlinear time-varying system;parametric uncertainties;robust ADRC law;robust control;unique nonlinear component","","","","","","","","26-27 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Pressures on the universities in the Slovak Republic are intensive and exhaustive. The technologies mainly digital technology change internal and external processes and provide opportunity for transformation. The paper deals with the fields of action of universities in quality assurance context. The university strategy includes the required level of outputs in relation with the inputs and processes. Today the universities define their strategy based on calculation their position on the market - the main source for comparison ranking agencies provide, on the internationalization implemented to the universities processes and on the calculation of university impact on the locality or region. The education quality assurance has become a necessary precondition of the accreditation process as well as for the position in rankings. Each university create its own procedure, using a different methodology. The University of Žilina, Slovakia chose a procedural approach. It was preceded by a detailed analysis of the situation and by the efforts to find examples of best practice at major global and European universities. This led to the creation of an internal system of education quality assurance at the university and to the creation of an original self-assessment tool. The tool would allow the assessment of the immediate level of maturity in the education quality assurance processes by the European Union and also the definition of the objectives of improvements for a next period.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3968-9; POD:978-1-5386-3969-6; USB:978-1-5386-3967-2","10.1109/ITHET.2017.8067795","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8067795","education quality;qualuty indicators;self-assessment tool;strategy;university","Education;ISO Standards;Monitoring;Quality assurance;Tools","computer aided instruction;educational institutions;quality assurance","European Union;European universities;Slovakia;University of Zilina;digital technology change;education quality assurance processes;global universities;quality assurance context;university impact;university strategy","","","","","","","","10-12 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Inferring Causal Direction From Multi-Dimensional Causal Networks for Assessing Harmful Factors in Security Analysis","G. Mai; Y. Hong; S. Peng; Y. Peng","School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China","IEEE Access","20171011","2017","5","","20009","20019","In many scenarios of security analysis, Bayesian methods are often used for assessing harmful factors like attacks, as Bayesian causal model can estimate or predict the effect from the observed factors. To distinguish which ones are direct or significant causal (harmful) factors to the target systems, we often need to calculate a (local) causal network, but the existing methods usually return Markov equivalence classes instead of an actual causal structure. In this paper, a new approach for inferring causal direction from multi-dimensional causal networks for assessing harmful factors in security analysis is proposed based on a split-and-merge strategy. The method first decomposes an n-dimensional network into induced subnetworks, each of which corresponds to a node in the network. We show that each induced subnetwork can be subsumed into one of the three substructures: one-degree, non-triangle, and triangle-existence substructures. Three effective algorithms are developed to infer causalities from the three substructures. The whole causal structure of the multi-dimensional network is obtained by learning these induced subnetworks separately. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is more general and effective than the state-of-the-art methods.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2746539","10.13039/501100001809 - NSFC-Guangdong Joint Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100007162 - Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province, China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8023750","Bayesian causal model;causal direction learning;security analysis;split-and-merge","Additive noise;Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Bayes methods;Boolean functions;Data structures;Security","","","","","","","","OAPA","20170831","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the last few years, devices, such as connected vehicles, smart phones, GPS navigation systems, and smart home appliances, have amassed the large stores of geographic data. The task of leveraging this data by employing moving objects database techniques to predict spatio-temporal locations in an accurate and efficient fashion, comprising a complete trajectory remains an actively researched area. Existing methods for frequent sequential pattern mining tend to be limited to predicting short-term partial trajectories, at extremely high computational costs. In order to address these limitations, we designed a prefix-projection-based trajectory prediction algorithm called PrefixTP, which contains three essential phases. First, data collection, connected vehicles equipped with sensors comprise a vehicle grid and generate copious amounts of spatio-temporal data, in order to communicate and share traffic information. Second, model training, examining only the prefix subsequences, and projecting only their corresponding postfix subsequences into projected sets. Finally, trajectory matching, recursively finding postfix sequences meeting the requirement of minimum support count, and outputting the most frequent sequential pattern as the most probable trajectory. Fundamentally, PrefixTP supports three trajectory matching strategies which encompass all possibilities of prediction. Extensive experiments were conducted using real world GPS data sets, and the results show, when comparing predicted complete trajectories against partial short-term trajectories with a guarantee of real-time forecasting, that PrefixTP outperforms first-order, second-order Markov models, and Apriori-based trajectory prediction algorithm.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2017.2750075","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Planning Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education of China; Youth Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8063439","Trajectory prediction;connected vehicles;frequent sequential pattern;moving objects databases;prefix-projection.","Databases;Hidden Markov models;Pattern matching;Predictive models;Roads;Trajectory;Uncertainty","","","","","","","","","20171009","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Their inherent periodic magnetic fields are highly related to motor position. Correspondingly, the magnetic fields can be utilized to determine their own displacement and replace expensive sensors. However, the measurement result of this strategy seriously depends on magnetic field model (MFM) preciseness. To improve measurement accuracy, a novel MFM with Fourier series is proposed in this paper. First, a high-order theoretical model from theoretical derivation is developed. And the analyses show that even harmonics exist in the magnetic field of motor, which are not included in the theoretical model. This model deviation obviously affects measurement accuracy. Hence, the new MFM is reconstructed based on a high-order theoretical model. Comparative experiments with the three different MFMs are carried out to measure the displacement of the PMSLM. In the experiments, a linear hall sensors array containing eight sensors is self-developed to detect motor magnetic field. The root mean square of displacement measurement errors using a reconstruction model, a high-order theoretical model, and a fundamental model is 4.84, 8.42, and 758 μm, respectively. The experimental results validate that the measurement result of the proposed reconstruction MFM is better than the other two MFMs.","0018-9456;00189456","","10.1109/TIM.2017.2729379","10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002369 - Visiting Scholar Foundation of Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Technology & Systems, Ministry of Education, Chongqing University, Chongqing China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8010331","Magnetic field information;model reconstruction;permanent magnet (PM) synchronous motor;precision displacement measurement;successive solving algorithm (SSA)","Air gaps;Displacement measurement;Harmonic analysis;Magnetic sensors;Permanent magnet motors;Sensor arrays","Fourier series;displacement measurement;linear motors;machine control;magnetic fields;measurement errors;permanent magnet motors;synchronous motors","displacement measurement;displacement measurement errors;linear hall sensors array;magnetic fields;measurement accuracy;model reconstruction;permanent magnet synchronous motor;size 4.84 mum;size 758.0 mum;size 8.42 mum","","","","","","Traditional","20170814","Nov. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to achieve the secrecy rate maximum, we further study on the power allocation among the source, relays, and jammers under two assumptions of the wiretap link's channel state information. We derive the closed-form optimal solutions by first allocating the transmit power at the source within different ranges to consider all the possible relay selection schemes in which different numbers of relays are employed, and then transforming the multivariable power allocation problem to a set of single-variable optimization subproblems.

"DMOEA- $varepsilon text{C}$ : Decomposition-Based Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm With the $varepsilon $ -Constraint Framework","J. Chen; J. Li; B.

Its success has been witnessed by the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm MOEA/D and its variants. In decomposition-based methods, an MOP is decomposed into a number of scalar subproblems by using various scalarizing functions. Most decomposition schemes adopt the weighting method to construct scalarizing functions. In this paper, another classical generation method in the field of mathematical programming, that is the e-constraint method, is adopted for the multiobjective optimization. It selects one of the objectives as the main objective and converts other objectives into constraints. We incorporate the e-constraint method into the decomposition strategy and propose a new decomposition-based multiobjective evolutionary algorithm with the e-constraint framework (DMOEA-εC). It decomposes an MOP into a series of scalar constrained optimization subproblems by assigning each subproblem with an upper bound vector. These subproblems are optimized simultaneously by using information from neighboring subproblems.

The basic idea of these methods stems from the Group Lasso concept which deals with the variable selection problem at the group level. There are two main drawbacks when the Group Lasso penalty has been directly employed during network training. They are numerical oscillations and theoretical challenges in computing the gradients at the origin. To overcome these obstacles, smoothing functions have then been introduced by approximating the Group Lasso penalty. Numerical experiments for classification and regression problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithms perform better than the other three classical penalization methods, Weight Decay, Weight Elimination, and Approximate Smoother, on both generalization and pruning efficiency. In addition, detailed simulations based on a specific data set have been performed to compare with some other common pruning strategies, which verify the advantages of the proposed algorithm. The pruning abilities of the proposed strategy have been investigated in detail for a relatively large data set, MNIST, in terms of various smoothing approximation cases.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2748585","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8051266","Backpropagation;generalization;group lasso;penalty;smoothing approximation.","Approximation algorithms;Biological neural networks;Feedforward neural networks;Neurons;Smoothing methods;Training","","","","","","","","","20170926","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
"Aggregating Rich Hierarchical Features for Scene Classification in Remote Sensing Imagery","G. Wang; B. Fan; S. Xiang; C.

To obtain a high discriminative feature representation for an image to be classified, traditional methods usually consider to densely accumulate hand-crafted low-level descriptors (e.g., scale-invariant feature transform) by feature encoding techniques. However, the performance is largely limited by the hand-crafted descriptors as they are not capable of describing the rich semantic information contained in various remote sensing images. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel method to extract discriminative image features from the rich hierarchical information contained in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, the low-level and middle-level intermediate convolutional features are, respectively, encoded by vector of locally aggregated descriptors (VLAD) and then reduced by principal component analysis to obtain hierarchical global features; meanwhile, the fully connected features are average pooled and subsequently normalized to form new global features. The proposed encoded mixed-resolution representation (EMR) is the concatenation of all the above-mentioned global features. Due to the usage of encoding strategies (VLAD and average pooling), our method can deal with images of different sizes. In addition, to reduce the computational consumption in the training stage, we directly extract EMR from VGG-VD and ResNet pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. We show in this paper that CNNs pretrained on the natural image dataset are more easily applied to the remote sensing dataset when the local structure similarity between two datasets is higher. Experimental evaluations on the UC-Merced and Brazilian Coffee Scenes datasets demonstrate that our method is superior to the state of the art.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2705419","Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center on Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7934051","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs);mixed-resolution representation;remote sensing scene classification;vector of locally aggregated descriptors (VLAD)","Computer architecture;Convolutional codes;Feature extraction;Principal component analysis;Remote sensing;Semantics;Training","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;land cover;neural nets;principal component analysis;remote sensing","Brazilian Coffee scenes dataset;CNN;EMR;ImageNet dataset;ResNet;UC-Merced scenes dataset;VGG-VD;VLAD;convolutional neural networks;encoded mixed-resolution representation;hand-crafted descriptors;image classification;image feature extraction;principal component analysis;remote sensing image processing;remote sensing imagery;scale-invariant feature transform;scene classification;vector-of-locally aggregated descriptors","","","","","","Traditional","20170525","Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We model the cost of the utility companies from the demand-side regulation and give the condition of a unique optimal regulation price. For the multiple competing utility companies, we demonstrate that the retail pricing game belongs to the supermodular game and the game exists a pure Nash equilibrium.

The method integrates Bayes classification with simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) and then use the GrabCut method to obtain the segmentation. The SLIC is applied to cluster the features of a color image and integrated it into the GrabCut framework to overcome the problem of the image segmentation deterioration when the number of super pixels is low. In addition, we extend the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to SLIC features and GMM based on SLIC is constructed to describe the energy function. The color clustering can be suitably integrated into the GrabCut framework and fused with the color feature to achieve more superior image segmentation performance than the original GrabCut method. For easier implementation and more efficient computation, the Bayes classification is chosen for reconstruction of the simplified graph cut model instead of the original graph cut based on the SLIC model. The min-cut algorithm technique served as the division measure in the simplified image space for more discriminating power. A classification strategy is presented, to effectively adjust the energy function so that the Bayes classification and SLIC features are efficiently integrated to achieve more robust segmentation performance. Finally, boundary optimization is proposed to dramatically reduce the boundary roughness of the GrabCut algorithm with satisfactory segmentation accuracy. As a practical application, the superior performance of our proposed method was demonstrated through a large number of comparative tests.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2752221","International Science and technology cooperation project, Ministry of Education of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8037981","Bayes classification;GrabCut;SLIC;color image segmentation","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Color;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Mathematical model","Gaussian processes;feature extraction;graph theory;image colour analysis;image segmentation;iterative methods","Bayes classification;GMM;Gaussian mixture model;GrabCut algorithm;GrabCut color image segmentation;GrabCut framework;SLIC features;SLIC model;classification strategy;color clustering;color feature;color image segmentation algorithm;energy function;image segmentation deterioration;min-cut algorithm technique;segmentation degradation phenomenon;segmentation performance;simple linear iterative clustering;simplified graph cut model;simplified image space","","","","","","OAPA","20170914","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

How to efficiently implement scene recognition from high spatial resolution imagery remains a significant challenge in the remote sensing domain. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have attracted tremendous attention because of their excellent performance in different fields. However, most works focus on fully training a new deep CNN model for the target problems without considering the limited data and time-consuming issues. To alleviate the aforementioned drawbacks, some works have attempted to use the pretrained CNN models as feature extractors to build a feature representation of scene images for classification and achieved successful applications including remote sensing scene classification. However, existing works pay little attention to exploring the benefits of multilayer features for improving the scene classification in different aspects. As a matter of fact, the information hidden in different layers has great potential for improving feature discrimination capacity. Therefore, this paper presents a fusion strategy for integrating multilayer features of a pretrained CNN model for scene classification. Specifically, the pretrained CNN model is used as a feature extractor to extract deep features of different convolutional and fully connected layers; then, a multiscale improved Fisher kernel coding method is proposed to build a mid-level feature representation of convolutional deep features. Finally, the mid-level features extracted from convolutional layers and the features of fully connected layers are fused by a principal component analysis/spectral regression kernel discriminant analysis method for classification. For validation and comparison purposes, the proposed approach is evaluated via experiments with two challenging high-resolution remote sensing data sets, and shows the competitive perf- rmance compared with fully trained CNN models, fine-tuning CNN models, and other related works.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2017.2711275","Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7959553","Convolutional neural networks (CNN);feature fusion;improved Fisher kernel;scene classification;spectral regression kernel discriminant analysis (SRKDA)","Convolutional codes;Data mining;Feature extraction;Remote sensing;Semantics;Training;Visualization","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;neural nets;principal component analysis;regression analysis","CNN model;Fisher kernel coding method;convolutional neural networks;feature discrimination capacity;feature extractor;high spatial resolution imagery;image classification;principal component analysis-spectral regression kernel discriminant analysis method;remote sensing datasets;remote sensing images;remote sensing scene classification;scene recognition","","","","","","Traditional","20170627","Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Using cognitive dissonance as a teaching tool has been popular in STEM learning too. This paper presents a design for a cutting-edge different experiments where we describe a procedure that induces cognitive dissonance and different conditions that may boost the student's ability to overcome the STEM learning barriers. In our first experiment, we verified whether the STEM exercises that we will use for the future experiments may lead to the cognitive dissonance. Then, we tested whether using a motivational source (box containing a tablet) may encourage the student to strive for answering STEM exercises that were previously answered incorrectly. Cracking a joke has been proved to release the students from cognitive laziness. That is why, in our third experiment, we tested whether using an explicit joke or an implicit joke is better to encourage the student continue with answering the STEM exercises. As many researchers highlight the persuasive messages strategies usefulness in manipulating people towards new behaviors, in our fourth experiment, we managed to test whether using an implicit or an explicit persuasive message strategy is better. We compared as well whether it is better to use a joke or a persuasive message strategy to encourage the student continue with reanswering STEM exercises that were previously answered incorrectly. Finally, in our last study, we manipulated three factors which are the interaction level (dynamic or static), agency (a robot or a mascot) and timing (during or before gamma window) to choose finally the best combination boosting the student's strive for science learning.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-0958-3; POD:978-1-5386-0959-0","10.1109/CIT.2017.40","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8031451","STEM;learned helplessness;motivational intervention;persuasiveness;social robot","Education;Educational robots;Manipulator dynamics;Mood;Timing;Tools","cognition;computer aided instruction;educational robots;human computer interaction;human-robot interaction;knowledge acquisition;natural sciences;teaching","ROBOMO;STEM learning barriers;cognitive dissonance;cognitive laziness;explicit persuasive message strategy;knowledge acquisition;motivational intervention;science learning;social robots;teaching tool","","","","","","","","21-23 Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Being different from conventional passive late-remedy approaches, this is a positive and early-intervention strategy. Specifically, an evaluation function is designed to select appropriate start points (SPs) and end points (EPs) of super links, and the core idea is to transfer data from locations relatively far from the sink with a jump of data traffic to those near the sink with little data traffic.

With GLB, a cloud provider can achieve reduction of electricity cost or/and bandwidth cost or/and delay cost. However, these objectives are not independent from the others. In this paper, we first build an offline optimization-based framework to explore the trade-off among these three objectives under an emerging practical scenario, where the DCs are charged by peak pricing and burstable billing for energy consumption and bandwidth usage, respectively. It turns out that minimizing a specified cost may result in remarkable increases of other costs. Then, we propose a short-term prediction based mechanism (SPM) for the cloud provider to periodically deduce the request distribution strategies.

In this paper, an adaptive inter CU depth decision algorithm is proposed, which exploits both temporal correlation of CU depth and available encoding parameters. An optimal selection model of CU depth is established to estimate the range of candidate CU depth by exploiting the temporal correlation of CU depth among current CU and temporally co-located CUs. To reduce the accumulated errors in the process of CU depth prediction, the maximum depth of the co-located CUs and the coded block flag (CBF) of the current CU are used. Moreover, PU size and CBF information are also used to decide the maximum depth for the current CU. Experimental results show that the proposed CU depth decision approach reduces 56.3% and 51.5% average encoding time, and the Bjontegaard delta bit rate increases only 1.3% and 1.1% for various test sequences under the random access and the low delay B conditions, respectively.","0018-9316;00189316","","10.1109/TBC.2017.2704423","Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7940104","CU depth;High efficiency video coding (HEVC);coding unit (CU);prediction unit (PU)","Adaptation models;Bayes methods;Complexity theory;Copper;Correlation;Encoding;Video coding","encoding;video coding","Bjontegaard delta bit rate;CBF;CU depth prediction;H.264-AVC high profile;adaptive inter CU depth decision algorithm;coded block flag;coding efficiency;coding unit;computational complexity;encoding parameters;hierarchical coding structure;hierarchical unit partitioning strategy;high efficiency video coding;optimal selection model;prediction unit;temporal correlation","","","","","","","20170606","Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To verify the correctness of rules, we propose a lightweight rule verification and resolution framework which mainly include: 1) a rule verification system for content anomaly detection and rule conflict detection by using domain knowledge and probability analysis and 2) a quick resolution strategy for rule conflicts based on conflict-scenario-analysis. This framework can balance the verification quality with speed and guarantee that the rule system performs appropriately. Moreover, in order to reduce the comparison in rule verification, we apply a tree structure to store the building structure hierarchically and bind every rule to one node in the location tree.

Considering the good linear correlation of systolic BP (SBP) and the nonlinear correlation of diastolic BP (DBP) with PAT, a new BP estimation method was proposed. Ten subjects underwent BP monitoring experiments involving stationary sitting on a chair, lying on a bed, and pedaling using an ergometer in order to assess the accuracy of the estimated BP. A cuff-type BP monitor was used as reference in the experiments. Results showed that the mean difference of the estimated SBP and DBP was within 0.2 ± 5.8 mmHg (p <; 0.00001) and 0.4 ± 5.7 mmHg (p <; 0.00001), respectively, and the mean absolute difference of the estimated SBP and DBP were 4.4 and 4.6 mmHg, respectively, compared to references. Additionally, five subjects participated in data collections consisting of sitting on a chair twice a day for one month.

First, for wind speeds retrieved from vertical transmitting-vertical receiving (VV)-polarized images, the optimal geophysical C-band model (CMOD) function was selected among four CMOD functions. Second, the most suitable C-band cross-polarized ocean (C-2PO) model was selected between two C-2POs for the VH-polarized image data set. Then, the VH-wind speeds retrieved by the selected C-2PO were compared with the VV-polarized sea surface wind speeds retrieved using the optimal CMOD, which served as a reference, at different spatial resolutions. Results show that the VH-polarized wind speed retrieval accuracy increases rapidly with the decrease in spatial resolutions from 100 to 1000 m, with a drop in root-mean-square error of 42%. However, the improvement in wind speed retrieval accuracy levels off with spatial resolutions decreasing from 1000 to 5000 m. This demonstrates that the pixel spacing of 1 km may be the compromising choice for the tradeoff between the spatial resolution and wind speed retrieval accuracy with cross-polarized images obtained from RADASAT-2 fine quad-polarization mode.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2017.2700942","China Special Fund for Industrial and Scientific Research in the Public Interest (Meteorology); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8004492","Cross polarization;ocean surface wind;spatial resolution;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Sea measurements;Sea surface;Spatial resolution;Synthetic aperture radar;Wind speed","atmospheric techniques;image resolution;oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;sea level;set theory;synthetic aperture radar;wind","C-2PO model;C-band SAR polarization;C-band cross-polarized ocean model;CMOD function;RADASAT-2 fine quadpolarization mode;VH-polarized image data set;VH-wind speed;VV-polarized sea surface wind speed;cross-polarized synthetic aperture radar image;geophysical C-band model function;spatial resolution;spatial root-mean-square error resolution;spatial sea surface wind speed resolution;vertical transmitting-vertical receiving-polarized image;wind speed;wind speed retrieval","","","","","","","20170808","Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This workshop will help instructors of technical and professional writing define fake news for their students, identify the ways social media lends ethos to fake news, and give students a consistent method to separate fake news from credible information when the waters get murky. Since fake news in this form is a relatively new consideration, instructors must revise assignments and include fresh lesson plans to help students navigate these new waters. Understanding and developing strategies for teaching about fake news is particularly important for teachers of technical, scientific, and professional writing because fake news often targets topics that are relevant to students in these fields. Climate change, health, nutrition, and energy are often subjects of fake news. Moreover, predatory publishing and low standards of peer review make even research journals vulnerable to unsubstantiated research. In order to conduct meaningful research and create credible reports, students must be able to discern fact from fiction and to defend their choice of sources.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3042-2; POD:978-1-5090-3043-9","10.1109/IPCC.2017.8013972","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8013972","Fake news;assignments;credible information;teaching strategies","Conferences;Education;Meteorology;Navigation;Social network services;Voting;Writing","Internet;computer aided instruction;educational courses;information management;teaching","credible information assignments;educational course;fake news;misinformation age;online sharing;professional writing;student projects;teaching strategies;technical writing","","","","","","","","23-26 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we implement a big-data analytical framework for online behaviour modelling, particularly taking streaming data of students' online activity from their laptop usage as an illustrative example. The proposed framework covers details from accessing streaming records to storing heterogeneous data. Furthermore, the work also demonstrates the use of a TF-IDF based feature generation and fuzzy representation strategy to discover critical patterns via this behaviour data. The accuracy of the modelling work is evaluated using students' score on a national-wide test. Experimental results show that the employed TF-IDF feature is much stabler than other traditional features, thereby achieving a better modelling performance. In summary, the simulation result demonstrates the flexibility and applicability of the proposed framework for processing complex behaviour data, and revealing important patterns for decision making.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6034-4; POD:978-1-5090-6035-1; USB:978-1-5090-6033-7","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2017.8015451","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8015451","","Big Data;Data mining;Data structures;Education;Metadata","Big Data;Internet;computer aided instruction;teaching","Big Data analytical framework;TF-IDF based feature generation;complex behaviour data;critical patterns;fuzzy representation strategy;heterogeneous data;huge data volume;laptop usage;learning environment;live streaming data;modelling performance;modelling technology integration;online activity;online behaviour modelling;student behaviour data;student behaviour modelling;teaching","","","","","","","","9-12 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The placement prediction is more complex when the complexity of educational entities increase. Educational institutes look for more efficient technology that assist better management and support decision making procedures or assist them to set new strategies. One of the effective ways to address the challenges for improving the quality is to provide new knowledge related to the educational processes and entities to the managerial system. With the machine learning techniques the knowledge can be extracted from operational and historical data that resides within the educational organization's databases using. The dataset for system implementation contains information about past data of students. These data are used for training the model for rule identification and for testing the model for classification. This paper presents a recommendation system that predicts the students to have one of the five placement statuses, viz., Dream Company, Core Company, Mass Recruiters, Not Eligible and Not Interested in Placements. This model helps the placement cell within an organization to identify the prospective students and pay attention to and improve their technical as well as interpersonal skills. Furthermore, the students in pre-final and final years of their B. Tech course can also use this system to know their individual placement status that they are most likely to achieve.

However, most existing work on CDG mainly focuses on multihop relaying strategies to improve the performance of data gathering. In this paper, we propose a mobile CDG scheme including a random walk-based algorithm and a kernel-based method for sparsifying sensory data from irregular deployments. The proposed scheme allows a mobile collector to harvest data by sequentially visiting a number of nodes along a random path. More importantly, toward building the gap between CS and machine learning theories, we explore a theoretical foundation for understanding the feasibility of the proposed scheme. We prove that the CS matrices, constructed from the proposed random walk algorithm combined with a kernel-based sparsity basis, satisfy the restricted isometry property. Particularly, we also show that m=O(klog (n/k)) measurements collected by a mobile collector are sufficient to recover a k-sparse signal and t=O(klog (n/k)) steps are required to collect these measurements in a network with n nodes. Finally, we also present extensive numerical results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme by evaluating the performance in terms of energy consumption and the impact of packet losses. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is able to not only significantly reduce communication cost but also combat unreliable wireless links under various packet losses compared to the state-of-the-art schemes, which provides an efficient alternative to data relaying approaches for CDG in WSNS.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMC.2017.2734886","China Scholarship Council; Cross-Strait Joint Fund of National Natural Science Foundation of China; Fujian Collaborative Innovation Center for Big Data Application in Governments the Technology Innovation Platform Project of Fujian Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8013710","Compressive sensing (CS);Gaussian kernel;machine learning theory;mobile data gathering;random walk;wireless sensor network systems (WSNSs)","Loss measurement;Machine learning algorithms;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Routing;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","","","20170821","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To this end, two low-complexity, suboptimal, yet efficient, relay-destination selection schemes are proposed, namely direct links plus opportunistic channel state information (CSI)-based selection (DOS) scheme and direct links plus partial CSI-based selection (DPS) scheme. Considering three relaying strategies, i.e., decode-and-forward (DF), variable-gain amplify-and-forward (VG-AF), and fixed-gain amplify-and-forward (FG-AF), the performance analysis in terms of outage probability (OP) is carried out for each selection scheme. For the DF and VG-AF strategies, exact analytical expressions and tight closed-form approximate expressions for the OP are derived. For the FG-AF strategy, an exact closed-form expression for the OP is provided. Additionally, we propose a gradient-based search method to find the optimal values of the power-splitting ratio that minimizes the attained OPs. The developed analysis is corroborated through Monte Carlo simulation. Comparisons with the optimal joint selection scheme are performed and it is shown that the proposed schemes significantly reduce the amount of channel estimations while achieving comparable outage performance. In addition, regardless of relaying strategy used, numerical results show that the DOS scheme achieves full diversity gain, i.e., M + K, and the DPS scheme achieves the diversity gain of M+1, where M and K are the numbers of destinations and relays, respectively.","1536-1276;15361276","","10.1109/TWC.2017.2710307","Vietnam National Foundation for Science and Technology Development; 10.13039/501100000266 - U.K. Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; 10.13039/501100000287 - U.K. Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellowship; 10.13039/501100003621 - Leading Human Resource Training Program of Regional Neo Industry through the National Research Foundation of Korea through the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning; 10.13039/501100003725 - Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea through the Ministry of Education; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7945528","Cooperative networks;RF energy harvesting;opportunistic scheduling;outage performance;power-splitting;relay-destination selection;simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)","Cooperative systems;Diversity methods;Energy harvesting;Protocols;Radio frequency;Relays;Wireless communication","Monte Carlo methods;amplify and forward communication;cooperative communication;decode and forward communication;gradient methods;probability;relay networks (telecommunication);telecommunication scheduling","DOS scheme;DPS scheme;FG-AF;Monte Carlo simulation;VG-AF;channel estimations;decode-and-forward;direct links plus opportunistic CSI-based selection scheme;direct links plus opportunistic channel state information-based selection scheme;direct links plus partial CSI-based selection scheme;downlink outage performance;dual-hop cooperative networks;exact analytical expressions;fixed-gain amplify-and-forward;full diversity gain;gradient-based search method;multiple radio-frequency energy harvesting relays;opportunistic scheduling;outage probability;relay-destination selection schemes;tight closed-form approximate expressions;variable-gain amplify-and-forward","","","","","","","20170609","Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These different effects may cause overcompensation or undercompensation to torque and flux linkage leading to large torque and flux linkage ripples in the IPMSM DTC systems. A novel duty ratio modulation strategy for the IPMSM DTC systems is presented, which considers these differences that are ignored in conventional duty ratio modulation strategies. The proposed duty ratio modulation strategy aims at minimizing torque ripple and flux linkage ripple, which makes sure that the control system can work in an optimum state. The active angle, the impact angle, the active factor, and the impact factor are first introduced. The active angel and the impact angle are used to get the active factor and the impact factor, respectively. Every sector is divided into five small sectors based on the impact angels, and then, a switching table is redesigned according to the small sectors division. Also, the vector selection rules for the redesigned switching table are described in details. Subsequently, an optimal duty ratio can be derived through the simplified duty ratio determination method.

However, both theoretical and experimental evidence have shown that very large ensembles are not necessarily superior, and small ensembles can often achieve better results. In this paper, we show how to combine a set of weak classifiers into a robust ensemble by using a joint sparse representation method, which assigns a sparse coefficient vector to the decision of each classifier. The sparse vector contains many zero entries, and thus the final ensemble only employs a small number of classifiers, corresponding to non-zero entries. Training data are partitioned into several sub-groups to generate sub-underdetermined systems. The joint sparse method enables these sub-groups to then share their information about individual classifiers, to obtain an improved overall classification. Partitioning the training dataset into subgroups makes the proposed joint sparse ensemble method parallelizable, making it suitable for large scale problems. In contrast, previous work on sparse approaches to ensemble learning was limited to datasets smaller than the number of classifiers. Two different strategies are described for generating the sub-underdetermined systems, and experiments show these to be effective when tested with two different data manipulation methods. Experiments evaluate the performance of the joint sparse ensemble learning method in comparison to five other state-of-the-art methods from the literature, each designed to train small and efficient ensembles. Results suggest that joint sparse ensemble learning outperforms other algorithms on most datasets.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2679-5; POD:978-1-5386-2680-1; USB:978-1-5386-2678-8","10.1109/ICCA.2017.8003205","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8003205","","Bagging;Biological system modeling;Data models;Mathematical model;Optimization methods;Prediction algorithms;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;vectors","classification ensemble;data manipulation methods;joint sparse ensemble learning method;joint sparse representation method;sparse coefficient vector;subunderdetermined systems;weak classifiers","","","","","","","","3-6 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we conduct a survey and build the taxonomy on current existing energy efficiency relevant surveys, that is, a survey on surveys of energy efficiency. We classify current existing surveys into five categories, including surveys on the energy efficiency of the whole cloud related systems, surveys on energy efficiency of the certain level or component of the cloud, surveys on all of energy efficient strategies, surveys on a certain energy efficiency techniques, and other energy efficiency related surveys. The survey and taxonomy on the energy efficient relevant surveys conducted in this paper provide comprehensive knowledge on the current level of this research filed.

However, in the fuzzy setting, game graphs are yet to be addressed, although some practical applications, such as modeling fuzzy systems that interact with their environments, appeal to such models. To fill the gap, in this paper, we propose a fuzzy version of game graphs and focus on the fuzzy game graphs with reachability objectives, which we will refer to as fuzzy reachability games (FRGs). In an FRG, the goal of one player is to maximize her truth value of reaching a given target set, while the other player aims at the opposite. In this framework, we show that FRGs are determined in the sense that for every state, both of the two players have the same value, and there exist optimal memoryless strategies for both players. Moreover, we design algorithms, which achieve polynomial time complexity in the size of the FRG, to compute the values of all states and the optimal memoryless strategies for the players. For a special class of FRGs, we provide an improved algorithm that achieves linear-logarithmic running time to compute the values of states. In addition, several examples are given to illustrate our motivation and the theoretical development.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2016.2593495","Higher School Doctoral Subject Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002858 - China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7517395","Fuzzy automaton;fuzzy logic;fuzzy transition system (FTS);game graph;reachability","Automata;Computational modeling;Computer science;Fuzzy systems;Games;Stochastic processes;Uncertainty","computational complexity;fuzzy set theory;game theory;probability;reachability analysis","FRGs;computer science;formal verification;fuzzy game graphs;fuzzy reachability games;linear-logarithmic running time;optimal memoryless strategies;polynomial time complexity;probabilistic versions;reactive systems;two-player turn-based games","","","","","","","20160720","Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This combination provides an accelerated implementation on graphics processing unit (GPU), and the proposed method is, therefore, referred to as G-DPSORE. In G-DPSO-RE, a dynamic labor division strategy is incorporated into the swarms according to the designed evolutionary factor during the evolution process. Two novel modifications of the movement equation are designed to update the velocity of particles. Moreover, a chaotic-logistic-based immune RE operator is developed to facilitate the global best individual (gBest particle) to explore a potentially better region. Furthermore, a GPU parallel acceleration technique is utilized to speed up parameter estimation procedure. It has been demonstrated that the proposed method is effective for simultaneous estimation of the PMSM parameters and the disturbance voltage (V<sub>dead</sub>) due to VSI nonlinearity from experimental data for currents and rotor speed measured with inexpensive equipment.

Moreover, for the energy harvesting and social-aware relay that assists the cooperative transmission protocol, we propose two different relay selection strategies, that is, social-aware random relay selection and social-aware best relay selection. The outage probability and network throughput of the proposed protocols are derived in a closed form using the stochastic geometry model, where the multiple M2M transmitter-receiver pairs and relays form independent homogeneous Poisson point processes, respectively.

In this paper, we present an alternative approach to steganalysis of digital images based on convolutional neural network (CNN), which is shown to be able to well replicate and optimize these key steps in a unified framework and learn hierarchical representations directly from raw images. The proposed CNN has a quite different structure from the ones used in conventional computer vision tasks. Rather than a random strategy, the weights in the first layer of the proposed CNN are initialized with the basic high-pass filter set used in the calculation of residual maps in a spatial rich model (SRM), which acts as a regularizer to suppress the image content effectively. To better capture the structure of embedding signals, which usually have extremely low SNR (stego signal to image content), a new activation function called a truncated linear unit is adopted in our CNN model. Finally, we further boost the performance of the proposed CNN-based steganalyzer by incorporating the knowledge of selection channel. Three state-of-the-art steganographic algorithms in spatial domain, e.g., WOW, S-UNIWARD, and HILL, are used to evaluate the effectiveness of our model.

Therefore, the analysis of crowd aggregation behavior has been a new research focus in the field of intelligent video surveillance. However, such public area scenes not only contain moving crowd but also contain other types of objects. The sizes of these objects are usually small, which make their appearances quite similar. Moreover, the individuals in a crowd move randomly and often occlude each other. All the above factors make the analysis of crowd aggregation very difficult. In this paper, the authors attempt to solve this problem in three aspects. Firstly, a novel global feature is used to represent the moving crowd. This feature can well describe the spatial and the temporal motion information of points-of-interest. Then, a strategy is adopted to cluster the feature points firstly and then calculate the collectiveness. This makes the collectiveness computation of individual groups more consistent and effective. Finally, more comprehensive collective crowd descriptors are proposed to provide a detailed description of the crowd status. Based on the proposed descriptor, the authors realize the evolution analysis of the group movement and the crowd abnormal detection. The experiment results show that the proposed method is able to efficiently compute the crowd collectiveness in various public areas and provide a reliable reference for the public safety management.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2017.2731866","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7990566","abnormal detection;collectiveness computation;crowd movement;global feature extraction;movement evolution","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Dynamics;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Tracking;Trajectory","","","","","","","","","20170725","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The M-FCN uses a cascade strategy that consists of an FCN-based coarse candidate extraction stage, a multi-Markov random field (multi-MRF)-based region proposal (RP) generation stage, and a final classification stage. In the first stage, the FCN model is trained to be sensitive to airplanes, and a coarse candidate map is generated. This model is scale-, direction-, and color-invariant and does not require many training examples. After the first stage, the coarse candidate map is used as the initial labeling field for a multi-MRF algorithm, and RPs are generated according to the multi-MRF output. This RP-generating strategy can yield more accurate locations with fewer RPs.

Understanding the three-dimensional (3-D) wind fields in TCs helps in assimilating their dynamics and predicting their evolution. Unfortunately, up to now, there is no spaceborne weather radar with Doppler capability to measure the 3-D wind components in the global scale. This paper presents a novel scanning strategy for future spaceborne Doppler weather radar mission to retrieve 3-D wind fields of TCs, which has three downward-pointing (with three different fixed tilt angles) and conically scanning beams. With spaceborne Doppler detection, the radar system enables to measure the vertical motion of hydrometeors, which is important in the estimation of latent heat fluxes and in the study of energy transportation in the structure of TCs on a global scale. A novel scanning strategy is presented and optimized to construct three noncollinear radar observations. Three-dimensional wind fields are retrieved using the least-squares method. A model simulation of TCs is used to validate the proposed scanning strategy. The radar beams of the proposal are able to cover TC's full area of interest. The results demonstrate a suitable accuracy of the proposed scanning strategy on retrieving the TC's 3-D wind fields with a resolution of 10 km × 10 km × 0.25 km grid cell, showing a promising use in the future spaceborne Doppler radar.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2017.2672826","China Commonweal Industry Research Project; National Basic Research Program of China; Open Research Funding Program of KLGIS; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; Research and Innovation Project for College Graduates of Jiangsu Province of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7879220","Scanning strategy;spaceborne Doppler weather radar (SDWR);tropical cyclones (TCs);wind retrieval","Doppler effect;Doppler radar;Meteorological radar;Spaceborne radar;Wind","Doppler radar;least squares approximations;meteorological radar;remote sensing by radar;storms;wind","3D wind field;TC structure;coastal regions;hydrometeors;latent heat flux estimation;least-squares method;radar beams;radar system;scanning strategy;spaceborne Doppler detection;spaceborne Doppler weather radar mission;tropical cyclones","","","","","","","20170315","June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The development of multi-robot system (MRS) provides new tools and theories to solve this problem. Among related works, the leader-follower strategy is famous for its simplicity and efficiency. Based on leader graphic theory, this paper proposes a neuroendocrine system inspired dynamic leader selection model (NeDLSM) to autonomously switch leaders as such helping the team get out of the woods. A fuzzy C-means algorithm is employed to simulate a nervous system in NeDLSM to evaluate states of robots by fusing external information and status of robots themselves. The neuroendocrine regulation mechanism is referred to adjust two kinds of hormones, which are defined as the specific properties of the leader and the followers, respectively. A superior concentration of hormones will trigger the leader re-selection process. Numerical simulation results show that the MRS with NeDLSM can decrease the convergence error significantly and maintain a required formation in a complex environment.","","CD:978-1-5090-4656-0; Electronic:978-1-5090-4657-7; POD:978-1-5090-4658-4","10.1109/CCDC.2017.7979466","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7979466","Multi-robot system;follow leader;formation control;leader selection;neuroendocrine regulation","Biochemistry;Convergence;Glands;Multi-robot systems;Nervous system;Robot sensing systems","convergence;fuzzy set theory;multi-robot systems;neurophysiology","MRS;NeDLSM;convergence error;external information;formation control;fuzzy C-means algorithm;leader graphic theory;leader reselection process;leader-follower strategy;multirobot system;nervous system;neuroendocrine inspired dynamic leader selection model;neuroendocrine regulation mechanism;robot status","","","","","","","","28-30 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two tools were designed to help the students to study MCU based on PBL: a virtual Proteus simulation and a real setup. Using Proteus VSM, software development can begin as soon as the schematic is drawn, and the combination of hardware and software can be thoroughly tested before physical prototype is constructed. The combination of virtual and real setups can realize seamless connection between theory and practice, both virtual and real setups are described by example, and the results obtained by the students are discussed. Students gain hands-on experience, and also improve their skill in product development, self-directed learning, teamwork, and project management. Practical projects increase the challenge for students and, hence, their interest level.

Much research in recent years has focused on how to obtain the accurate tracking results. However, few researchers have addressed the problem of the smoothness for the tracking trajectory. Most trajectory results are skipped and lack of smoothness, which does not comply with human vision habits. Also, some incorrect data has been recorded in the final trajectory due to the problem of partial occlusion. In this paper, we proposed a strategy to fix the present tracking trajectory. First, we detect and delete the anomaly tracking data. Second, we use a technique of supervised learning to do the linear regression for reconciling the tracking trajectory.

We consider both the single-channel multijammer (SCMJ) model and the multichannel single-jammer (MCSJ) model. We investigate the interaction between the source that transmits secret information and friendly jammer nodes who assist the source by interfering with the eavesdropper. This problem is formulated as an oligopoly market consisting of a few firms and a buyer. By modeling the problem as a Bertrand game based on price competition, we obtain the optimal pricing scheme for the friendly, while for selfish jammers, the utility of those jammers is maximized. For the SCMJ model, we prove the existence of Bertrand Equilibrium by deriving a closed-form expression for the optimal price strategy. For the MCSJ model, a closed-form expression for power allocation is derived, based on which a new algorithm is designed to obtain the optimal strategy of the jammer. Finally, via simulations, we verify our theoretical analysis.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2016.2639827","National Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; Open Research Fund of the Key Laboratory of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Network Technology (NUPT); Qinlan Project of Jiangsu Province; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; 10.13039/501100005374 - NUPT; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7782794","Bertrand game;eavesdropping;game theory;jamming;security;wireless networks","Game theory;Games;Jamming;Physical layer;Security;Wireless networks","game theory;jamming;pricing;radio networks","Bertrand equilibrium;Bertrand game approach;MCSJ model;SCMJ model;antieavesdropping;closed-form expression;multichannel single-jammer;oligopoly market;optimal price strategy;optimal pricing scheme;physical layer security;power allocation;price competition;selfish jammers;selfish jamming;single-channel multijammer;wireless communications;wireless networks","","","","","","","20161214","July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this problem, the wireless channel suffers from quantization noise and packet loss while the data for remote estimation are transferred from the transmitter to the receiver; these phenomena degrade remote estimation of the system state. To determine the transmission strategy under these phenomena, we propose the remote estimation that is designed to minimize the estimate error variance (EEV) between the real state and the remote estimate of one. To achieve this goal, we design the linear encoder and the corresponding quantizer. Finally, we construct remote estimator recursions for the determined linear encoder and quantizer. In simulations, the proposed remote estimator is shown to achieve lower averaged time-tracking EEV than the existing scheme.","","","10.1109/LCSYS.2017.2717865","Human Resource Training Program for Regional Innovation and Creativity through the Ministry of Education and National Research Foundation of Korea; 10.13039/501100003621 - ICT Consilience Creative Program under the Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion through MSIP; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7954669","Estimation;Kalman filtering;control over communications;observers for linear systems;quantized systems","Estimation;Packet loss;Quantization (signal);Receivers;Transmitters;Wireless communication","Kalman filters;control system synthesis;linear systems;telecommunication control;wireless channels","EEV;Kalman filtering;capacity-limited channel;estimate error variance;linear encoder design;linear systems;lossy channel;quantized systems;quantizer;remote estimation;remote estimator recursions;wireless channel","","","","","","","20170621","Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The main documents identify main weaknesses and risk areas. One of the most significant was described as the early school leaving of Roma minority members. Roma constitute Europe's largest transnational ethnic minority with an estimate of ten million people. Learning outcomes of this minority are significantly lower than outcomes of the majority. As one of the reasons for early school leaving of Roma, insufficient understanding of learning materials is identified. The result is that most of the Roma community members drop out of education before attending a secondary school and continue their lives as unemployed or enter the labor market as unskilled workers.

Due to the inherent conflicts, however, simultaneously achieving optimum on all these properties is impractical. N-way Replication and Erasure Coding, two extensively-applied storage schemes with high reliability, adopt opposite and unbalanced strategies on the tradeoff among these properties, thus considerably restraining their effectiveness on wide range of workloads. To address the aforementioned obstacle, we propose a novel storage scheme called ASSER, an ASSembling chain of Erasure coding and Replication. ASSER stores each object in two parts: a full copy and a certain amount of erasure-coded segments. We establish dedicated read/write protocols for ASSER leveraging the unique structural advantages. On the basis of elementary protocols, we implement sequential and PRAM (Pipeline-RAM) consistency to make ASSER feasible for various services with different performance/consistency requirements. Evaluation results demonstrate that under the same fault tolerance and consistency level, ASSER outperforms N-way replication and pure erasure coding in I/O throughput under diverse system and workload configurations with superior performance stability. More importantly, ASSER delivers stably efficient I/O performance at much lower storage cost than the other comparatives.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2017.2671871","Ministry of Education of China; National Science and Technology Supporting Program of China; New-Century Excellent Talents Program; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100000923 - Australian Research Council; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7859394","ASSER;cost-effective;efficient;object-based storage;reliable","Cloud computing;Encoding;Fault tolerance;Multiprotocol label switching;Phase change random access memory;Servers","cloud computing;concurrency theory;input-output programs;storage management","ASSER;I/O performance;N-way replication;PRAM;assembling chain of erasure coding and replication;cost-effective storage scheme;object-based cloud storage systems;pipeline-RAM;reliable storage scheme","","","","","","","20170220","Aug. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Handling scheduling uncertainties through traffic shaping in Time-Triggered train networks","Qinghan Yu; Xibin Zhao; Hai Wan; Yue Gao; Chenyang Lu; Ming Gu","Key Laboratory for Information System Security, Ministry of Education, China","2017 IEEE/ACM 25th International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS)","20170707","2017","","","1","6","While trains traditionally relied on field bus to support real-time control applications, next-generation trains are moving toward Ethernet as an integrated, high-bandwidth communication infrastructure for real-time control and best-effort consumer traffic. Time-Triggered Ethernet (TT-Ethernet) is a promising technology for train networks because of its capability to achieve deterministic latencies for real-time applications based on pre-computed transmission schedules. However, the deterministic scheduling approach of TT-Ethernet faces significant challenges in handling scheduling uncertainties caused by switch failures and legacy end devices in train networks. Due to the physical constraints on trains, train networks deal with switch failures by bypassing failed switches using a short circuiting mechanism. Unfortunately, this mechanism incurs scheduling errors as frames bypassing the failed switch may arrive ahead of the pre-computed schedule, resulting in early, unexpected, and out of order arrivals. Furthermore, as trains evolve from traditional communication technologies to TT-Ethernet, the network must support legacy end devices that may generate frames at times unknown to the TT-Ethernet. We propose a novel traffic shaping approach to deal with scheduling uncertainties in TT-Ethernet. The traffic shaper of a TT-Ethernet switch buffers early frames and then releases them at their pre-scheduled arrive time. Furthermore, we devise an efficient buffer management method for the traffic shaper in face of fault scenarios. Finally, we use the traffic shaper to integrate legacy devices into TT-Ethernet. We have implemented the traffic shaping approach in a 24-port TT-Ethernet switch specifically designed for train networks. Experiments show the traffic shaping strategy can effectively deal with scheduling uncertainties incurred by switch failures and legacy devices.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2704-4; POD:978-1-5386-2705-1","10.1109/IWQoS.2017.7969171","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7969171","","Out of order;Ports (Computers);Real-time systems;Redundancy;Schedules;Switches;Uncertainty","buffer storage;computer network reliability;next generation networks;railway communication;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","24- port TT-Ethernet switch buffers;best-effort consumer traffic;buffer management method;deter- ministic scheduling approach;deterministic latency;fault scenarios;integrated high-bandwidth communication infrastructure;next-generation trains;precomputed transmission scheduling;real-time applications;real-time control;real-time control application;scheduling uncertainty handling;short circuiting mechanism;switch failures;time-triggered Ethernet;time-triggered train networks;traffic shaping;traffic shaping approach","","","","","","","","14-16 June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A subset of relays using alternate relaying is opportunistically selected in terms of producing the minimum total interference level, thereby resulting in network decoupling. As our main result, it is shown that under a certain relay scaling condition, the OND protocol achieves K degrees of freedom even in the presence of interfering links among relays. Numerical evaluation is also shown to validate the performance of the proposed OND. Our protocol basically operates in a fully distributed fashion along with local channel state information, thereby resulting in relatively easy implementation.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2016.2614979","10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; 10.13039/501100003621 - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning (MSIP); 10.13039/501100003725 - National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7582492","<named-content xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xmlns:ali=""http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/"" xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" content-type=""math"" xlink:type=""simple""> <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$K\times N\times K$</tex-math> <alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""yang-ieq5-2614979.gif"" xlink:type=""simple""/> </alternatives> </inline-formula> </named-content> channel;Degrees of freedom (DoF);half-duplex;interference;opportunistic network decoupling (OND);relay;virtual full-duplex (FD)","Channel models;Interference channels;Mobile computing;Protocols;Relays;Signal to noise ratio","numerical analysis;radio links;radiofrequency interference;relay networks (telecommunication);telecommunication scheduling;wireless channels","OND protocol;achievability scheme;half-duplex relays;local channel state information;multisource interfering relay networks;numerical evaluation;opportunistic network decoupling;performance validation;relay scheduling strategy;relays subset;source-destination pairs;virtual full-duplex operation","","","","","","","20161004","Aug. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The first one aims at identifying a CT scanner based on an original sensor pattern noise (OSPN) that is intrinsic to the X-ray detectors. The second one identifies an acquisition system based on the way this noise is modified by its three-dimensional (3-D) image reconstruction algorithm. As these reconstruction algorithms are manufacturer dependent and kept secret, our features are used as input to train a support vector machine (SVM) based classifier to discriminate acquisition systems. Experiments conducted on images issued from 15 different CT-scanner models of 4 distinct manufacturers demonstrate that our system identifies the origin of one CT image with a detection rate of at least 94% and that it achieves better performance than sensor pattern noise (SPN) based strategy proposed for general public camera devices.","2168-2194;21682194","","10.1109/JBHI.2016.2575398","¿¿¿333¿¿¿ Project; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100004608 - Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7487061","Computed tomography (CT);image origin identification;sensor pattern noise (SPN);three-dimensional (3-D) image reconstruction algorithm","Biomedical imaging;Computed tomography;Filtering algorithms;Image reconstruction;Reconstruction algorithms;Three-dimensional displays;X-ray imaging","computerised tomography;diagnostic radiography;feature extraction;image reconstruction;medical image processing;noise;support vector machines","3-D image reconstruction;CT;OSPN;SPN;SVM;X-ray detectors;computed tomography;image chain acquisition;image origin identification;original sensor pattern noise;sensor pattern noise;support vector machine","","","","","","","20160608","July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Based on the analysis on the procedure of task processing, this paper proposes a CMF scheduling model for efficiently exploiting distributed resources, so industrial robots in different enterprises can cooperatively handle a batch of tasks. Specifically, this paper considers the performance of four robot deployment methods, including random deployment, robot-balanced deployment, function-balanced deployment, and location-aware deployment. Furthermore, three subtask-scheduling strategies are derived for three optimization objectives, including load-balance of robots, minimizing overall cost, and minimizing overall processing time. Moreover, these strategies are implemented by genetic algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that each strategy can achieve the relevant optimization objective. In addition, the results also show that the physical distance between two enterprises can influence the overall cost, and location-aware deployment leads to smaller transportation cost.

While effective in canceling interference, vectoring does incur major communication overhead and computational overhead in terms of the transmission of idle symbols and precoder-data multiplications at each data frame, resulting in significant energy consumption when the number of lines is large. To facilitate energy efficient transmission, it has been recently proposed (in the G.fast standard) that each data frame is divided into a normal operating interval (NOI) and a discontinuous operating interval (DOI). In the NOI, all lines (or users) are involved in a common vectoring group, which requires a large matrix precoder, whereas in the DOI, the lines are subdivided into multiple small nonoverlapping vectoring subgroups and are transmitted in a time division multiple access manner, requiring small matrix multiplications and, thus, improving the energy efficiency. In this paper, we consider the key dynamic resource allocation problems in downlink DSL: given the real-time demands, determine the optimal transmission scheme: The optimal NOI and DOI size in each data frame as well as the optimal grouping strategy in the DOI, and optimally adjust the transmission scheme. We formulate these optimal dynamic resource allocation problems and propose efficient real-time algorithms to solve them to global optimality.

Followers send out unsatisfied signals when they are disappointed at the current leader. The abashment value of the leader changes with its own status as well as the number of unsatisfied signals received from its followers. When its abashment value goes beyond a given threshold, a leader reselection process is triggered. Moreover, a swap-greedy algorithm is proposed to approximate the optimal solution for confirming the leader-follower relationship, which can be described as a combinatorial optimization problem to minimize the total travel distance of all the robots. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed model can improve the probability of a robot team escaping from local extreme points significantly, and even in the case of leader failure, the team can reselect a leader autonomously and keep moving toward the target.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMC.2016.2564931","Cooperative Research Funds of the National Natural Science Funds Overseas and Hong Kong and Macao Scholars; Project of the Shanghai Committee of Science and Technology; Shanghai Pujiang Program; Specialized Research Fund for Shanghai Leading Talents; 10.13039/100010002 - Program for Changjiang Scholars from the Ministry of Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100003395 - Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7534738","Affection model;formation control;leader selection;multirobot system (MRS)","Adaptation models;Collision avoidance;Controllability;Convergence;Cybernetics;Multi-robot systems;Robots","combinatorial mathematics;fuzzy control;fuzzy reasoning;greedy algorithms;minimisation;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;probability","affection-based dynamic leader selection model;combinatorial optimization problem;formation control;fuzzy inference system;leader abashment value;leader reselection process;leader-follower strategies;multirobot systems;probability;robot travel distance minimization;swap-greedy algorithm","","","","","","","20160805","July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In addition, we also provide the settling time for stabilization which has an important significance in the application of neural networks for guaranteeing fast response. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategies and main results.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMC.2017.2657784","10.13039/100009377 - Scientific Research Youth Project of Hunan Provincial Education Department; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100004735 - Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7847450","Adaptive control strategy;delayed neural networks (DNNs);discontinuous activation;finite-time stabilization (FTS);state-feedback control strategy","Adaptive control;Biological neural networks;Convergence;Differential equations;Neurons;Switches","Lyapunov methods;adaptive control;control system synthesis;delays;neurocontrollers;sampled data systems;stability;state feedback;switching systems (control)","Lyapunov functional method;control strategy design;delayed neural networks;differential inclusions theory;discontinuous DNNs;discontinuous delayed networks;discontinuous neuron activations;finite-time stability theorem;finite-time stabilization;novel adaptive control;switching adaptive control;switching state-feedback control","","","","","","","20170208","July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The tree structure which is generated by the segmentation strategy directly determines the final results for this kind of algorithms. However, the original strategy performs unreasonable due to its coarse performance and ignores to meet the disparity consistency assumption. To improve these weaknesses we propose a novel segmentation algorithm for constructing a more faithful ST with enhanced segmentation advantage according to a robust initial over-segmentation. Then we implement non-local cost aggregation framework on this new ST structure and obtain improved disparity maps.

The system consists of two energy-constrained source nodes which employ the power splitting (PS) to receive the information and the energy simultaneously from the power-supply relay. To maximize the weighted sum energy subject to the constraints of the quality of service and the transmit powers, three well-known relaying protocols, i.e., amplify-and-forward, bit level XOR-based decode-and-forward (DF), and symbol level superposition coding-based DF, are considered. For each relaying protocol, we formulate the joint relay beamforming, the source transmit power, and the PS ratios optimization as a nonconvex quadratically constrained problem. To solve the complex nonconvex problem, we decouple the objective problem into two subproblems in which one is to optimize the beamforming vectors while another is to optimize the remaining parameters. We show that the optimal solution of each subproblem can be obtained in the closed-form expressions. The solution is finally obtained with the proposed convergent iterative algorithm.

The existing machine learning-based prediction methods commonly adopt offline working pattern, which cannot be used for online prediction in practical operations, in which data arrive sequentially. To solve this problem, a new method based on online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) is proposed in this paper to predict online job termination status. With this method, real-time data are collected according to the sequence of job arriving, the job status could be predicted and the operation model is thus updated based on these data. The method with online incremental learning strategy has fast learning speed and good generalization. Comparative study using Google trace data shows that prediction accuracy of the proposed method is 93% with updating model in 0.01 s. Compared with some state-of-the-art methods, such, as support vector machine (SVM), ELM, and OS-SVM, the method developed in this paper has many advantages, such as less time-consuming in establishing and updating the model, higher prediction accuracy and precision, and better false negative performance.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2706740","Key Science and Technology Program of Henan Province; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China; National Science-Technology Support Plan Projects; Natural Science Research Projects of the Department of Education of Henan Province; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7932064","Cloud cluster;OS-ELM model;jobs termination status;online predicting;the Google cluster traces","Computational modeling;Data models;Google;Predictive models;Real-time systems;Support vector machines","cloud computing;computer centres;learning (artificial intelligence);resource allocation;system recovery","Google trace data;OS-ELM;compute cloud;disposal steps;job failure prediction;large-scale data center;machine learning-based prediction methods;offline working pattern;online incremental learning strategy;online job termination status prediction;online sequential extreme learning machine;operation model;resource utilization;time 0.01 s","","","","","","OAPA","20170519","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A cyber network connects each robot, sensor, and smart machine to achieve high velocity, flexibility of procedures, and real-time information exchange.

This algorithm solves the difficult 3-D Multiple Bin Size Bin Packing Problem (3-DMBSBPP) by integrating an adaptive PSO-based configuration algorithm. Our simulation results show that the packing algorithm can deploy items appropriately, with all items packed inside their box without overlap and with an overall center-of-gravity close to the bottom center of the box. When all the items cannot be packed into a single box, the proposed dividing strategies split the items into groups to pack into two or more boxes of similar size. Furthermore, comparing with the real packages we assessed, the proposed algorithm has a competitive performance.

In the proposed control strategy, wind power is smoothed with flexible reference output and self-adjustable battery state of charge ranges, and then, the battery can be utilized without overdischarge. Meanwhile, the smoothed wind power with longer average interval duration can better benefit the wind power trading in electricity market. Besides, the charge/discharge switch can be significantly decreased to prolong the battery lifetime. Afterward, based on the presented control strategy, the sizing methodology is proposed according to the cumulative probability function of the charge/discharge power and energy.

For each CU, an exhaustive mode decision strategy is adopted to achieve the best rate distortion (RD) cost, which simultaneously results in enormous computational complexity. In this paper, an early SKIP mode decision algorithm is proposed for the HEVC encoder to speed up the process of mode decision. Each CU size is categorized into either rare used or frequent used by exploiting the correlation of CU depth, which is estimated from the temporally colocated CUs. For the rare-used CU size, the SKIP mode is directly selected as the optimal mode and the remaining mode decision process is early terminated. For the frequent-used CU size, a unimodal stopping model is designed for its early SKIP mode decision by exploiting both hierarchical mode structure and RD cost property. Experimental results show that the proposed early SKIP mode decision method achieves average 58.5% and 54.8% encoding time savings, while the Bjontegaard Delta bit rate only increases average 0.8% and 0.8% for various test sequences under the random access and the low delay B conditions, respectively.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2017.2669863","Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center on Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higer Education Institutions; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7857045","High efficiency video coding (HEVC);SKIP mode;mode decision;unimodal stopping model (USM)","Computational complexity;Copper;Correlation;Encoding;High efficiency video coding;Video sequences","computational complexity;rate distortion theory;video coding","Bjontegaard Delta bit rate;HEVC encoder;computational complexity;early SKIP mode decision;hierarchical coding structures;high-efficiency video coding;rate distortion cost;unimodal stopping model","","","","","","","20170215","July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The small-signal model of the BGC system is established, and the small-signal transfer function between the dc bus voltage and the dc output current of the BGC is deduced. The dynamic characteristic of the dc bus voltage with power fluctuation in the DC-MG is analyzed in detail. As a result, the dc output current of the BGC is equivalent to a disturbance, which affects the dynamic response of the dc bus voltage. For this reason, a dc output current feedforward disturbance suppressing method for the BGC is introduced to smooth the dynamic response of the dc bus voltage. By analyzing the control system stability, the appropriate virtual inertia control parameters are selected. Finally, simulations and experiments verified the validity of the proposed control strategy.","0278-0046;02780046","","10.1109/TIE.2016.2645898","Scientific Research Fund of the Hunan Provincial Education Department; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7801819","Bidirectional grid-connected converter (BGC);dc microgrid (DC-MG);disturbance suppressing;power fluctuation;small-signal modeling;virtual inertia control","Energy storage;Fluctuations;Microgrids;Power system stability;Stability analysis;Synchronous machines;Voltage control","distributed power generation;power convertors;power distribution control;transfer functions","BGC;DC microgrids;DC-MG;VSM;bidirectional grid-connected converters;dc bus voltage;dc bus voltage fluctuation;dc output current;small-signal transfer function;virtual inertia control parameters;virtual inertia control strategy;virtual synchronous machines","","","","","","","20161229","July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Efficient Hybrid Grouping Spectrum Assignment to Suppress Spectrum Fragments in Flexible Grid Optical Networks","Y. Qiu; J. Xu","College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Southwest University for Nationalities, Chengdu, China","Journal of Lightwave Technology","20170602","2017","35","14","2823","2832","Flexible grid optical networks (FONs) can accommodate diverse kinds of service connections with higher networking flexibility and spectrum-utilization efficiency by employing a finer resource allocation granularity (known as frequency slot) and a more sophisticated path-routing and resource-allocation algorithm (known as routing and spectrum assignment algorithm), when compared to the traditional wavelength division multiplexing optical networks. However, the continuity and the contiguity constraints in spectrum allocation may possibly introduce spectrum fragments, which cannot be utilized by the subsequent service connections and thus reduce the amount of available resources as well as the networking flexibility in FONs. Therefore, many algorithms have been proposed to decrease the amount of spectrum fragments by re-optimizing the fragmented resources. These algorithms are known as spectrum defragmentation algorithms, which always induce traffic disruption or require extra components. In order to avoid traffic disruption and the requirement of extra components, some grouping RSA algorithms have been proposed to suppress spectrum fragments from their generation by pre-dividing the spectrum resources into several either fixed or variable groups. However, since the spectrum resources in one group can only be assigned to the service connections of one specific kind, the flexibility of these grouping algorithms is always limited by the kinds of service connections. In this paper, we introduce hybrid grouping mechanism into spectrum assignment and propose a hybrid-group-based RSA algorithm, most-used-first hybrid grouping (MUFHG) RSA algorithm, to suppress the spectrum fragments generated in FONs. By employing hybrid grouping mechanism, the proposed MUFHG algorithm sorts the spectrum resources into several flexible groups with specified allocation starting FSs. And each spectrum group can accommodate several kinds of service connections if the bandwidth requirements of - hese service connections have multiple relations, which guarantees that the remained or the released spectrum resources in each group can always be re-used. Therefore, spectrum fragments are only generated in the spectrum bands between two adjacent flexible groups. In this way, the proposed hybrid-group-based algorithm can significantly suppress spectrum fragments from their generation. Besides, the proposed MUFHG algorithm helps improve the blocking performance of the network by employing the most-used-first strategy to maximize the number of less frequently used spectrum resources for subsequent service connections. The simulation results indicate that the proposed MUFHG algorithm gains notable reductions in both spectrum fragments and bandwidth blocking probability with neither traffic disruption nor extra components.","0733-8724;07338724","","10.1109/JLT.2017.2704594","Sichuan Provincial Department of Education Project; Sichuan Provincial Science and Technology Project; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7929255","Flexible grid optical networks;fragment;hybrid-grouping;routing and spectrum assignment","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Frequency selective surfaces;Hybrid power systems;Optical fiber networks;Resource management;Routing","optical fibre networks;resource allocation;telecommunication network routing;wavelength division multiplexing","FON;MUFHG algorithm;adjacent flexible groups;bandwidth blocking probability;blocking performance;contiguity constraints;continuity constraints;extra components;flexible grid optical networks;fragmented resources;frequency slot;hybrid grouping spectrum assignment;hybrid-group-based RSA algorithm;most-used-first hybrid grouping RSA algorithm;networking flexibility;path-routing;resource allocation granularity;resource-allocation algorithm;routing and spectrum assignment algorithm;spectrum allocation;spectrum bands;spectrum defragmentation algorithms;spectrum fragments;spectrum resources;spectrum-utilization efficiency;subsequent service connections;traditional wavelength division multiplexing optical networks;traffic disruption","","","","","","","20170516","July15, 15 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Because microexpressions are fleeting, lasting only a few frames within a video sequence, they are difficult to perceive and interpret correctly, and they are highly challenging to identify and categorize automatically. Existing recognition methods are often ineffective at handling subtle face displacements, which can be prevalent in typical microexpression applications due to the constant movements of the individuals being observed. To address this problem, a novel method called the Facial Dynamics Map is proposed to characterize the movements of a microexpression in different granularity. Specifically, an algorithm based on optical flow estimation is used to perform pixel-level alignment for microexpression sequences. Each expression sequence is then divided into spatiotemporal cuboids in the chosen granularity. We also present an iterative optimal strategy to calculate the principal optical flow direction of each cuboid for better representation of the local facial dynamics. With these principal directions, the resulting Facial Dynamics Map can characterize a microexpression sequence. Finally, a classifier is developed to identify the presence of microexpressions and to categorize different types. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate higher recognition performance and improved interpretability.","1949-3045;19493045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2016.2518162","Ministry of Education of China; 10.13039/100000001 - US National Science Foundation (NSF); 10.13039/100008321 - Pennsylvania State University; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100004543 - China Scholarship Council; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7383236","Microexpression;emotions;expression recognition;face recognition;optical flow","Adaptive optics;Cameras;Face;Frequency division multiplexing;Optical imaging;Strain;Tagging","emotion recognition;face recognition;image sequences","facial dynamics map;iterative optimal strategy;microexpression categorization;microexpression identification;microexpression sequences;optical flow estimation;pixel-level alignment;spatiotemporal cuboids","","","","","","","20170520","April-June 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Despite the significant success, one limitation to most of the existing ensemble clustering methods is that they generally treat all base clusterings equally regardless of their reliability, which makes them vulnerable to low-quality base clusterings. Although some efforts have been made to (globally) evaluate and weight the base clusterings, yet these methods tend to view each base clustering as an individual and neglect the local diversity of clusters inside the same base clustering. It remains an open problem how to evaluate the reliability of clusters and exploit the local diversity in the ensemble to enhance the consensus performance, especially, in the case when there is no access to data features or specific assumptions on data distribution. To address this, in this paper, we propose a novel ensemble clustering approach based on ensemble-driven cluster uncertainty estimation and local weighting strategy. In particular, the uncertainty of each cluster is estimated by considering the cluster labels in the entire ensemble via an entropic criterion. A novel ensemble-driven cluster validity measure is introduced, and a locally weighted co-association matrix is presented to serve as a summary for the ensemble of diverse clusters. With the local diversity in ensembles exploited, two novel consensus functions are further proposed. Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2017.2702343","Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar; NSFC; National Key Research Development Program of China; Ph.D. Start-up Fund of Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7932479","Cluster uncertainty estimation;consensus clustering;ensemble clustering;local weighting","Clustering algorithms;Estimation;Indexes;Partitioning algorithms;Robustness;Uncertainty","","","","","","","","","20170523","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, until now there were no effective algorithms proposed to address incremental SVOR learning due to the complicated formulations of SVOR. Recently, an interesting accurate on-line algorithm was proposed for training ν-support vector classification (ν-SVC), which can handle a quadratic formulation with a pair of equality constraints. In this paper, we first present a modified SVOR formulation based on a sum-of-margins strategy. The formulation has multiple constraints, and each constraint includes a mixture of an equality and an inequality. Then, we extend the accurate on-line ν-SVC algorithm to the modified formulation, and propose an effective incremental SVOR algorithm. The algorithm can handle a quadratic formulation with multiple constraints, where each constraint is constituted of an equality and an inequality. More importantly, it tackles the conflicts between the equality and inequality constraints. We also provide the finite convergence analysis for the algorithm. Numerical experiments on the several benchmark and real-world data sets show that the incremental algorithm can converge to the optimal solution in a finite number of steps, and is faster than the existing batch and incremental SVOR algorithms. Meanwhile, the modified formulation has better accuracy than the existing incremental SVOR algorithm, and is as accurate as the sum-of-margins based formulation of Shashua and Levin.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2342533","Priority Academic Program Development, Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions; 10.13039/100000001 - U.S. National Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6876186","Incremental learning;online learning;ordinal regression (OR);support vector machine (SVM)","Algorithm design and analysis;Convergence;Educational institutions;Support vector machines;Training;Training data;Vectors","convergence;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;regression analysis;support vector machines","ν-SVC;ν-support vector classification;SVOR learning;equality constraints;finite convergence analysis;incremental support vector learning;inequality constraints;on-line algorithm;ordinal regression problems;quadratic formulation;sum-of-margins strategy;support vector ordinal regression","","222","","33","","","20140812","July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Then these two algorithms are equipped with three distinctive techniques: 1) a dynamic cluster sizing strategy; 2) an alternative utilization of Gaussian and Cauchy distributions to generate offspring; and 3) an adaptive local search. The dynamic cluster sizing affords a potential balance between exploration and exploitation and reduces the sensitivity to the cluster size in the niching methods. Taking advantages of Gaussian and Cauchy distributions, we generate the offspring at the niche level through alternatively using these two distributions. Such utilization can also potentially offer a balance between exploration and exploitation. Further, solution accuracy is enhanced through a new local search scheme probabilistically conducted around seeds of niches with probabilities determined self-adaptively according to fitness values of these seeds. Extensive experiments conducted on 20 benchmark multimodal problems confirm that both algorithms can achieve competitive performance compared with several state-of-the-art multimodal algorithms, which is supported by nonparametric tests.

Thus, our aim is to speed up the association rule mining process regardless the algorithm used to this end, enabling the performance of efficient implementations to be enhanced.

For a data center operator, the synchronous EV charging of the employees at the workplace during the working hours would incur an additional large demand charge. To avoid/reduce such demand charge, we investigate a joint energy management problem for geo-distributed data centers and EVs of the employees in this paper. Specifically, we intend to minimize the cost of a data center operator by jointly scheduling data center workload and EV charging under the given power limits, where the cost consists of electricity bill, revenue loss associated with workloads, and battery depreciation cost. We first formulate a total cost minimization problem with the consideration of heterogeneous demands of EVs and the given power limits. Since the formulated problem is a large-scale convex optimization problem with temporally-coupled and spatially-coupled constraints, we propose a distributed algorithm to solve it.

In addition to the features of the public goods game, this model also introduces the factor of individual incentive depending on his degree. We found that the individual strategy to be chosen was not relevant to the user's degree, but to an incentive constant of the entire network. The simulation results showed that individual strategies asymptotically followed three different behaviors according to the dynamic organization of the individuals. Active users will emerge during the evolutionary process with an incentive. Without an incentive, active central users can hardly affect the states of their neighbors and may even become lurkers due to the large number of lurking neighbors. Large noise decreases the influence of the high incentive and causes the chaos of networks.

With the fused information, the consensus-based estimation algorithms are proposed for SNs and RNs, respectively.

First, the proposed method performs color image segmentation by a simplified pulse-coupled neural network (SPCNN) for the object model image and test image, and then conducts a region-based matching between them. Hence, we name it as RBOR with SPCNN (SPCNN-RBOR). Hereinto, the values of SPCNN parameters are automatically set by our previously proposed method in terms of each object model. In order to reduce various light intensity effects and take advantage of SPCNN high resolution on low intensities for achieving optimized color segmentation, a transformation integrating normalized Red Green Blue (RGB) with opponent color spaces is introduced. A novel image segmentation strategy is suggested to group the pixels firing synchronously throughout all the transformed channels of an image. Based on the segmentation results, a series of adaptive thresholds, which is adjustable according to the specific object model is employed to remove outlier region blobs, form potential clusters, and refine the clusters in test images. The proposed SPCNN-RBOR method overcomes the drawback of feature-based methods that inevitably includes background information into local invariant feature descriptors when keypoints locate near object boundaries. A large number of experiments have proved that the proposed SPCNN-RBOR method is robust for diverse complex variations, even under partial occlusion and highly cluttered environments. In addition, the SPCNN-RBOR method works well in not only identifying textured objects, but also in less-textured ones, which significantly outperforms the current feature-based methods.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2351418","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Interdisciplinary Incubation Project of Shaanxi Normal University; Korea Institute of Science and Technology Institutional Program, Seoul, Korea; National Agenda Project through the Korea Research Council of Fundamental Science and Technology; National Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6975153","Feature-based method;image segmentation;object recognition;region-based matching;simplified pulse-coupled neural network (SPCNN);simplified pulse-coupled neural network (SPCNN).","Color;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Neurons;Object recognition;Robustness","image colour analysis;image matching;image segmentation;neural nets;object recognition","SPCNN-RBOR method;adaptive thresholds;color image segmentation;light intensity effects;local invariant feature descriptors;outlier region blob removal;region-based matching;region-based object recognition;simplified PCNN;simplified pulse-coupled neural network","","3","","48","","","20141204","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents a simple effective online algorithm for the charging and discharging decisions of energy storage that minimizes the electricity cost in the presence of electricity price fluctuations and renewable energy supplies, without relying on the future information of prices, demands, or renewable energy supplies. The proposed algorithm is supported by a near-best worst-case guarantee (i.e., competitive ratio), as compared with the offline optimal decisions based on full future information.

Wild human faces vary with the poses, expressions, and illumination changes. All kinds of noises, like block occlusions, random pixel corruptions, and various disguises may also destroy the consistency of faces referring to the same person. This motivates us to develop a robust face clustering algorithm that is less sensitive to these noises. To retain the underlying structured information within facial images, we use tensors to represent faces, and then accomplish the clustering task based on the tensor data. The proposed algorithm is called robust tensor clustering (RTC), which firstly finds a lower-rank approximation of the original tensor data using a L1 norm optimization function. Because L1 norm does not exaggerate the effect of noises compared with L2 norm, the minimization of the L1 norm approximation function makes RTC robust. Then, we compute high-order singular value decomposition of this approximate tensor to obtain the final clustering results. Different from traditional algorithms solving the approximation function with a greedy strategy, we utilize a nongreedy strategy to obtain a better solution. Experiments conducted on the benchmark facial datasets and gait sequences demonstrate that RTC has better performance than the state-of-the-art clustering algorithms and is more robust to noises.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2376938","100 Talents Programme of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Doctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China; National Basic Research Program of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6995956","Disguise;face clustering;nongreedy maximization;occlusion;pixel corruption;tensor clustering","Approximation methods;Clustering algorithms;Face;Noise;Robustness;Tensile stress;Vectors","approximation theory;face recognition;greedy algorithms;optimisation;pattern clustering;singular value decomposition;tensors","L1 norm optimization function;RTC;block occlusions;high-order singular value decomposition;image managements;lower-rank approximation;nongreedy strategy;random pixel corruptions;robust face clustering algorithm;tensor decomposition;video analysis","0;Algorithms;Cluster Analysis;Face;Female;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Male;Pattern Recognition, Automated","5","","47","","","20141223","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Psychoacoustic and physiological studies indicate that the auditory system of mammals decomposes audio signals into their acoustic and modulation frequency components prior to further analysis. Since it is known that most linguistic information is coded in amplitude fluctuations, mimicking temporal processing strategies of the auditory system in automatic speech recognition (ASR) promises to increase recognition accuracies. We present an amplitude modulation filter bank (AMFB) that is used as a feature extraction scheme in ASR systems. The time-frequency resolution of the employed FIR filters, i.e., bandwidth and modulation frequency settings, are adopted from a psychophysically inspired model of Dau (1997) that was originally proposed to describe data from human psychoacoustics. Investigations on modulation phase indicate the need for preserving such information in amplitude modulation features. We show that the filter symmetry has an important impact on ASR performance. The proposed feature extraction scheme exhibits significant word error rate (WER) reductions using the Aurora-2, Aurora-4, and REVERB ASR tasks compared to other recent feature extraction methods, such as MFCC, FDLP, and PNCC features. Thereby, AMFB features reveal high robustness against additive noise, different transmission channel characteristics, and room reverberation. Using the Aurora-4 benchmark, for instance, an average WER of 12.33% with raw and 11.31% with bottleneck transformed features is attained, which constitutes a relative improvement of 19.6% and 29.2% over raw MFCC features, respectively.","2329-9290;23299290","","10.1109/TASLP.2015.2456420","10.13039/501100001659 - DFG; 10.13039/501100002347 and 10.13039/501100000780 - Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the European Commision; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7156117","Amplitude modulation filter bank;bottleneck features;feature extraction;modulation phase","Feature extraction;Filter banks;Finite impulse response filters;Frequency modulation;Noise;Speech","FIR filters;acoustic signal processing;amplitude modulation;channel bank filters;error statistics;feature extraction;reverberation;signal resolution;speech recognition;time-frequency analysis","AMFB;ASR;FIR filter;WER reduction;acoustic frequency components;acoustic sound classification;additive noise;audio signal decomposition;auditory inspired amplitude modulation filter bank;automatic speech recognition;human psychoacoustics;mammal auditory system;mimicking temporal processing strategy;modulation frequency components;robust feature extraction;room reverberation;time-frequency resolution;word error rate reduction","","3","","47","","","20150714","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This is the first attempt to use biclustering algorithm on trading data. The mined patterns are regarded as trading rules and can be classified as three trading actions (i.e., the buy, the sell, and no-action signals) with respect to the maximum support. A modified K nearest neighborhood (K-NN) method is applied to classification of trading days in the testing period. The proposed method [called biclustering algorithm and the K nearest neighbor (BIC-K-NN)] was implemented on four historical datasets and the average performance was compared with the conventional buy-and-hold strategy and three previously reported intelligent trading systems.

Among all existing technologies, the techniques for the fifth generation (5G) systems are the main driving force for the actualization of IoT concept. However, due to the heterogeneous environment in 5G networks and the broadcast nature of radio propagation, the security assurance against eavesdropping is a vital yet challenging task. In this paper, we focus on the transmission design for secure relay communications in IoT networks, where the communication is exposed to eavesdroppers with unknown number and locations. The randomize-and-forward relay strategy specially designed for secure multi-hop communications is employed in our transmission protocol. First, we consider a single-antenna scenario, where all the devices in the network are equipped with the single antenna. We derive the expression for the secrecy outage probability of the two-hop transmission. Following this, a secrecy-rate-maximization problem subject to a secrecy-outage-probability constraint is formulated. The optimal power allocation and codeword rate design are obtained. Furthermore, we generalize the above analyses to a more generic scenario, where the relay and eavesdroppers are equipped with multiple antennas. Numerical results show that the proper use of relay transmission can enhance the secrecy throughput and extend the secure coverage range.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2575863","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7484703","Internet of Things (IoT);physical layer security;relay transmission;resource allocation;stochastic geometry","5G mobile communication;Antenna measurements;Internet of things;Radio propagation;Resource management;Security;Sensors","5G mobile communication;Internet of Things;computer network reliability;computer network security;mobile antennas;probability;relay networks (telecommunication);transport protocols","5G networks;Internet of Things;IoT communication security enhancement;codeword rate design;eavesdropping;fifth generation systems;heterogeneous environment;optimal power allocation;radiopropagation;randomize-and-forward relay strategy;secrecy throughput enhancement;secrecy-outage-probability constraint;secrecy-rate-maximization problem;secure multihop communications;secure relay communications;security assurance;single-antenna scenario;transmission design;transmission protocol;two-hop transmission","","13","","38","","OAPA","20160607","2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Some existing methods for checking the integrity of the data cannot handle this problem efficiently and they cannot deal with the error condition. Thus, a secure and efficient dynamic auditing protocol should reject requests that are made with improper authentication. In addition, an excellent remote data authentication method should be able to collect information for statistical analysis, such as validation results. In this paper, first we design an auditing framework for cloud storage systems and propose an efficient and privacy-preserving auditing protocol. Then, we extend our auditing protocol to support dynamic data operations, which is efficient and has been proven to be secure in the random oracle model. We extended our auditing protocol further to support bidirectional authentication and statistical analysis.

In this paper, a novel SOC feedback strategy in wind power smoothing based on short-term forecast and scenario analysis is proposed. Other than mainly considering the real-time information in existing strategies, the principal idea of the new SOC feedback strategy is to estimate the SOC varying curve of the BESS in the advance control period with the assistance of the forecasted wind power data. Dynamic SOC margins are determined by scenario analysis to handle the uncertainty in wind power forecast. When the BESS suffers from over-charge or over-discharge in the advance control period, the SOC feedback strategy is then triggered to adjust the BESS output at the current control moment. The effectiveness of the new SOC feedback strategy is validated in case study by using historical wind power data of a WF in Gansu province of China.","1949-3029;19493029","","10.1109/TSTE.2016.2625305","10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7736052","Battery energy storage system;scenario analysis;short-term forecast;state of charge feedback strategy;wind power smoothing","Batteries;Indexes;Real-time systems;Smoothing methods;State of charge;Wind forecasting;Wind power generation","battery storage plants;feedback;load forecasting;wind power plants","BESS-integrated WF;China;Gansu province;SOC feedback strategy;SOC varying curve estimation;battery energy storage system-integrated wind farm;current control moment;dynamic SOC margin;scenario analysis;short-term forecast;state of charge feedback strategy;wind power generation variability reduction;wind power smoothing","","","","","","","20161104","April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to detect abnormal nodes, we had better collect sensory data from all nodes. However, this strategy requires much more energy consumption, so we should try to wake up these nodes near the abnormal filed. Based on this observation, we propose a novel energy-efficient method to wake them up. The main idea is to let abnormal nodes send out control packets to activate their one-hop neighbor nodes; then, neighbor nodes continue detecting, and finally, all abnormal nodes send information to the sink node through the shortest paths. Thereafter, we further propose to handle these information in the sink node, including extracting boundary nodes, drawing isolines, and estimating the location of leakage source. To extract boundary nodes, we divide all abnormal nodes into different intervals in an ascending or descending order, and then find two nodes with minimum and maximum in each interval, so these nodes are regarded as boundary nodes. As to the second point, we reuse the wide-adopted interpolation methods to draw isolines, such as cubic, nearest, and invdist. Besides, we use interpolation to find the coordinate of the peak, and then, it is deemed to be the leakage source.

To solve this problem, the joint design of training-based channel estimation and cluster formation are studied in this paper. To provide efficient cooperation strategies in C-RANs, individual C-RAN clusters are formed by the remote radio heads (RRHs), and a data-assisted channel estimation scheme is studied, which can reduce the redundant cost of training sequences. To ensure the performance of channel estimation and data transmissions, the cluster formation and the channel estimation are optimized jointly. In particular, an iterative training-based channel estimation scheme is designed by using convex optimization and the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm jointly. Moreover, a utility function of cluster formation can be established based on the estimates and the mean squared error of our proposed channel estimation algorithm, and the cluster formation of RRHs can be formulated as a coalitional formation game. Furthermore, a sub-optimal algorithm is also proposed to reduce the computational complexity.

However, the dorsal hand vein is usually captured by near-infrared (NIR) sensors and the resulting image is of low contrast and shows a very sparse subcutaneous vascular network. Therefore, it does not offer sufficient distinctiveness in recognition particularly in the presence of large population. This paper proposes a novel approach to hand-dorsa vein recognition through matching local features of multiple sources. In contrast to current studies only concentrating on the hand vein network, we also make use of person dependent optical characteristics of the skin and subcutaneous tissue revealed by NIR hand-dorsa images and encode geometrical attributes of their landscapes, e.g., ridges, valleys, etc., through different quantities, such as cornerness and blobness, closely related to differential geometry. Specifically, the proposed method adopts an effective keypoint detection strategy to localize features on dorsal hand images, where the speciality of absorption and scattering of the entire dorsal hand is modeled as a combination of multiple (first-, second-, and third-) order gradients. These features comprehensively describe the discriminative clues of each dorsal hand. This method further robustly associates the corresponding keypoints between gallery and probe samples, and finally predicts the identity. Evaluated by extensive experiments, the proposed method achieves the best performance so far known on the North China University of Technology (NCUT) Part A dataset, showing its effectiveness. Additional results on NCUT Part B illustrate its generalization ability and robustness to low quality data.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2360894","French Research Agency (Agence Nationale de Recherche, ANR); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Joint Project by the LIA2MCSI Laboratory between the Group of Ecoles Centrales and Beihang University; National Basic Research Program of China; Research Program of State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100005089 - Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6919302","Hand-dorsa vein recognition;multilevel keypoint detection;optical properties of dorsa hand subcutaneous tissue;oriented gradient maps (OGMs)","Biomedical optical imaging;Detectors;Feature extraction;Optical imaging;Optical scattering;Skin;Veins","image matching;vein recognition","Hand-Dorsa vein recognition;NCUT;NIR;North China University of Technology;differential geometry;dorsal hand images;dorsal hand vein;liveness detection;local feature matching;multisource keypoints;near-infrared sensors;optical characteristics;people identification;sparse subcutaneous vascular network","","7","","39","","","20141009","Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This theory provides a Dempster's rule of combination to synthesize multiple evidences from various information sources. However, in some cases, counter-intuitive results may be obtained based on that combination rule. Numerous new or improved methods have been proposed to suppress these counter-intuitive results based on perspectives, such as minimizing the information loss or deviation. Inspired by evolutionary game theory, this paper considers a biological and evolutionary perspective to study the combination of evidences. An evolutionary combination rule (ECR) is proposed to help find the most biologically supported proposition in a multievidence system. Within the proposed ECR, we develop a Jaccard matrix game to formalize the interaction between propositions in evidences, and utilize the replicator dynamics to mimick the evolution of propositions. Experimental results show that the proposed ECR can effectively suppress the counter-intuitive behaviors appeared in typical paradoxes of evidence theory, compared with many existing methods. Properties of the ECR, such as solution's stability and convergence, have been mathematically proved as well.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2015.2462352","National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Programs); National Key Technology R&D Program China; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; State Key Program for Basic Research of China (973 Programs); 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002358 - open funding project of the State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems, Beihang University; 10.13039/501100004543 - China Scholarship Council; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194765","Belief function;Dempster–Shafer evidence theory;evolutionary game theory (EGT);evolutionary stable strategy (ESS);multisource information fusion;replicator equation (RE)","Evolution (biology);Game theory;Games;Sociology;Stability analysis;Statistics","evolutionary computation;game theory;inference mechanisms;matrix algebra","Dempster combination rule;Dempster-Shafer evidence theory;ECR;Jaccard matrix game;biological perspective;biologically supported proposition;counter-intuitive behaviors;counter-intuitive results;evidence combination;evolutionary combination rule;evolutionary game theory;evolutionary perspective;multievidence system;multisource information fusion;paradoxes;replicator dynamics;uncertain information","","8","","","","","20150813","Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Using “SCmules” such as taxis, to opportunistically communicate with intelligent devices and collect data from the sparse networks formed by them in the process of moving is an economical and effective way to achieve this goal. In this paper, the social welfare data collection paradigm SWDCP-SCmules data collection framework is proposed to collect data generated by intelligent devices and forward them to data centers, in which “SCmules” are data transmitters picking up data from nearby intelligent devices and then store-carry-forwarding them to nearby data centers via short-range wireless connections in the process of moving. Because of the storage limitations, “SCmules” need to weigh the value of data and select some less valuable data to discard when necessary. To quantify the value of data and find a well-performed selection strategy, the concept of priority is introduced to the SWDCP-SCmules scheme, and then, the simulated annealing for priority assignment SA-PA algorithm is proposed to guide the priority assignment. The SA-PA algorithm is a universal algorithm that can improve the performance of SWDCP-SCmules scheme by finding better priority assignment with respect to various optimization targets, such as maximizing collection rate or minimizing redundancy rate, in which priority assignment problem is converted into an optimization problem and simulated annealing is used to optimize the priority assignment. From the perspective of machine learning, the process of optimization is equal to automatically learn social-aware patterns from past GPS trajectory data. Experiments based on real GPS trajectory data of taxis in- Beijing are conducted to show the effectiveness and efficiency of SWDCP-SCmules scheme and SA-PA algorithm.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2611863","GDUPS (2015); National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); National Key Technology R&D Program of China; S &T Projects of Guangdong Province; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7572984","Vehicular mobile networks;data collection;machine learning;oblivious data mules;opportunistic communication;simulated annealing;social welfare","Data collection;Global Positioning System;Optimization;Public transportation;Smart cities;Trajectory;Transmitters","computer centres;mobile radio;simulated annealing","GPS trajectory;SA-PA algorithm;SWDCP-SCmules;data centers;intelligent devices;intelligent management;opportunistic communication;simulated annealing;smart city;social-aware data collection scheme;store-carry-forwarding;vehicular mobile networks","","8","","","","OAPA","20160921","2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Population diversity maintenance is crucial for preventing particles from being stuck into local optima. In this paper, we present an improved PSO algorithm with an interswarm interactive learning strategy (IILPSO) by overcoming the drawbacks of the canonical PSO algorithm's learning strategy. IILPSO is inspired by the phenomenon in human society that the interactive learning behavior takes place among different groups. Particles in IILPSO are divided into two swarms. The interswarm interactive learning (IIL) behavior is triggered when the best particle's fitness value of both the swarms does not improve for a certain number of iterations. According to the best particle's fitness value of each swarm, the softmax method and roulette method are used to determine the roles of the two swarms as the learning swarm and the learned swarm. In addition, the velocity mutation operator and global best vibration strategy are used to improve the algorithm's global search capability. The IIL strategy is applied to PSO with global star and local ring structures, which are termed as IILPSO-G and IILPSO-L algorithm, respectively. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare the proposed algorithms with eight popular PSO variants. From the experimental results, IILPSO demonstrates the good performance in terms of solution accuracy, convergence speed, and reliability. Finally, the variations of the population diversity in the entire search process provide an explanation why IILPSO performs effectively.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2015.2474153","Foundation for Distinguished Young Talents in Higher Education of Guangdong, China; MOE Youth Foundation Project of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities in China; National Science Foundation of SZU; Ningbo Science and Technology Bureau under Science and Technology Project; PAPD and CICAEET project; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7247710","Global optimization;interswarm interactive learning (IIL) strategy;particle swarm optimization (PSO);population diversity","Algorithm design and analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Optimization;Particle swarm optimization;Sociology;Statistics;Structural rings","learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;search problems;swarm intelligence","IILPSO;IILPSO-G;IILPSO-L;global best vibration strategy;global search capability;interswarm interactive learning strategy;particle swarm optimization;population diversity maintenance;roulette method;search process;softmax method;velocity mutation operator","","1","","","","","20150909","Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This dynamic annotation procedure fits the active learning perspective and accompanies the imbalanced multiple noisy labeling problem. This paper proposes a novel active learning framework with multiple imperfect annotators involved in crowdsourcing systems. The framework contains two core procedures: label integration and instance selection. In the label integration procedure, a positive label threshold (PLAT) algorithm is introduced to induce the class membership from the multiple noisy label set of each instance in a training set. PLAT solves the imbalanced labeling problem by dynamically adjusting the threshold for determining the class membership of an example. Furthermore, three novel instance selection strategies are proposed to adapt PLAT for improving the learning performance. These strategies are respectively based on the uncertainty derived from the multiple labels, the uncertainty derived from the learned model, and the combination method (CFI). Experimental results on 12 datasets with different underlying class distributions demonstrate that the three novel instance selection strategies significantly improve the learning performance, and CFI has the best performance when labeling behaviors exhibit different levels of imbalance in crowdsourcing systems.

Existing graph-based propagation algorithms usually treat unlabeled examples equally, and transmit seed labels to the unlabeled examples that are connected to the labeled examples in a neighborhood graph. However, such a popular propagation scheme is very likely to yield inaccurate propagation, because it falls short of tackling ambiguous but critical data points (e.g., outliers). To this end, this paper treats the unlabeled examples in different levels of difficulties by assessing their reliability and discriminability, and explicitly optimizes the propagation quality by manipulating the propagation sequence to move from simple to difficult examples. In particular, we propose a novel iterative label propagation algorithm in which each propagation alternates between two paradigms, teaching-to-learn and learning-to-teach (TLLT). In the teaching-to-learn step, the learner conducts the propagation on the simplest unlabeled examples designated by the teacher. In the learning-to-teach step, the teacher incorporates the learner's feedback to adjust the choice of the subsequent simplest examples. The proposed TLLT strategy critically improves the accuracy of label propagation, making our algorithm substantially robust to the values of tuning parameters, such as the Gaussian kernel width used in graph construction. The merits of our algorithm are theoretically justified and empirically demonstrated through experiments performed on both synthetic and real-world data sets.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2514360","973 plan of China; 10.13039/501100000923 - Australian Research Council; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7447818","Label propagation;machine teaching;semisupervised learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Education;Entropy;Gaussian processes;Laplace equations;Learning systems;Reliability","graph theory;learning by example","Gaussian kernel width;TLLT;graph construction;graph-based propagation algorithms;iterative label propagation algorithm;label information propagation;learner feedback;learning-to-teach;neighborhood graph;propagation quality;propagation sequence;teaching-to-learn;unlabeled examples","","1","","","","","20160405","June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this study, we focus on the task of early detection of anastomosis leakage (AL), a severe complication after elective surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery, using free text extracted from EHRs. We use a bag-of-words model to investigate the potential for feature selection strategies. The purpose is earlier detection of AL and prediction of AL with data generated in the EHR before the actual complication occur. Due to the high dimensionality of the data, we derive feature selection strategies using the robust support vector machine linear maximum margin classifier, by investigating: 1) a simple statistical criterion (leave-one-out-based test); 2) an intensive-computation statistical criterion (Bootstrap resampling); and 3) an advanced statistical criterion (kernel entropy). Results reveal a discriminatory power for early detection of complications after CRC (sensitivity 100%; specificity 72%).

Traditionally, the redundant energy will be wasted if it cannot be consumed by power load. In fact, the redundant energy can be stored to supply power loads in the future. For this end, we investigate cooperative energy transportation and storage for IoEs in terms of problem analysis, algorithm design, and platform development. After demonstrating the feasibility condition and proving the NP-hard of our problem, we derive the optimal solution by the reduction from a classic knapsack problem. We also design novel heuristics followed by different energy storage strategies.

As for the selection of training samples, our proposed method uses two groups of thresholds instead of just one threshold to enhance the quality of the selected training samples by allowing for their selection in an intelligent manner. In order to achieve high CD accuracy, spatial information such as texture and morphological profiles are utilized in conjunction with spectral information. Our multiple classifier system (MCS) exploits the extreme learning machine (ELM), multinomial logistic regression (MLR), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers.

Previous studies have shown that compared with non-adaptive strategies, this content adaptive strategy achieves stronger security against existing steganalysis. Based on the experiments and analyses, however, we found that this embedding property would inevitably lead to a large limitation in existing adaptive steganography. That is, it is possible for steganalyzers to estimate the regions that have probably been modified after data hiding. In this paper, we propose an adaptive steganalytic scheme based on embedding probabilities of pixels. The main idea of our scheme is that we assign different weights to different pixels in feature extraction. For those pixels with high embedding probabilities, their corresponding weights are larger, since they should contribute more to steganalysis and vice versa. By doing so, we can concentrate our attention on the regions that have probably been modified and significantly reduce the impact of other unchanged smooth regions. It is expected that our proposed method is an improvement on the existing steganalytic methods, which usually assume every pixel has the same contribution to steganalysis. The extensive experiments evaluated on four typical adaptive steganographic methods have shown the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, especially for low embedding rates, for example, lower than 0.20 bpp.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2507159","Fok Ying Tung Education Foundation; Shenzhen Research and Development Program; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7350138","Adaptive Steganalysis;Adaptive Steganography;Adaptive steganography;Embedding Probabilities;Re-Embedding;adaptive steganalysis;embedding probabilities;re-embedding","Adaptation models;Correlation;Distortion;Feature extraction;Image edge detection;Security;Sun","image coding;probability;steganography","adaptive steganalytic scheme;image steganography;pixel embedding probability","","","","29","","","20151209","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The idea behind uniform embedding is that, by uniformly spreading the embedding modifications to the quantized discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients of all possible magnitudes, the average changes of the first-order and the second-order statistics can be possibly minimized, which leads to less statistical detectability. The purpose of this paper is to refine the uniform embedding by considering the relative changes of statistical model for digital images, aiming to make the embedding modifications to be proportional to the coefficient of variation. Such a new strategy can be regarded as generalized uniform embedding in substantial sense. Compared with the original uniform embedding distortion (UED), the proposed method uses all the DCT coefficients (including the DC, zero, and non-zero AC coefficients) as the cover elements. We call the corresponding distortion function uniform embedding revisited distortion (UERD), which incorporates the complexities of both the DCT block and the DCT mode of each DCT coefficient (i.e., selection channel), and can be directly derived from the DCT domain. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified with the evidence obtained from the exhaustive experiments using a popular steganalyzer with rich models on the BOSSbase database. The proposed UERD gains a significant performance improvement in terms of secure embedding capacity when compared with the original UED, and rivals the current state-of-the-art with much reduced computational complexity.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2473815","Key Program through the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong; National Research Foundation for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225122","JPEG Steganography;JPEG steganography;distortion function design;minimal-distortion embedding;uniform embedding","Complexity theory;Databases;Discrete cosine transforms;Distortion;Security;Sun;Transform coding","discrete cosine transforms;image processing;statistical analysis;steganography","BOSSbase database;DCT coefficients;UED;UERD;first-order statistics;nonside-informed JPEG steganography;quantized discrete cosine transform coefficients;second-order statistics;statistical image model;uniform embedding distortion;uniform embedding revisited distortion","","2","","20","","","20150826","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It is a scalp potential of visual motion response, and typically composed of three components: P1, N2, and P2. Usually several repetitions are needed to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of mVEP, but more repetitions will cost more time thus lower the efficiency. Considering the fluctuation of subject's state across time, the adaptive repetitions based on the subject's real-time signal quality is important for increasing the communication efficiency of mVEP-based BCI. In this paper, the amplitudes of the three components of mVEP are proposed to build a dynamic stopping criteria according to the practical information transfer rate (PITR) from the training data. During online test, the repeated stimulus stopped once the predefined threshold was exceeded by the real-time signals and then another circle of stimulus newly began. Evaluation tests showed that the proposed dynamic stopping strategy could significantly improve the communication efficiency of mVEP-based BCI that the average PITR increases from 14.5 bit/min of the traditional fixed repetition method to 20.8 bit/min.

Soft computing can be used as an alternative to the analytical approach, as it offers advantages such as no required knowledge of internal system parameters, compact solutions for multivariable problems, and fast calculation. Because precipitation prediction is a crucial problem, a process which simulates precipitation with two soft-computing techniques was constructed and presented in this paper, namely, adaptive neurofuzzy inference (ANFIS) and support vector regression (SVR). In the current study, polynomial, linear, and radial basis function (RBF) are applied as the kernel function of the SVR to estimate the probability of precipitation.

In this paper, a theoretical and experimental MAS is presented to test new strategies for managing handling operations supported by radio-frequency identification information feedback. Based on this new visibility framework, these strategies applied to scheduling control have been structured on a new distributed organization model to enforce the idea of the division between physical elements and information and communication technologies. This division into two platforms simplifies the design and development of the MAS, providing a higher level of abstraction and preserving the independence between platforms. The proposed MAS, called MAS-DUO, has been validated using a test bench simulator and at the Ciudad Real Central Airport in Spain.","1932-8184;19328184","","10.1109/JSYST.2013.2272248","Junta de Comunidades de Castilla-La Mancha; Ministry of Science and Education of Spain; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6575111","Autonomous agents;decision support systems;multiagent systems (MASs);radio-frequency identification (RFID)","Airports;Autonomous agents;Decision support systems;Multi-agent systems;Radiofrequency identification;Scheduling","airports;control engineering computing;distributed control;manufacturing processes;multi-agent systems;production engineering computing;radiofrequency identification;scheduling","Ciudad Real Central Airport;ICT;MAS models;RFID;agent-based distributed control;airport ground handling operations;complex resource scheduling improvement;computer science;distributed decision making;distributed organization model;information and communication technologies;manufacturing concepts;multiagent systems;physical elements;process engineering;radiofrequency identification information feedback;scheduling control;test bench simulator;visibility framework","","0","","58","","","20130806","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It is currently known that any test pixels in hyperspectral images can be represented within a spectral dictionary using appropriate sparse coefficients. Based on this assumption, some sparsity-based algorithms are developed for hyperspectral detection. This kind of sparse learning method attempts to find the sparse representation from a spectral library, i.e., a dictionary data set from which useful information is extracted. Among these algorithms, the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) strategy is believed to be a simple and useful tool for sparse representation. However, when dealing with the hyperspectral data, the dictionary for sparse learning is usually high-dimensional which dramatically increases the scale and complexity of sparse learning. In such cases, most sparsitybased algorithms including the IRLS strategy lost their efficacy. To deal with this situation, we propose a discriminative IRLS algorithm, called inner-product-based discriminative IRLS detector (IDIRLSD), which decreases the scale and complexity problem by discriminatively seeking a subdictionary that retains the most critical information. Also, IDIRLSD applies a convex minimization for approximately solving the sparse recovery problem. A weighted l<sub>1</sub> minimization is relaxed and solved by IRLS strategy. The proposed algorithm applies an inner-product-based function for constructing the small-scale weighted l<sub>1</sub> minimization with respect to the subdictionary. The solution provided by IDIRLSD is then applied to label the test pixel as target or background. Experimental results from both synthetic and real hyperspectral data demonstrate the improved efficacy of the proposed algorithm.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2329483","973 Program; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; New Century Excellent Talents in the University of Ministry of Education of China; State Key Laboratory of Virtual Reality Technology and Systems; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002358 - Beihang University; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6840998","Hyperspectral target detection;iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS);sparsity-based algorithm;subdictionary construction;weighted ${\ell_1}$ minimization","Dictionaries;Hyperspectral imaging;Minimization;Object detection;Sparse matrices;Vectors","geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;image representation;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation;object detection;remote sensing","automatic target detection;convex minimization;hyperspectral image processing;inner-product-based discriminative IRLS algorithm;iteratively reweighted least squares strategy;sparse hyperspectral detection;sparse learning method;sparse representation;sparsity-based algorithms","","1","","26","","","20140620","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, conventional 3-D imaging lidar has a long data acquisition time. This paper introduces a spatially adaptive method to obtain target profile rapidly for 3-D imaging lidar by exploiting discontinuities between targets and background in the depth domain. The idea behind our strategy is using an adaptive scanning step to localize the regions near the depth boundaries and perform fine scans only to these regions. Fine scans only for those specific regions ensure the recovery accuracy while consuming much less data acquisition time, compared to a conventional high-resolution scanning lidar. Experimental results demonstrate that for the experimental scene, the data acquisition time decreases 85% by using the proposed method, without generating much distortion of the target profile. This method may be of considerable value to fields that need fast 3-D imaging, such as remote sensing and military reconnaissance.","1943-0655;19430655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2016.2625801","Fund Project for Low-Light-Level Night Vision Laboratory; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Innovation Fund Project for Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Systems for High-Dimensional Information of Ministry of Education; Six-Talent Peak Project of Jiangsu Province; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7737022","3-D imaging;3-D reconstruction;Lidar;photon counting;time-of-flight imaging","Data acquisition;Detectors;Image reconstruction;Imaging;Laser radar;Photonics;Three-dimensional displays","avalanche photodiodes;image reconstruction;integrated optics;integrated optoelectronics;optical radar;photon counting;remote sensing by laser beam","Geiger mode avalanche photodiodes;adaptive target profile acquiring method;data acquisition time;depth image;direct detection 3D imaging lidar;military reconnaissance;noncooperative targets;photon counting 3D imaging lidar;remote sensing;spatially adaptive method;time-correlated single-photon counting","","","","","","OAPA","20161107","Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to solve the unmixing problem using a collection of previously available spectral signatures (i.e., a spectral library), sparse unmixing aims at finding the optimal subset of endmembers to represent the pixels in a hyperspectral image. The classic collaborative unmixing globally assumes that all pixels in a hyperspectral scene share the same active set of endmembers. This assumption rarely holds in practice, as endmembers tend to appear localized in spatially homogeneous areas rather than spread over the whole image. To address this limitation, in this letter, we introduce a new strategy to preserve local collaborativity for sparse hyperspectral unmixing. The proposed approach, which is called local collaborative sparse unmixing, considers the fact that endmember signatures generally appear distributed in local spatial regions instead of uniformly distributed throughout the scene. The proposed approach, which includes spatial information in the standard collaborative formulation, has been experimentally validated using both simulated and real hyperspectral data sets.","1545-598X;1545598X","","10.1109/LGRS.2016.2527782","Jiangxi Science and Technology Research Project of Education Department of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7433396","Hyperspectral imaging;local collaborative sparse regression;sparse unmixing;spectral unmixing","Collaboration;Hyperspectral imaging;Image color analysis;Libraries;Mixture models;Optimization","hyperspectral imaging;image processing;remote sensing","hyperspectral data exploitation;hyperspectral image;local collaborative sparse regression;sparse hyperspectral unmixing;sparse unmixing;spectral signature","","","","27","","","20160314","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A reflection mechanism is used to abstract the resource scheduling process as a metaobject. Petri nets are used to construct the base layer model, meta layer model, metaobject protocol, and other components, thus forming the resource scheduling model. The adaptive resource scheduling strategy is converted into CTL formulas, and the properties are analyzed. Meanwhile, an enforcement algorithm is proposed, which can guarantee the correct behavior of cloud computing while meeting the required reliability within deadline constraints. The operational semantics and related theories of Petri nets help prove its effectiveness and correctness. We have also performed a series of simulations to evaluate our approach.

In nature, good parents are more likely to produce good offspring, because genes from good individuals propagate throughout the population. Inspired by this phenomenon, a two-step subpopulation strategy is proposed, in which individuals in the current population are sorted based on evaluation metrics, and are divided into superior and inferior subpopulations. The inferior subpopulation evolves to generate offspring. If the generated offspring has better evaluation metric values than individuals in the superior subpopulation, they will replace the latter and be used as vectors for mutation strategies. The proposed strategy is incorporated into several advanced DE variants for both single-objective optimization (SOP) and MOPs to verify its effectiveness. Experiments are conducted on 25 single objective, 5 bi-objective, and 4 tri-objective Deb, Thiele, Laumanns and Zitzler (DTLZ) benchmark problems. Results indicate that the proposed subpopulation strategy is capable of improving the performance of both single objective and multiobjective algorithms. The application of the proposed approach is demonstrated by solving a microwave circuit design problem with stringent requirements.

Some researchers have realized that it is necessary to integrate different forensic approaches in order to obtain better localization performance. However, several important issues have not been comprehensively studied, for example, how to select and improve/readjust proper forensic approaches, and how to fuse the detection results of different forensic approaches to obtain good localization results. In this paper, we propose a framework to improve the performance of forgery localization via integrating tampering possibility maps. In the proposed framework, we first select and improve two existing forensic approaches, i.e., statistical feature-based detector and copy-move forgery detector, and then adjust their results to obtain tampering possibility maps. After investigating the properties of possibility maps and comparing various fusion schemes, we finally propose a simple yet very effective strategy to integrate the tampering possibility maps to obtain the final localization results.

In this paper, we generalize this sign-flipping technique by randomly embedding sign-flips into all stages of the DCTs butterfly structure so that the encryption space becomes much larger to yield a higher security. We pursue this study for H.264-compatible videos, assuming that the integer DCT of size 4 × 4 is used.

Second, we convert the 4 × 4 2-D DCT into a 16-point 1-D butterfly structure so that more sign-flips can be embedded at its various stages. Third, we choose different schemes to pair the node-variables in the 16-point 1-D butterfly structure, thus further enlarging the encryption space.

In this paper, a practical optical cryptanalysis method using wavefront shaping is proposed. Considering that the confusion and diffusion of information in the optical cryptosystem are actually caused by scattering effect of random phase mask(s), the proposed method employs a point source function and the feedback-based optimization algorithm, which can obtain an equivalent key of the optical cryptosystem. In such a way, the confusion and diffusion of the random phase mask(s) in the cryptosystem could be removed successfully. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the attack strategy from the perspective of wavefront shaping can be seen, and one of the biggest advantages is that it could get an equivalent key of the cryptosystem without deducing its original keys.","1943-0655;19430655","","10.1109/JPHOT.2017.2661809","Natural Science Foundation of SZU; Science and Technology Innovation Commission of Shenzhen; Sino-German Center for Research Promotion; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837597","Focusing;information security;optical feedback;scattering.","Adaptive optics;Encryption;Optical feedback;Optical imaging;Optical scattering","cryptography;masks;optical information processing","cryptosystems;information security;optical cryptanalysis;optimization;random phase mask;wavefront shaping","","1","","","","OAPA","20170131","Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

DFA uses pairs of fault-free and faulty ciphertexts to recover the secret key. DFIA, on the other hand, combines principles of side-channel analysis and fault attacks to try and extract the key using faulty ciphertexts only. Till date, no effective countermeasure that can thwart both DFA- as well as DFIA-based attacks has been reported in the literature to the best of our knowledge. In particular, traditional redundancy-based countermeasures that assume uniform fault distributions are found to be vulnerable against the DFIA due to its use of biased fault models. In this paper, we propose a novel generic countermeasure strategy that combines the principles of redundancy with that of fault space transformation to achieve security against both DFA- and DFIA-based attacks on AES-like block ciphers. As a case study, we have applied our proposed technique to obtain temporal and spatial redundancy-based countermeasures for AES-128, and have evaluated their security against both DFA and DFIA via practical experiments on a SASEBO-GII board. Results show that our proposed countermeasure makes it practically infeasible to obtain a single instance of successful fault injection, even in the presence of biased fault models.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2016.2646638","Directorate of Science and Technology, Government of India; Information Security and Education Awareness (ISEA) Project; Institute Seed Grant (NGI); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7801856","Security;biased faults;block ciphers;countermeasure;fault attacks;fault space transformation;redundancy","Ciphers;Circuit faults;Encryption;Probability distribution;Redundancy","cryptography","AES-128;AES-like block ciphers;DFIA-based attacks;SASEBO-GII board;biased fault models;counter differential fault analysis;cryptosystems;differential fault intensity analysis;fault space transformation;fault-free ciphertexts;faulty ciphertexts;generic approach;secret key;side-channel analysis;spatial redundancy-based countermeasures;temporal redundancy-based countermeasures","","","","","","","20161229","May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A fault in a bus line of CAN will induce a data error which will result in data dropout or time delay, and subsequently may lead to performance degradation or system instability. A strategy to handle fault occurrence in CAN bus is proposed to properly analyze the effect of the fault to CAN-based NCS performance. The fault occurrences are modeled based on fault interarrival time, fault bursts' duration, and Poisson law. Using fault and messages' attributes, response time analysis (RTA) is performed and the probability of control message missing its deadline is calculated. Utilizing the new error handling algorithm to replace the native error handling of CAN, the probability of a control message missing its deadline can be translated into the probability of data dropout for control message. This methodology is evaluated using steer-by-wire system of vehicle to analyze the effect of fault occurrences in CAN. It is found that the proposed error handling mechanism has resulted in better NCS performance and the range of data dropout probability for control message also could be obtained, which serves as crucial input for NCS controller design.","1551-3203;15513203","","10.1109/TII.2016.2543232","10.13039/501100003093 - Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) Malaysia; 10.13039/501100004768 - Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM); 10.13039/501100005417 - Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7435293","Controller area network;Controller area network (CAN);Data error handling;Fault model;Networked control system;Probabilistic schedulability analysis;Steer-by-wire system;data error handling;fault model;networked control system (NCS);probabilistic schedulability analysis;steer-by-wire (SbW) system","Control systems;Electromagnetic interference;Informatics;Probabilistic logic;Protocols;Time factors;Vehicles","control system CAD;controller area networks;delays;error handling;fault tolerant control;networked control systems;probability","CAN-based NCS performance;CAN-based networked control system;CAN-based steer-by-wire system;NCS controller design;Poisson law;RTA;bus line;control message;controller area network;data dropout probability;data error;error handling algorithm;fault attributes;fault burst duration;fault handling;fault interarrival time;fault occurrence modelling;fault occurrences;message attributes;performance degradation;probabilistic analysis;response time analysis;system instability;time delay;vehicle steer-by-wire system","","","","50","","","20160317","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we study secure transmissions under slow fading channels with multipath propagation in millimeter wave systems. Concerning the new propagation characteristics of millimeter wave, we investigate three transmission schemes, namely, maximum ratio transmitting (MRT) beamforming, artificial noise (AN) beamforming, and partial MRT (PMRT) beamforming. We evaluate the secrecy performance by analyzing both the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and the secrecy throughput for each scheme. Particularly, for the AN scheme, we derive a closed-form expression for the optimal power allocation ratio of the information signal power to the total transmit power that minimizes the SOP, as well as obtain an explicit solution on the optimal transmission parameters that maximize the secrecy throughput. By comparing the secrecy performances achieved by different strategies, we demonstrate that the secrecy performance of the millimeter wave system is significantly influenced by the relationship between the legitimate user's and the eavesdropper's spatially resolvable paths, which is different from the wireless systems with statistically independent channel models. In the absence of the common path between the legitimate user and the eavesdropper, MRT beamforming is the best scheme. In the presence of common paths, AN beamforming and PMRT beamforming show their respective superiorities depending on the transmit power and the number of common paths.

These NVM technologies have attractive features, such as low latency and high throughput to satisfy application performance. Accordingly, fast storage devices based on fast NVM lead to a rapid increase in the demand for diverse computer systems and environments (e.g., cloud platforms, web servers, and database systems) where they are expected to be used as primary storage. Despite the promised benefits provided by fast storage devices, modern file systems do not take advantage of the storage's full performance. In this article, we analyze and explore existing I/O strategies in read, write, journal I/ O, and recovery paths between the file system and the storage device. The analysis shows that existing I/O strategies are an obstacle to get maximum performance of fast storage devices. To address this issue, we propose efficient I/O strategies that enable file systems to fully exploit the performance of fast storage devices. Our main idea is to transfer requests from discontiguous host memory buffers in the file systems to discontiguous storage segments in one I/O request to get maximize I/O performance. We implemented our scheme to read, write, journal I/O and recovery operations in the EXT4 file system and the JBD2 module. We demonstrate the implication of our idea in terms of application performance through well-known benchmarks. The experimental results show that our optimized file system achieves better performance than the existing file system, with improvements of up to 1.54 ×, 1.96×, and 2.28× on ordered mode, data journaling mode, and recovery, respectively.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2016.2635644","Basic Science Research Program; Next-Generation Information Computing Development Program; 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; 10.13039/501100003621 - Korea government(MSIP); 10.13039/501100003621 - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning; 10.13039/501100003725 - NRF; 10.13039/501100003725 - National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); 10.13039/501100003725 - National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7769226","File system;I/O stack;journaling;non-volatile memory","Computers;Linux;Memory management;Nonvolatile memory;Optimization;Performance evaluation;Software","MRAM devices;buffer storage","EXT4 file system;I/O performance;I/O request;JBD2 module;computer systems;data journaling mode;discontiguous host memory buffers;discontiguous storage segments;fast NVM technologies;fast nonvolatile memory technologies;fast storage devices;journal I/O operations;journal recovery operations;legacy storage systems","","","","","","","20161205","June 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In general, this kind of process is hardly controlled by using traditional control techniques such as the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. To resolve this problem, a novel PID control scheme is proposed by integrating a data-driven compensation of unmodeled dynamics and a multistep ahead of optimal control strategy. Essential difference from the classical PID controller lies in the use of unmodeled dynamics, the measured data from the pulp neutralization process is used directly for building the nonlinear PID controller, which plays an important role in control system design. Based on multistep ahead prediction optimal control theory, the controller parameters can be obtained through optimizing a cost function. Some theoretical results on the stability and convergence of the closed-loop system are established. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control techniques, a simulation model and a cobalt nickel hydroxide pulp neutralization process are employed. Simulations were carried out using data extracted from an actual pulp neutralization process, followed by some industrial experiments. Results from both simulations and experiments indicate that our proposed controller can effectively control the pH value of the pulp neutralization process with promising control performance.","1063-6536;10636536","","10.1109/TCST.2017.2695981","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of Ministry of Education; Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province; Nature Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7920302","Compensation of unmodeled dynamics;data-driven;proportional-integral-derivative (PID);pulp neutralization process.","Closed loop systems;Cobalt;Leaching;Nickel;PD control;Process control;Stability analysis","","","","","","","","","20170505","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Digital signature is a widely used technique to protect messages' authenticity and nodes' identities. From the practical perspective, to ensure the quality of services in wireless mobile networks, ideally the process of signature verification should introduce minimum delay. Batch cryptography technique is a powerful tool to reduce verification time. However, most of the existing works focus on designing batch verification algorithms for wireless mobile networks without sufficiently considering the impact of invalid signatures, which can lead to verification failures and performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a Batch Identification Game Model (BIGM) in wireless mobile networks, enabling nodes to find invalid signatures with reasonable delay no matter whether the game scenario is complete information or incomplete information. Specifically, we analyze and prove the existence of Nash Equilibriums (NEs) in both scenarios, to select the dominant algorithm for identifying invalid signatures. To optimize the identification algorithm selection, we propose a self-adaptive auto-match protocol which estimates the strategies and states of attackers based on historical information. Comprehensive simulation results in terms of NE reasonability, algorithm selection accuracy, and identification delay are provided to demonstrate that BIGM can identify invalid signatures more efficiently than existing algorithms.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2016.2604820","Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University, Riyadh; Key Laboratory of Aerospace Information Security and Trusted Computing; Major State Basic Research Development Program of China; National High Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China; 10.13039/100000001 - US National Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7556995","Batch identification;game theory;wireless mobile networks","Algorithm design and analysis;Communication system security;Delays;Games;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Wireless communication","cryptography;digital signatures;game theory;mobile radio;quality of service;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","BIGM;NE reasonability;Nash equilibriums;algorithm selection accuracy;batch cryptography technique;batch identification game model;batch verification algorithm;digital signature;identification algorithm selection;identification delay;message authenticity protection;node identity;quality of services;self-adaptive auto-match protocol;signature verification;wireless mobile networks","","1","","","","","20160831","June 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

First, we define decolorization proximity to measure the similarity of adjacent frames. Second, we propose three decolorization strategies for frames with low, medium, and high proximities, to preserve the quality of these three types of frames. Third, we propose a novel decolorization Gaussian mixture model to classify the frames and assign appropriate decolorization strategies to them based on their decolorization proximity.

This is intended to alleviate a perceived lack of access for students to commercialize their ideas. Undergraduate and graduate students are often left with unfinished class projects that do not turn into prototypes or products. Here we aim to avoid this outcome (often referred to as the “Valley of Death”). We recruited students with ideas for products as well as students with varied expertise. We have then formalized their engagement by offering a seminar class that met once every other week over a 15 week semester. After the class each team underwent a one-week intensive boot camp for a final demonstration and presentation of their product and business plan. Throughout the semester the teams solicited and received micro-grants, then used the financial support to acquire materials to prototype several iterations of their ideas. In this paper we present data from our preliminary analysis of two successful teams. Out of five teams who took the class, three completed, and two continued with their products beyond the class. We also discuss strategies to engage students, to form viable teams, to provide technical support, and to deliver content in a non-traditional environment, with students from different backgrounds (e.g., sociology, civil engineering, computer science) enrolled both in undergraduate and graduate programs.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5379-7; POD:978-1-5090-5380-3","10.1109/ISECon.2017.7910251","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7910251","Valley of Death;business plan;entrepreneurship;innovation;makers;multidisciplinary;prototype","Commercialization;Entrepreneurship;Prototypes;Seminars;Springs;Technological innovation","commerce;further education","George Mason University;business plan;design cycle development;entrepreneurship;idea generation;undergraduate programs","","","","","","","","11-11 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The way to measure the relatedness between tasks is always a popular issue. There are mainly two ways to measure relatedness between tasks: common parameters sharing and common features sharing across different tasks. However, these two types of relatedness are mainly learned independently, leading to a loss of information. In this paper, we propose a new strategy to measure the relatedness that jointly learns shared parameters and shared feature representations. The objective of our proposed method is to transform the features of different tasks into a common feature space in which the tasks are closely related and the shared parameters can be better optimized. We give a detailed introduction to our proposed MTL method. Additionally, an alternating algorithm is introduced to optimize the nonconvex objection. A theoretical bound is given to demonstrate that the relatedness between tasks can be better measured by our proposed MTL algorithm.

The latter is modeled in a probabilistic framework to account for the uncertainty in the building occupancy. The energy management task essentially consists in the minimization of the energy consumption of the cooling system, while preserving comfort in the building. This is achieved by a twofold strategy. The cooling power request is optimally distributed among the chillers and the thermal storage unit. At the same time, a slight modulation of the temperature set-point of the zone is allowed, trading energy saving for comfort. The problem can be decoupled into a static optimization problem (mainly addressing the chiller plant optimization) and a dynamic programming (DP) problem for a discrete time stochastic hybrid system (SHS) that takes care of the overall energy minimization. The DP problem is solved by abstracting the SHS to a (finite) controlled Markov chain, where costs associated with state transitions are computed by simulating the original model and determining the corresponding energy consumption. A numerical example shows the efficacy of the approach.","1545-5955;15455955","","10.1109/TASE.2016.2635109","project LO1506 of the Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports; 10.13039/501100000780 - European Commission through the UnCoVerCPS project; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7814233","Approximate dynamic programming (DP);Markov chain (MC) abstraction;cooling systems;energy management;stochastic hybrid systems (SHSs)","Buildings;Cooling;Dynamic programming;Energy management;Optimization;Stochastic processes;Thermal management","Markov processes;buildings (structures);dynamic programming;energy conservation;energy consumption;energy management systems;minimisation;space cooling;thermal energy storage","building cooling system;building occupancy;chiller plant;controlled Markov chain;cooling load;discrete time stochastic hybrid system;dynamic programming problem;energy consumption minimization;energy management system;energy saving;overall energy minimization;probabilistic framework;static optimization problem;thermal storage unit","","","","","","","20170111","April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Integration of KBs has attracted much attention as different KBs usually contain overlapping and complementary information. Automatic techniques for KB integration have been improved but far from perfect. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of knowledge base semantic integration using crowd intelligence. There are both classes and instances in a KB, in our work, we propose a novel hybrid framework for KB semantic integration considering the semantic heterogeneity of KB class structures. We first perform semantic integration of the class structures via crowdsourcing, then apply the blocking-based instance matching approach according to the integrated class structure. For class structure (taxonomy) semantic integration, the crowd is leveraged to help identifying the semantic relationships between classes to handle the semantic heterogeneity problem. Under the conditions of both large scale KBs and limited monetary budget for crowdsourcing, we formalize the class structure (taxonomy) semantic integration problem as a Local Tree Based Query Selection (LTQS) problem. We show that the LTQS problem is NP-hard and propose two greedy-based algorithms, i.e., static query selection and adaptive query selection. Furthermore, the KBs are usually of large scales and have millions of instances, direct pairwise-based instance matching is inefficient. Therefore, we adopt the blockingbased strategy for instance matching, taking advantage of the class structure (taxonomy) integration result. The experiments on real large scale KBs verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2017.2656086","Hong Kong RGC; Microsoft Research Asia Fellowship; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China; Shandong Province Higher Education Institutions; 10.13039/501100001809 - NSFC; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Science Foundation of China (NSFC); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828140","Knowledge base;crowdsourcing;data integration","Computer science;Crowdsourcing;Data integration;Knowledge based systems;Ontologies;Semantics;Taxonomy","computational complexity;crowdsourcing;data integration;greedy algorithms;knowledge based systems;query processing;semantic Web;trees (mathematics)","KB class structures;LTQS problem;NP-hard problem;adaptive query selection;automatic KB integration techniques;blocking-based instance matching approach;class structure semantic integration problem;crowd intelligence;crowdsourcing;greedy-based algorithms;hybrid framework;integrated class structure;knowledge base semantic integration;local tree based query selection problem;semantic Web;semantic heterogeneity problem;semantic relationships;static query selection","","","","","","","20170120","May 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most existing video fingerprinting methods use a single feature or concatenate different features to generate video fingerprints, and show good performance under single-mode modifications such as noise addition and blurring. However, when they suffer combined modifications, the performance is degraded to a certain extent because such features cannot characterize the video content completely. By contrast, the assistance and consensus among different features can improve the performance of video fingerprinting. Therefore, in the present study, we mine the assistance and consensus among different features based on a tensor model, and we present a new comprehensive feature to fully use them in the proposed video fingerprinting framework. We also analyze what the comprehensive feature really is for representing the original video. In this framework, the video is initially set as a high-order tensor that consists of different features, and the video tensor is decomposed via the Tucker model with a solution that determines the number of components. Subsequently, the comprehensive feature is generated by the low-order tensor obtained from tensor decomposition. Finally, the video fingerprint is computed using this feature. A matching strategy used for narrowing the search is also proposed based on the core tensor. The robust video fingerprinting framework is resistant not only to single-mode modifications but also to their combination.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2016.2629758","Fostering Project of Dominant Discipline and Talent Team of Shandong Province Higher Education Institutions; NSFC Joint Fund with Guangdong under Key Project; Shandong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100007129 - Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7745950","Comprehensive feature;multiple features;near-duplicate video detection (NDVD);robust video fingerprinting","Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Fingerprint recognition;Media;Robustness;Sun;Tensile stress","feature extraction;fingerprint identification;image matching;image representation;object detection;tensors;video signal processing","NDVD;Tucker model;content-based near-duplicate video detection;feature-based robust video fingerprinting;high-order tensor;low-order tensor;matching strategy;tensor decomposition;tensor model;video content;video representation;video tensor","","1","","","","","20161116","April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents a mixed similarity strategy which generates Chinese multiple choice distractors with a statistical regression model including orthographic, phonological and semantic features, i.e. features that were shown in previous psycholinguistics studies to contribute to character recognition. In a first experiment, we evaluated the predictive power of the proposed features in measuring Chinese character similarity. One of the significant experimental results showed that the combination of the four proposed categories of features (structure, semantic radical, stroke and meaning) accounts for 62.5% of the variance in the human judgments of character similarity. In the second experiment, a user study was conducted to evaluate the quality of system-generated questions using a test item analysis method. 296 Chinese primary school students (10-11-year-old) participated in this study. We have compared the mixed strategy with other three common distractor generation strategies, orthographic strategy, semantic strategy and phonological strategy.

The first group minimizes the redundancy of features between each other. The second group maximizes the new classification information of features providing for the selected subset. A critical issue is that large new information does not signify little redundancy, and vice versa. Features with large new information but with high redundancy may be selected by the second group, and features with low redundancy but with little relevance with classes may be highly scored by the first group. Existing approaches fail to balance the importance of both terms. As such, a new information term denoted as Independent Classification Information is proposed in this paper. It assembles the newly provided information and the preserved information negatively correlated with the redundant information. Redundancy and new information are properly unified and equally treated in the new term. This strategy helps find the predictive features providing large new information and little redundancy. Moreover, independent classification information is proved as a loose upper bound of the total classification information of feature subset. Its maximization is conducive to achieve a high global discriminative performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approach.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2017.2650906","Humanities and Social Science; Joint Fund of NSFC-Basic Research Institute of General Technology; Research Fund for International Young Scientists; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; 10.13039/501100006606 - Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7812571","Feature selection;feature redundancy;independent classification information;mutual information","Computers;Correlation;Entropy;Mutual information;Redundancy;Target recognition;Upper bound","feature selection;pattern classification","feature selection;high global discriminative performance;independent classification information maximization","","","","","","","20170110","April 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Guided by the social constructivism paradigm and using critical race theory (CRT) as a theoretical framework that places race at the center of educational research and discourse, we provide conditions for the successful implementation of the case study as a teaching and learning strategy for culturally responsive, inclusive education that may improve academic learner performance for indigenous students. After receiving an Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program grant, one institution provided distributed, community-based instruction to rural areas and fostered a community of practice to support pre-service school library teachers. This article presents approaches and assessments based on the program that incorporated a culturally responsive pedagogy in its specialized curriculum and created information literacy resources to improve student success in racially diverse and economically disadvantaged northeast Oklahoma schools and communities. The article further reviews factors that influenced learning and teaching in this program. Significant contributions include the creation of a unique program that provides a framework for practicing professionals in K-12.

Such an economy needs a well-designed and comprehensive strategy to enhance employability of its youth including students by focusing on creating a database of vocational engineering skills available in the country, expansion of avenues to provide vocational training and increase the range of coverage of understanding about the technical aspects of engineering education. Concerned with the dwindling interest and innovation in the engineering profession in India, a 5-year strategy was charted to provide direction to the talented yet uninitiated youth about engineering as a career. This involved creating a master plan using IEEE TISP as foundation, and localization with collaboration of Local Government Entities, which has been seen as an important factor missing from similar global initiatives. The end result was a two-pronged approach: TISP Kerala by willing societal contributors from the IEEE community and `Additional Skill Acquisition Program' (ASAP) by the Govt. of Kerala driven through the state-wide education machinery. With TISP, 393 Volunteers (IEEE Student Members & Pre-University Educators) were trained in Train the Trainer Programs across 8 Locations in Kerala over the span of one week; 60,000 Pre-university students were trained by these volunteers over the course of the following years to ensure sustainability of the program. ASAP helped reach out to more than 80,000 students across the state and continues to mature as a program in combination with TISP. The strategy has helped raise interest in Engineering as a career option in the state.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2432-2; POD:978-1-5090-2433-9; USB:978-1-5090-2431-5","10.1109/GHTC.2016.7857302","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7857302","ASAP;Additional skill acquisition program;component pre university students;hands on workshop;stem education;teacher in service program;tisp;young professionals","Conferences;Decision support systems;Education","engineering education;multiskilling;vocational training","ASAP;IEEE TISP;IEEE community;India;TISP Kerala;additional skill acquisition program;career option;economic growth;engineering education;engineering profession;local government entities;vocational engineering skills;vocational training;workforce skill;youth employability","","","","","","","","13-16 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is a need to evaluate the quality of the best flipped learning approach that could enhance students' ICT skills as mastering ICT skill is becoming the key of learning in this 21st century. The ability to educate students for higher order learning using technology does enhance the learning processes as compared to the traditional settings. There are only a few studies conducted on the students taking ICT subject and none have in depth studies in their ICT skills. Therefore, this paper proposed a new flipped classroom model that increases students' ICT skills. The model incorporates the Social Constructivism theory and Flipped Classroom Model that are derived from blended learning.

Although the Jordanian government runs a campaign promoting voting in parliamentary elections, the voters' turnout to elections is not high. This research paper therefore introduces the concept of the digital divide and its impact on e-voting system adoption. A framework for e-voting digital divide factors is proposed which presents the main factors that would influence voters' intentions to use an online voting (e-voting) system. These factors comprise: age, education, income, and internet use. With the impact of these factors articulated, this research paper is significant in helping the Jordanian government to develop a strategy to ensure higher participation by voters in selecting their candidates.

We let each node caches M files from a library of size m ≥ M. Each node in the network requests a file from the library independently at random, according to a popularity distribution, and is served by other nodes having the requested file in their local cache via (possibly) multihop transmissions. Under the classical “protocol model” of wireless networks, we characterize the optimal per-node capacity scaling law for a broad class of heavy-tailed popularity distributions, including Zipf distributions with exponent less than one. In the parameter regime of interest, i.e., m=o(nM), we show that a decentralized random caching strategy with uniform probability over the library yields the optimal per-node capacity scaling of Θ(√M/m) for heavy-tailed popularity distributions. This scaling is constant with n , thus yielding throughput scalability with the network size. Furthermore, the multihop capacity scaling can be significantly better than for the case of single-hop caching networks, for which the per-node capacity is Θ (M/m). The multihop capacity scaling law can be further improved for a Zipf distribution with exponent larger than some threshold > 1, by using a decentralized random caching uniformly across a subset of most popular files in the library. Namely, ignoring a subset of less popular files (i.e., effectively reducing the size of the library) can significantly improve the throughput scaling while guaranteeing that all nodes will be served with high probability as n increases.","0018-9448;00189448","","10.1109/TIT.2017.2654341","Alexander von Humboldt Professorship; 10.13039/100000001 - NSF; 10.13039/501100003725 - Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7820112","Caching;device-to-device networks;multihop transmission;scaling laws","Ad hoc networks;Device-to-device communication;Libraries;Protocols;Spread spectrum communication;Throughput;Wireless communication","probability;protocols;radio networks","Zipf distributions;decentralized random caching strategy;heavy-tailed popularity distribution;multihop capacity scaling law;multihop transmissions;optimal per-node capacity scaling law;protocol model;single-hop caching network;throughput scalability;uniform probability;wireless multihop device-to-device caching network","","","","","","","20170117","March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The method considers both sampling scale of a point and relations among points, and is proven to be solvable by graph cuts.

However, almost all the existing RFID estimation protocols are dedicated to the estimation problem on a single set, regardless of tag categories. A feasible solution is to separately execute the existing estimation protocols on each category. The execution time of such a serial solution is proportional to the number of categories, and cannot satisfy the delay-stringent application scenarios. Simultaneous RIFD estimation over multiple categories is desirable, and hence, this paper proposes an approach called simultaneous estimation for multi-category RFID systems (SEM). SEM exploits the Manchester-coding mechanism, which is supported by the ISO 18000-6 RFID standard, to decode the combined signals, thereby simultaneously obtaining the reply status of tags from each category. As a result, multiple bit vectors are decoded from just one physical slotted frame. Built on our SEM, many existing excellent estimation protocols can be used to estimate the tag cardinality of each category in a simultaneous manner. To ensure the predefined accuracy, we calculate the variance of the estimate in one round, as well as the variance of the average estimate in multiple rounds. To find the optimal frame size, we propose an efficient binary search-based algorithm. To address significant variance in category sizes, we propose an adaptive partitioning (AP) strategy to group categories of similar sizes together and execute the estimation protocol for each group separately. Compared with the existing protocols, our approach is much faster, meanwhile satisfying the predefined estimation accuracy. For example, with 20 categories, the proposed SEM+AP is about seven times faster than prior estimation schemes. Moreover, our approach is the only one whose normalized esti- ation time (i.e., time per category) decreases as the number of categories increases.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2016.2594481","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Japan Ministry of Information and Communication through the Strategic Information and Communications Research and Development Promotion Program titled ¿Living Activity and Health Tracking in Smart Home using RF Reflection and Big Data,¿ 2016-2018; Jiangsu Future Internet Program; Jiangsu High-Level Innovation and Entrepreneurship (Shuangchuang) Program; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; Tianjin Key Laboratory of Advanced Networking, Tianjin, China; 10.13039/100000001 - NSF; 10.13039/501100001809 - NSFC; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - State Key Program of National Natural Science of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7574264","Manchester coding;RFID;adaptive partitioning;cardinality estimation;multi-category","Computer science;Electronic mail;Encoding;Estimation;IEEE transactions;Protocols;Radiofrequency identification","protocols;radiofrequency identification","ISO 18000-6 RFID standard;Manchester-coding mechanism;RFID estimation protocols;adaptive partitioning strategy;multicategory RFID estimation;multicategory radio frequency identification estimation","","1","","","","","20160922","Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose a two-level hierarchical control framework for large-scale urban traffic networks. At the upper level, based on decomposing a heterogeneous traffic network into several homogeneous subnetworks, a higher level optimization problem using the concept of macroscopic fundamental diagram is formulated to deal with the traffic demand-balance problem. At the lower level, the controller with a more detailed traffic flow model for each subnetwork determines the optimal signal timing within the given region under the guidance of the upper-level controller through communication. For the application of this architecture in real time, the model-based predictive control approach is utilized so as to obtain the best solutions for both levels. Moreover, in order to decrease the computational complexity, a distributed control scheme within each subnetwork is developed at the lower level. The proposed approach is evaluated by simulation under different scenarios on a hypothetical urban traffic network, and the performance is compared with that of other control strategies.","1063-6536;10636536","","10.1109/TCST.2016.2572169","Shanghai Education Council Innovation Research Project; 10.13039/501100001809 - Joint Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research-National Natural Science Foundation of China Project through the Project entitled Multi-Level Predictive Traffic Control for Large-Scale Urban Networks; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100005089 - Beijing Natural Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7488982","Hierarchical control;large-scale urban traffic networks;macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD);model predictive control (MPC)","Computational modeling;Control systems;Nickel;Optimization;Predictive control;Predictive models;Vehicles","computational complexity;distributed control;hierarchical systems;network theory (graphs);optimal control;optimisation;predictive control;road traffic control;robust control","big cities;computational complexity;detailed traffic flow model;distributed control;heterogeneous traffic network;homogeneous subnetworks;hypothetical urban traffic network;large-scale urban traffic networks;model-based predictive control;network-wide large-scale urban traffic network control;optimal signal timing;traffic congestion;traffic demand-balance problem;two-level hierarchical model-based predictive control;upper-level controller","","","","","","","20160610","March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To this purpose we formulate a novel location problem where the minimum subset of roads on which traffic emission monitors are located is to be found only using the topological structure and some other available information of the traffic network. We solve this problem by transforming it into a graph-theoretic problem and considering more characteristics such as the traffic regulations and limits. After modeling the real-world traffic network as a digraph, a two-step algorithm is developed. The first step is to find all directed circuits to establish hypergraph-based set of directed circuits using the depth first searching strategy. In the second step, an approximation algorithm is designed to find the greedy transversal which is a subset of roads to place vehicle emission monitors in order to cover all the traffic circuits. The performance of the location strategy is validated by both theoretical developments and illustrative examples.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMC.2016.2607221","1000-Talent Youth Program; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Key Research and Development Program; National High-Tech Research and Development Program of China 863 Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Scientific Research Staring Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars and Ministry of Education of China; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Youth Top-Notch Talent Support Program; Youth Yangtze River Scholar; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7842596","Intelligence transportation;location strategy;urban air pollution;vehicle emission monitor","Air pollution;Atmospheric measurements;Measurement by laser beam;Monitoring;Pollution measurement;Remote sensing;Roads","","","","","","","","","20170203","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In the DPSO-LS algorithm, a novel movement modification equation with variable exploration vector is designed to effectively update particles, enabling swarms to cover large areas of search space with large probability and thus the global search ability is enhanced. Moreover, a Gaussian-distribution-based dynamic opposition-based learning strategy is developed to help the pBest jump out local optima.

Finally, the proposed algorithm is applied to multiple parameter estimation including the VSI nonlinearities of a PMSM.

Healthcare data are however very complex and difficult to manage. This is as a result of the astronomical growth of healthcare data, the high speed at which these data are generated as well as the diversity of data types in healthcare. The capturing, storage, analysis and retrieval of health related data are rapidly shifting from paper based system towards digitization. However, the vast volume as well as the complexity of these data makes it difficult for the data to be processed and analyzed by traditional approaches and techniques. Consequently, technologies such as cloud computing and virtualization are now gradually used for processing massive data effectively and securely in healthcare. Hence, the healthcare system is swiftly becoming a big data industry. Thus, this paper examines the concept of big data in healthcare, its benefits and attendant challenges. This paper revealed that the fragmentation of healthcare data, ethical issues, usability issues as well as security and privacy issues are some of the factors impeding the successful implementation of big data in healthcare. This paper therefore suggests that ensuring security and privacy of healthcare data, the adoption of a standardized healthcare terminology, education strategy and the design of usable systems for processing large volumes of data are some of the ways of successfully implementing big data in healthcare.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4171-8; POD:978-1-5090-4172-5","10.1109/FTC.2016.7821747","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7821747","big data;healthcare;information and communication technology","Big data;Biomedical imaging;Cloud computing;Databases;Google;Medical services;Security","Big Data;health care","Big Data;data complexity;data diversity;education strategy;healthcare data privacy;healthcare data security;healthcare system;standardized healthcare terminology","","","","","","","","6-7 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most IQA evaluation mechanisms are based on the pertinence of subjective and objective estimation. Each image distortion type has its own property correlated with human perception. However, this intrinsic property may not be fully exploited by existing IQA methods. In this paper, we make two main contributions to the IQA field. First, a novel IQA method is developed based on a local linear model that examines the distortion between the reference and the distorted images for better alignment with human visual experience. Second, a distortion-specific compensation strategy is proposed to offset the negative effect on IQA modeling caused by different image distortion types. These score offsets are learned from several known distortion types. Furthermore, for an image with an unknown distortion type, a convolutional neural network-based method is proposed to compute the score offset automatically. Finally, an integrated IQA metric is proposed by combining the aforementioned two ideas. Extensive experiments are performed to verify the proposed IQA metric, which demonstrate that the local linear model is useful in human perception modeling, especially for individual image distortion, and the overall IQA method outperforms several state-of-the-art IQA approaches.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2016.2639451","Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at the Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7782841","Image quality assessment;convolutional neural network;distortion-specific compensation;human visual system;local linear model","Computational modeling;Correlation;Distortion;Image quality;Measurement;Neural networks;Visualization","computer vision;convolution;neural nets","IQA evaluation mechanisms;computer vision;convolutional neural network-based method;distortion-specific compensation strategy;human perception modeling;human visual experience;image distortion types;image processing;image quality assessment;intrinsic property;local linear information;objective estimation;score offset;subjective estimation","","","","","","","20161214","Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we present a secure system architecture design as our initial effort toward this direction, which bridges together the advancements of video coding techniques and secure deduplication. Our design enables the cloud with the crucial deduplication functionality to completely eliminate the extra storage and bandwidth cost, which would have been incurred by hosting encrypted videos from different entities. The design is also carefully tailored to the scalable video coding (SVC) techniques to support heterogeneous networks and devices for high-quality adaptive video dissemination. We show fully functional system implementations with structure-aware encryption design and structure-aware deduplication strategies that are both completely compliant with the video format in SVC. Extensive security analysis and experiments via our prototype deployed on Azure cloud platform show the practicality of the design.

In this strategy, a new method that groups decision variables is first proposed, in which all the decision variables are partitioned into two subcomponents according to their interrelation with environment. Adopting two populations to cooperatively optimize the two subcomponents, two prediction methods, i.e., differential prediction and Cauchy mutation, are then employed respectively to speed up their responses on the change of the environment. Furthermore, two improved dynamic multi-objective optimization algorithms, i.e., DNSGAII-CO and DMOPSO-CO, are proposed by incorporating the above strategy into NSGA-II and multi-objective particle swarm optimization, respectively. The proposed algorithms are compared with three state-of-the-art algorithms by applying to seven benchmark DMOPs.

Instead, various forms of pervasive developmental disorders are frequently placed in special education classes without an accurate diagnosis. This is something that needs to be rectified because every disability requires different needs and attention. In children with special needs such as children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), it warrants diverse teaching methods to be used. While the use of computer assisted instructions (CAIs) in the West has been found to be effective for children with ASD, research regarding the applicability of CAIs to cater for the learning process of children with special needs in the Malaysian context is still lacking. The present paper reviews previous studies that have employed CAIs to enhance language development of children with ASD.

While the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard greatly enhances the feasibility of 8K with a doubled compression ratio, its implementation is a challenge, owing to ultrahigh-throughput requirements and increased complexity per pixel. The latter comes from the new features of HEVC. At the system level, the most challenging of them is the enlarged and highly variable-size coding/prediction/transform units, which significantly increase the requirement for on-chip memory as pipeline buffers and the difficulty in maintaining pipeline utilization. This paper presents an HEVC decoder chip featuring a system pipeline that works at a nonunified and variable granularity. The pipeline saves on-chip memory with a novel block-in-block-out queue system and a parameter delivery network, while allowing overhead-free and fully pipelined operation of the processing components. With the system pipeline design combined with various component-level optimizations, the proposed decoder in 40 nm achieves a maximum throughput of 4 Gpixels/s or 8K 120 frames/s for the low-delay-P configuration of HEVC, 7.5-55 times faster than prior works. It supports 8K 60 frames/s for the low-delay and random-access configurations.

Aligned with this goal, an infinite time-horizon resource allocation problem is formulated to maximize the time-average MIMO downlink throughput, subject to a time-average energy cost budget. By using the advanced time decoupling technique, a novel stochastic subgradient-based online control approach is developed for the resultant smart-grid powered communication system. It is established analytically that even without a priori knowledge of the independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) processes involved such as channel coefficients, renewables, and electricity prices, the proposed online control algorithm is still able to yield a feasible and asymptotically optimal solution. Numerical results further demonstrate that the proposed algorithm also works well in non-i.i.d. scenarios, where the underlying randomness is highly correlated over time.","0733-8716;07338716","","10.1109/JSAC.2016.2600543","China Recruitment Program of Global Young Experts; 10.13039/100000001 - U.S. NSF; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100003395 - Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission; 10.13039/501100004602 - Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7544445","MIMO broadcast channels;renewable energy sources;smart grids;stochastic optimization","Batteries;Downlink;Energy efficiency;Green communications;MIMO;Random processes;Resource management;Smart grids;Stochastic processes","MIMO communication;next generation networks;renewable energy sources;resource allocation;smart power grids;stochastic processes;telecommunication power management","advanced time decoupling technique;distribution grid;dynamic resource allocation;infinite time-horizon resource allocation problem;next-generation multi-input multi-output communication systems;renewable energy sources;smart-grid powered MIMO downlink transmissions;stochastic subgradient-based online control approach","","","","","","","20160816","Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose a new mathematical formulation approach to calculate the cognitive indicator activity linked to learner's cognitive activity, in accordance with a proposed course content structure. This Cognitive indicator includes and aims to study knowledge, memory and reasoning variables. In learning environment, reasoning is based on processing information and using knowledge stored in memory. The challenges associated to construct the three variables are far from being merely theoretical concerns, conditioning the structure of educational content to teach and knowledge assessment acquire by learners.

Because most parameters of the metabolic network cannot be directly measured, they must be estimated by using optimization algorithms. However, three characteristics of the metabolic network model, i.e., high nonlinearity, large amount parameters, and huge variation scopes of parameters, restrict the application of many traditional optimization algorithms. As a result, there is a growing demand to develop efficient optimization approaches to address this complex problem. In this paper, a Kriging-based algorithm aiming at parameter estimation is presented for constructing the metabolic networks. In the algorithm, a new infill sampling criterion, named expected improvement and mutual information (EI&MI), is adopted to improve the modeling accuracy by selecting multiple new sample points at each cycle, and the domain decomposition strategy based on the principal component analysis is introduced to save computing time. Meanwhile, the convergence speed is accelerated by combining a single-dimensional optimization method with the dynamic coordinate perturbation strategy when determining the new sample points. Finally, the algorithm is applied to the arachidonic acid metabolic network to estimate its parameters.

A crucial problem in these kinds of in-contact tasks is the context specificity of pose and force requirements. In this paper, a robot learns in-contact tasks from human kinesthetic demonstrations. To address the need to balance between the position and force constraints, we propose a model based on the hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) and Cartesian impedance control. The model captures uncertainty over time and space and allows the robot to smoothly satisfy a task's position and force constraints by online modulation of impedance controller stiffness according to the HSMM state belief. In experiments, a KUKA LWR 4+ robotic arm equipped with a force/torque sensor at the wrist successfully learns from human demonstrations how to pull a door handle and push a button.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3762-9; POD:978-1-5090-3763-6; USB:978-1-5090-3761-2","10.1109/IROS.2016.7759127","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7759127","","Education;Force;Hidden Markov models;Impedance;Robot sensing systems;Trajectory","dexterous manipulators;elastic constants;force sensors;hidden Markov models;intelligent robots;manipulator kinematics;torque measurement","Cartesian impedance control;HSMM;HSMM state belief;KUKA LWR 4+ robotic arm;context specificity;force sensor;hidden semiMarkov model;human kinesthetic demonstrations;impedance controller stiffness;learning in-contact control strategy-from-demonstration;online modulation;pose requirements;task force constraint;task position constraints;torque sensor","","","","","","","","9-14 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the training of engineers and doctors in electrical engineering requires practices and know-how that are mandatory for designing new and innovative objects that are today highly complex, covering several domains of expertise, and also very frequently connected. The main challenge is to give to our future engineers both methodology and know-how that cannot be provided by the online lectures.

"Exploring positive deviance for enhancing learning outcomes in higher education and training","L. Kionig; T. Vold; R. Braun","Faculty of Business Administration, Hedmark University of Applied Sciences, Rena, Norway","2016 15th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training (ITHET)","20161201","2016","","","1","4","Due to the terror actions of the 22<sup>nd</sup> of July 2011 there has been an increased focus on the preparedness and also training for handling and managing crisis. Organizations and municipalities are obliged to have plans for handling crises and plans for training their employees. The focus is often to learn from what went wrong and most reports focus on the improvement areas, implying that there are faults and deficiencies. Positive Deviance (PD) is about looking for success stories, when the statistics imply that it should not be a success. The term PD was in the 1990's introduced and explored by nutrition professor Marian Zeitlin in her book “Positive Deviance in Nutrition” at Tufts University. Also visiting Tufts University was Jerry and Monique Sternin which brought the ideas further and developed it as a tool for social change. From the PD webpage www.positivedeviance.org, we find: “Positive Deviance is based on the observation that in every community there are certain individuals or groups whose uncommon behaviors and strategies enable them to find better solutions to problems than their peers, while having access to the same resources and facing similar or worse challenges. The Positive Deviance approach is an asset-based, problem-solving, and community-driven approach that enables the community to discover these successful behaviors and strategies and develop a plan of action to promote their adoption by all concerned.” However, to look for the small successes and explore “why this was a success”, is also possible in other areas than within social change. Which (minor) elements contributed to how this actually had a successful ending, even if the surrounding factors indicated failure? In finding these minor details that contributed to an unexpected success lay a learning potential that is worth exploring, for instance in the area of Crisi- Training. One student group in the Crisis Communication course received a task that was about discovering and explaining PD in crisis communication in a municipality. This student group was struck by the fact that the respondents were so positive and elaborated so freely about the success stories and how they seemed to reflect upon the reasons why the successes came about. Their respondents very much appreciated this type of focus, rather than “defending” the cases that went wrong or were unsuccessful.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0778-3; POD:978-1-5090-0779-0; USB:978-1-5090-0777-6","10.1109/ITHET.2016.7760748","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7760748","","Best practices;Crisis management;Pregnancy;Training","Internet;computer based training;educational courses;emergency management;further education","PD Web page;crisis communication course;crisis handling;crisis training;employee training;higher education;learning outcome enhancement;positive deviance","","","","","","","","8-10 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Learning Agreements are especially useful tools for scaffolding learning in courses with a focus on developing the professional competencies of students, such as in Open Ended Group Projects, Work Integrated Learning or other authentic learning contexts. Such educational contexts are complex and we have found it necessary to scaffold student learning using agreements based on professional competencies. This has led to a pedagogical framework, which has found successful application in a number of contexts. This framework has been built based on discussions with students, and has involved the development of a supporting wiki which contains descriptions of the different professional competencies involved in the learning agreement. The IT based framework has been iteratively developed together with the students taking the course in the fall of 2015. The development and assessment of this framework is contrasted in the context of two courses using learning agreements, one (in Sweden) with a focus on development of professional competencies and the other (in New Zealand) addressing a mix of professional competencies and subject knowledge in a work integrated learning setting.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1790-4; POD:978-1-5090-1791-1","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757718","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757718","Authentic learning;Distributed teams;Global Collaboration;Learning Agreements;Open Ended Group Projects;Personas","Collaboration;Computers;Context;Contracts;Employment;Writing","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses","active learning;authentic learning;course;open ended group projects;work integrated learning;writing learning agreements","","","","","","","","12-15 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Constantly growing number of universities and decreasing number of secondary education graduates cope with many challenges. Higher education institutions need an appropriate strategy, a necessity reflected in numerous calls for research on strategy in the higher education sector. It is important to realize, that the university in the emerging market is striving to gain sustainable competitive advantage. This paper makes an attempt to study university marketing communication. It presents multiple statistics indexes which are developed in different time periods. It is understood that the choice which university makes in selecting the right way of marketing communication determines the success. Universities with targeted marketing communication demonstrated higher chances of gain competitive advantage. Drawing from these trends, paper describes the main critical attributes that the slovak universities have to challenge. The competition strategy is presented by the case study from the University of Zilina, where sustainable steps have to be realized to keep competitive position at the higher education market. Drawing from these trends, three core challenges are identified, that higher education institutions will face and these have fundamental implications for the research and practice: first, the need to enhance prestige and market share. The paper describes the significance of criterias, accoarding to which potential student make decision when choosing an university. Potential student face a number of criterias: how to select the university that is best for him/her, how is the university reputation, what is the consistence of programs with potential student values and careergoals, conducive environment etc. Potential student determines the order of criteria importance. In a process of selecting, potential student has certain information obtained f- om various sources, and no each source have the same importance and gravity for this student. Each university have different marketing communication. The paper also answers one of the research questions-which form of marketing communication reach the target group of potential student the most. The paper compare and evaluate the importance of information about the university with potential student expectations. Paper further describes changes in marketing communication with secondary education graduates as well as the changes in demand attributes. Secondly, the necessity to embrace an entrepreneurial mindset - education used to be considered a public good, provided by nonprofit organizations that were unexposed to market pressure and had clear societal missions. Now, education is becoming a global service delivered by quasi-companies in an ever-more complex and competitive knowledge marketplace. This article's purpose is to contribute to this discussion by providing prescriptive quidance to higher education managers in areas of competiton strategy and sustainability of higher education. Paper also describes key trends that will impact higher education in the short to medium terms as well.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0778-3; POD:978-1-5090-0779-0; USB:978-1-5090-0777-6","10.1109/ITHET.2016.7760708","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7760708","competition;higher education;higher education critical attribute;marketing communication;potential student;university","Education;Market research;Organizations;Recruitment;Social network services;Standards organizations;TV","educational institutions;further education;marketing;statistics","Slovak republic;emerging market;higher education institutions;potential student expectations;secondary education graduates;statistics indexes;sustainable competitive advantage;university marketing communication","","","","","","","","8-10 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the interdependence, node failures in one network may lead to failures of the other network and result in cascading failures of the whole system. One of the reasons for this phenomena is attributed to the connectivity of the interdependent system, which hinges heavily on the operation probability (or equivalently reliability) of networks in the light of node reliability. In this paper, we present the model of k-reliability, define cascading failures based on k-reliability, and propose an algorithm to calculate k-reliability for estimation of potential cascading failures. The proposed k-reliability, defined as the probability that at least k surviving nodes span an operating subnetwork, explains the operation probability of the system and reflects the connectivity of nodes in networks. In particular, we find that the network with regular interlink allocation strategy is homogeneous to the network with maximum k-reliability in class of graphs with 2n nodes and 2d edges when the information of intratopology is unknown. That is, regardless of the information of each individual network, the strategy that all nodes in the system are allotted the same number of bidirectional interlinks yields better performance on k- reliability than all other possible strategies both analytically and experimentally.","0018-9529;00189529","","10.1109/TR.2016.2606125","10.13039/100007219 - Natural Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100003395 - Shanghai Municipal Education Commission; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7572896","Cascading failures;cyber-physical system;k-reliability","Computer network reliability;Cyber-physical systems;Modeling;Power system faults;Power system protection;Telecommunication network reliability","cyber-physical systems;graph theory;software reliability;system recovery","bidirectional interlinks;cascading failures;cyber network overlays;cyber-physical system;interdependent system;k-reliability model;node failures;node reliability;operating subnetwork;operation probability;physical network;regular interlink allocation strategy;two interacting networks","","","","","","","20160921","Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In addition, we investigate downtilts of antenna patterns at the base stations. To further improve the throughput of massive MIMO networks, we propose a beam switching tilting strategy which adopts different downtilts to serve each divided vertical region. A partition time-slots algorithm is developed according to the number of users in each region.

Most of the algorithms do not scale well with the number of objectives due to the expansion of the objective space. In this paper, a hybrid evolutionary algorithm with dual populations (HEA-DP) is proposed to tackle many-objective problems. The algorithm combines the advantages of decomposition-based and indicator-based approaches by maintaining two populations. The fitness values of individuals in the first population are determined by an aggregation function, while individuals in the second population are evaluated according to an efficient performance indicator. The information about the objective space is shared by employing a reproduction strategy that chooses parents from both populations. In this way, the algorithm can explore the objective space more thoroughly and can have more stable performance. Several state-of-the-art many-objective algorithms are adopted as peer algorithms to validate the proposed algorithm. We test the algorithms on two commonly used many-objective problem suites using different numbers of objectives.

Unlike previous studies that have considered a logarithmic utility defined with respect to the sum rate, we maximize the sum rate directly to achieve the best user association for the HetNet. To capture realistic communication scenarios, we also consider a minimum rate constraint for individual users. The corresponding problem is formulated as a combinatorial optimization of which finding the solution becomes computationally demanding as the size of the network grows. Another challenge in HetNets is that the information exchange among base stations (BSs) is limited if each tier of BSs is deployed by different network vendors or users, and this brings about the need for distributed control. To resolve these challenges, we introduce a promising approach based on a message-passing framework and derive a distributed load-balancing algorithm. The proposed algorithm developed via message passing provides a very efficient solution for the load-balancing problem with reduced computational complexity. We compare the proposed algorithm with existing load-balancing strategies. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm significantly improves resource utilization and mitigates the congestion of macro BSs, thereby resulting in a multifold gain to the sum rate.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2016.2519921","Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning of Korea Government; 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; 10.13039/501100003725 - Basic Science Research Program through NRF; 10.13039/501100003725 - National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7387784","Distributed algorithm;heterogeneous network;load balancing;message passing;user association","Bandwidth;Computational complexity;Load management;Load modeling;Macrocell networks;Optimization;Simulation","cellular radio;combinatorial mathematics;computational complexity;message passing;optimisation;resource allocation","HetNet;base stations;combinatorial optimization;computational complexity;distributed load-balancing algorithm;heterogeneous cellular networks;message passing","","","","","","","20160120","Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Indeed, English literacy is introduced to young students at the pre-primary level as it is a pre-requisite for all other subjects, except French language in Standard One of primary level. In consequence, it is imperative that students acquire English literacy skills at pre-primary level. Students face difficulties in shifting from their mother tongue to English and they fail lamentably at the very outset to follow English instructions given to them orally or in text. Therefore, the aim of this research is to investigate on the difficulties faced by students in their learning of English language. Moreover, the requirements of relevant learning activities are investigated in order to identify the functionalities that will help develop a supporting remedial ICT tool for the primary level students. As methodology, for the requirements determination, an intensive analysis of the literature, an analysis of the existing tools and the administration of a questionnaire to the educators of Standard 1 enabled the understanding of the difficulties and needs of lower primary school students. Instructional designing as well as online pedagogy will serve as guidance to design an educational software with appropriate learning strategies and learning activities.

Due to the large size of scientific datasets, data placement plays an important role in scientific cloud workflow systems for improving system performance and reducing data transfer cost. Traditional task-level data placement strategy only considers shared datasets within individual workflows to reduce data transfer cost. However, it is obvious that task-level strategy is not necessarily good enough for the situation of multiple workflows at the workflow level. In this paper, a novel workflow-level data placement model is constructed, which regards multiple workflows as a whole. Then, a two-stage data placement strategy is proposed which first pre-allocates initial datasets to proper datacenters during workflow build-time stage, and then dynamically distributes newly generated datasets to appropriate datacenters during runtime stage. Both stages use an efficient discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm to place flexible-location datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our workflow-level data placement strategy can be more cost-effective than its task-level counterpart for data-sharing scientific cloud workflows.","1939-1374;19391374","","10.1109/TSC.2016.2625247","Key Natural Science Foundation of Education Bureau of Anhui Province; 10.13039/501100000923 - Australian Research Council; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7736111","Cloud computing;data placement;data-sharing;particle swarm optimization;scientific workflow","Algorithm design and analysis;Cloud computing;Data models;Data transfer;Distributed databases;Particle swarm optimization;Runtime","","","","","","","","","20161104","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

With the implementation of cloud DCs (CDCs) and EON virtualization, achieving EON embedding (EONE) is essential, which includes two components: node mapping from the virtual machine to the CDC and link mapping from the virtual lightpath to fiber link(s). In particular, the link mapping must satisfy some rigid constraints in terms of spectrum continuity, consistency, and nonoverlapping, which may create spectrum fragments over fiber links. Thus, in this paper, we reoptimize the virtual concatenation (VCAT) framework accompanied by the hitless push-pull spectrum movement (PPSM) function when the common link mapping fails. Our design framework integrates spectrum movement with inverse multiplexing such that more EONE requests can be satisfied by performing effective spectrum defragmentation. We also optimize the number of subbands with a constrained buffer size to compensate the differential delay at the receiving end. The problem is formulated using the relaxed integer linear programming (ILP) model, and the corresponding heuristic tailored to four different service-sorting strategies is also designed. The simulation results verify the superiority of our method in terms of increasing the spectrum efficiency and reducing the blocking rate of EONE requests. This paper is the first work to focus on designing a reoptimized VCAT framework accompanied by the hitless PPSM function for the EONE that includes both node and link mapping processes rather than a simple spectrum defragmentation.","0733-8724;07338724","","10.1109/JLT.2016.2602340","Foundation of the Education Department of Liaoning Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National High-Level Personnel Special Support Program for Youth Top-Notch Talent; Open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Information Photonics and Optical Communications; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7551126","Buffer-size constraint;elastic optical network embedding;inverse multiplexing optimization;push-pull spectrum movement;virtual concatenation","Cloud computing;Dynamic scheduling;Frequency selective surfaces;Indexes;Optical fiber networks;Radio spectrum management;Substrates","integer programming;linear programming;multiplexing;optical fibre networks;virtual machines","CDC;EON embedding;EON virtualization;EONE;ILP;blocking rate;cloud DC;constrained buffer size;data centers;differential delay;elastic optical network;fiber links;fine-grained slots;high-rate data transmission;hitless PPSM function;hitless push-pull spectrum movement function;inverse multiplexing;link mapping processes;node mapping;orthogonal frequency slots;receiving end;relaxed integer linear programming model;reoptimized VCAT framework;service-sorting strategy;spectrum consistency;spectrum continuity;spectrum defragmentation;spectrum efficiency;spectrum fragments;spectrum nonoverlapping;virtual concatenation framework;virtual lightpath;virtual machine","","","","","","","20160824","Nov.15, 15 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, due to the selfish nature, small-scale electricity suppliers (SESs) and electricity consumers (ECs) will not participate direct trading if the trading does not bring them benefits. Therefore, how to provide proper economic incentives for these two parties to take part in direct trading is an essential issue. Nevertheless, the asymmetry trading information between them makes the problem challenging. In this paper, we propose a contract based direct trading framework to tackle this challenge, in which the decision making process of ECs and SESs in the presence of asymmetric information is modeled as a contract game. In the proposed game, the EC designs a contract which contains its trading strategies toward all types of SESs. Through the contract, the EC not only attracts SESs to sell electricity but also maximizes its own revenue. The SESs, on the other hand, get maximal benefits if they truthfully select the contract items of their own types. We derive theoretically the optimal contract for the short-term market where the supply of SESs is deterministic. Then we extend our study to the long-term market where the supply of SESs is encountering significant uncertainty. Finally, simulation results are shown to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","1949-3053;19493053","","10.1109/TSG.2016.2622743","Ministry of Science and Technology Taiwan; Open Foundation of State Key Laboratory; U.S. National Natural Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7725484","Direct trading;contract game;smart grid","Contracts;Games;Power markets;Pricing;Production;Smart grids;Uncertainty","","","","","","","","","20161028","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

ICT and mobile Health solutions might improve these conditions, being widely available and providing highly effective communication strategies. Objective: To evaluate whether ICT and mobile Health tools are able to improve hypertension control by improving doctors' engagement and by increasing patients' education and involvement, and their compliance to lifestyle modification and prescribed drug therapy. Methods: In a pilot study, we have included 690 treated hypertensive patients with uncontrolled office blood pressure (BP), consecutively recruited by 9 general practitioners over 3 months. Patients were alternatively assigned to routine management based on repeated office visits or to an integrated ICT-based Patients Optimal Strategy for Treatment (POST) system including Home BP monitoring teletransmission, a dedicated web-based platform for patients' management by physicians (Misuriamo platform), and a smartphone mobile application (Eurohypertension APP, E-APP), over a follow-up of 6 months. BP values, demographic and clinical data were collected at baseline and at all follow-up visits (at least two). BP control and cardiovascular risk level have been evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the study. Results: 89 patients did not complete the follow-up, thus data analysis was carried out in 601 of them (303 patients in the POST group and 298 in the control group). Office BP control (<;149/90 mmHg) was 40.0% in control group, and 72.3% in POST group at 6 month follow-up. At the same time Home BP control (<;135/85 mmHg average of 6 days) in POST group was 87.5%. Conclusion: this pilot study suggests that ICT based tools might be effective in improving hypertension management, implementing positive patients' involvem- nt with better adherence to treatment prescriptions and providing the physicians with dynamic control of patients' home BP measurements, resulting in lesser clinical inertia.","1557-170X;1557170X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0220-4; POD:978-1-4577-0219-8","10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590753","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7590753","","Biomedical monitoring;Blood pressure;Drugs;Education;Hypertension;Mobile communication","biomedical telemetry;blood pressure measurement;diseases;patient monitoring;smart phones;telemedicine","ICT-based tool;Information and Communications Technology;POST pilot study;Patients Optimal Strategy of Treatment;Web-based platform;cardiovascular risk level;clinical data;data analysis;demographic data;eurohypertension app;home blood pressure monitoring;hypertension management;integrated ICT-based POST system;lifestyle modification;mobile Health tool;mobile health integrated approach;patient education;prescribed drug therapy;smartphone mobile application;teletransmission","","","","","","","","16-20 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile phones are widely used in our daily lives. Therefore, the PSN composed of human-carried mobile phones will soon become an ubiquitous network environment. In this paper, we propose a communication strategy that applies the WiFi hotspot mode of a mobile phone in the PSN to realize the device-to-device communications. However, due to the lack of energy supply, a phone in hotspot mode could rapidly consume energy and shorten its battery lifetime significantly. To maximize the message dissemination scope within the limited energy constraint of each phone in PSNs, an Energy-efficient Phone-to-phone Communication method based on WiFi Hotspot (EPCWH) is presented to schedule the phone's switching between hotspot mode and client mode. Simulations based on the synthetic random-waypoint mobility pattern and real traces are conducted in an opportunistic network environment; the results show that EPCWH achieves the best performance in terms of message dissemination and energy consumption among different switching strategies.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2015.2514098","Chinese Scholarship Council; Jilin Province Science and Technology Development Program; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; 10.13039/100000001 - NSF; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7370821","Client mode;energy constraint;hotspot mode;phone-to-phone;pocket switched networks (PSNs);schedule","Energy consumption;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Protocols;Schedules;Smart phones;Switches","mobility management (mobile radio);power consumption;telecommunication power management;telecommunication scheduling;wireless LAN","WiFi hotspot mode;battery lifetime;client mode;device-to-device communications;energy consumption;energy-constrained pocket switched networks;energy-efficient phone-to-phone communication;limited energy constraint;message dissemination;mobile phone;opportunistic network environment;phone switching scheduling;synthetic random-waypoint mobility pattern","","","","","","","20160101","Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we present various state-of-the-art GPU optimization strategies in DWT implementation, such as leveraging shared memory, registers, warp shuffling instructions, and thread- and instruction-level parallelism (TLP, ILP), and finally elaborate our hybrid approach to further boost up its performance. In addition, we introduce a novel mixed-band memory layout for Haar DWT, where multi-level transform can be carried out in a single fused kernel launch. As a result, unlike recent GPU DWT methods that focus mainly on maximizing ILP, we show that the optimal GPU DWT performance can be achieved by hybrid parallelism combining both TLP and ILP together in a mixed-band approach.

However, the selection of DBS parameters is challenging because the mechanism is not well understood. This work proposes the design of a closed-loop control strategy to automatically adjust the parameters of a DBS waveform based on a computational model. By estimating the synaptic input from BG to the thalamic neuron model as feedback variable, we designed and compared various control algorithms to counteract the effects of pathological oscillatory inputs. We then obtained optimal DBS parameters to modulate the tremor-predominant Parkinsonian state. We showed that even a simple proportional controller provides higher fidelity of thalamic relay of sensorimotor information and lower energy expenditure, as compared with classical open-loop DBS. Integral action further enhances DBS performance. Additionally, a positive bias voltage further improves the relay ability of the thalamus with decreased stimulation energy expenditure.

It simultaneously considers the certainty of the clustering model and the continuity with the last clustering model in the clustering process. An iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to solve an optimal solution of the objective function with some constraints.

Both false and miss detections determine the final estimation performance. Deterministic detection methods, which distinctly classify pixels into noisy or uncorrupted pixels, tend to increase the estimation error because some uncorrupted edge points are hard to discriminate from the random-valued impulse noise points. This paper proposes an iterative Structure-adaptive Fuzzy Estimation (SAFE) for random-valued impulse noise suppression. This SAFE method is developed in the framework of Gaussian Maximum Likelihood Estimation (GMLE). The structure-adaptive fuzziness is reflected by two structure-adaptive metrics based on pixel reliability and patch similarity, respectively. The reliability metric for each pixel (as noise free) is estimated via a novel Minimal Path Based Structure Propagation (MPSP) to give full consideration of the spatially varying image structures. A robust iteration stopping strategy is also proposed by evaluating the re-estimation error of the uncorrupted intensity information. Comparative experiment results show that the proposed structure-adaptive fuzziness can lead to effective restoration. Efficient implementation of this SAFE method is also realized via GPU (Graphic Processing Unit)-based parallelization.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2016.2615444","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7583702","Random-valued impulse noise;Structure-adaptive Fuzzy Estimation (SAFE);reliability metric;similarity metric","","","","","1","","","","","20161005","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The proposed algorithm schedules the sensors into a number of disjoint complete cover sets and activates them in batch for energy conservation. It uses a divide-and-conquer strategy of dimensionality reduction, and the polynomial KM algorithm a are hence adopted to splice the feasible solutions obtained in each subarea to enhance the search efficiency substantially. To further improve global efficiency, a redundant-trend sensor schedule strategy was developed.

In this paper, we introduce a weighting strategy to the standard GPR algorithm, and propose a weighted GPR (W-GPR) algorithm. Different from the standard GPR algorithm, the proposed W-GPR algorithm assigns a weight to each observation. In addition, in order to optimize hyper-parameters in the GPR modeling process, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used instead of the traditional gradient method. By means of a numerical example and one chemical process example, the W-GPR algorithm significantly reduces the uncertainty of the prediction, and improves the accuracy of the model.

However, multi-view data are often represented by high-dimensional heterogeneous features, so it is meaningful to find a low-dimensional consensus representation from multiple views. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised multi-view dimensionality reduction method for images based on bi-level latent space learning. As different views have different physical meanings and statistical properties, they are not directly comparable. Therefore, we learn the comparable representation for each view in the first level. The shared and private nature of multi-view data are exploited to accurately preserve the information of each view. Then, we fuse different views into a low-dimensional representation by conducting joint matrix factorization in the second level. To guarantee the lowdimensional representation to be compact and discriminative, the intrinsic geometric structure of data are utilized. Besides, our method considers to resist the outliers and noise contained in multi-view data which may influence the learned representation and deteriorate its semantic consistency. We design appropriate optimization objectives to learn the latent spaces in different levels. Compared with the existing methods, our method could provide a more flexible multi-view learning strategy that not only accurately captures the information of each view but also is robust to outliers and noise, which can obtain a more discriminative and compact low-dimensional representation.

Here, a general framework is presented to analyze the tradeoff among these three performance metrics in cooperative OFDMA systems with decode-and-forward relaying, where subcarrier pairing and allocation, relay selection, choice of transmission strategy, and power allocation are jointly considered. In our analytical framework, rate fairness is represented utilizing the α-fairness model, and the resource allocation problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. We then propose a cross-layer resource allocation algorithm across application and physical layers, and further devise a heuristic algorithm to tackle the computational complexity issue. The SE-EE tradeoff is characterized as a Pareto optimal set, and the efficiency and fairness tradeoff is investigated through the price of fairness. Simulations indicate that higher fairness results in a worse SE-EE tradeoff. It is also shown imposing fairness helps to reduce the outage probability. For a fixed number of relays, by increasing circuit power, the performance of SE-EE tradeoff is degraded. Interestingly, by increasing the number of relays, although the total circuit power is increased, the SE-EE tradeoff is not necessarily degraded.

In this paper, an early termination strategy is proposed for DIRECT mode decision of MVC by exploiting mode homogeneity and rate distortion (RD) cost correlation. By comparing the RD cost between DIRECT mode and Inter$16\times 16$ mode, an adaptive threshold is defined based on the MB's mode homogeneity and RD cost so as to early terminate the remaining inter and intra modes. Experimental results show that compared with the original JMVC model, the proposed approach can reduce the total encoding time from 65.08% to 91.45% (80.43% on average).

An intuitive model of a service market is a reverse auction. In the first price auction, however, a service that is cheaper and provides better quality is not necessarily selected. This causes undesirable outcomes both for users and service providers. A possible solution is the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, where the dominant strategy for a service provider is to report the true cost of his service. In spite of this desirable property, implementing the VCG mechanism for service composition suffers from computational cost. The calculation of payments to service providers based on the VCG mechanism requires iterative service selection, even though each service selection can be NP-hard. Approximation algorithms cannot be applied because approximate solutions do not assure the desirable property of the VCG mechanism. Thus, we model VCG payments for service markets and propose a dynamic programming (DP)-based algorithm for service selection and VCG payment calculation. Our proposed algorithm solves service selection in quasi-polynomial time and gives an exact solution. Moreover, we extend it and focus on the iterative service selection process for VCG payment calculation to improve its performance. Our series of experiments show that our proposed algorithm solves practical scale service composition.","2168-7161;21687161","","10.1109/TCC.2014.2338310","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6853351","Service composition;VCG mechanism;dynamic programming;service selection","Abstracts;Cloud computing;Computational complexity;Computational modeling;Concrete;Licenses;Software as a service","cloud computing;computational complexity;dynamic programming;pricing","VCG payments;Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism;cloud service composition;dynamic programming;iterative service selection process;quasipolynomial time;service markets;strategy-proof pricing","","1","","","","OAPA","20140711","July-Sept. 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To address this challenge, this paper proposes an energy-efficient query optimization mechanism for supporting multiple concurrent applications leveraging our two-tier cooperative caching mechanism. Specifically, query requests for concurrent applications are represented as binary strings, which are reduced to a single one for avoiding the reprocessing of shared subquery requests. This reduced query request is answered through our cooperative caching mechanism, where sensory data, which are highly possible to be reused for answering forthcoming query requests, are cached at the sink node (SN). Besides, the gray model GM(1, 1) is adopted for forecasting sensory data units which may be interested mostly by forthcoming query requests. These units of sensory data may be prefetched from the network and cached at the SN. Experimental evaluation shows that this approach can reduce the energy consumption significantly, and improve the network capacity to an extent, especially when the number of concurrent query requests is relatively large.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMC.2016.2598398","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities China University of Geosciences Beijing; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Scientific Research Foundation for Returned Scholars Ministry of Education of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7551191","Cooperative caching mechanism;data sharing;multiple applications aggregation;shared wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","Computational modeling;Energy consumption;Forecasting;Indexes;Predictive models;Query processing;Wireless sensor networks","","","","1","","","","","20160824","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

For both time-invariant and time-varying fading channels, it is revealed that the optimal transmission between any two consecutive channel or data state changing instants, termed epoch, can only take one of the three strategies: i) no transmission; ii) transmission with an energy-efficiency (EE)-maximizing rate over part of the epoch; or iii) transmission with a rate greater than the EE-maximizing rate over the whole epoch. Based on this specific structure, efficient algorithms are then developed to find the optimal policies that minimize the total energy consumption with low complexity.

Escalations in authentication technologies like behavioral blocks and biometric data breaches are reducing the user's control over the management of their digital identities. Simultaneously, users are becoming more digitally dependant regarding financial transactions, buying food, emotionally connecting with loved ones on social media, managing personal information, and writing personal documents. This research presents a tool to address this issue pulled from the fields of education, political science, psychology, and cyber security. It is combined as a set of models to be delivered as part of information security curricula. Recent analysis of brain scans and population behavior studies have suggested that when people feel their identity at risk and feel disempowered they will have a stronger disposition towards authoritarianism, desire for retribution, and a desire for simplistic solutions instead of acting with reasoned and adaptive responses. Indicators in other fields suggest that the way professionals and educators characterize incidents that threaten digital identity can habituate different types of societal attitudes about the Internet and institutional data usage. The model presented herein should help cyber security educators characterize user responds to digital identity threats, and provides a scale for evaluating those responses.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-9378-2; Electronic:978-1-4673-9379-9; POD:978-1-4673-9380-5","10.1109/DIPDMWC.2016.7529395","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7529395","amygdala;assurance;authentication;authoritarianism;autonomy;behavior;characterization;communications;curriculum;cyber;digital;education;identity;information;infrastructure;irrational;judgement;motivation;reason;risk;security;society;strategy;training","Authentication;Brain modeling;Education;Information security","Internet;data privacy;message authentication;psychology;social aspects of automation","Internet;authentication technology;cyber identity;cyber security;digital identity;education;information security;institutional data usage;political science;psychology;societal attitude","","","","","","","","6-8 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important theory in financial markets is mean reversion, which plays a critical role in some state-of-the-art portfolio selection strategies. Although existing mean reversion strategies have been shown to achieve good empirical performance on certain datasets, they seldom carefully deal with noise and outliers in the data, leading to suboptimal portfolios, and consequently yielding poor performance in practice. In this paper, we propose to exploit the reversion phenomenon by using robust <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX""> $L_1$</tex-math><alternatives><inline-graphic xlink:type=""simple"" xlink:href=""huang-ieq1-2563433.gif""/></alternatives> </inline-formula>-median estimators, and design a novel online portfolio selection strategy named “Robust Median Reversion” (RMR), which constructs optimal portfolios based on the improved reversion estimator. We examine the performance of the proposed algorithms on various real markets with extensive experiments. Empirical results show that RMR can overcome the drawbacks of existing mean reversion algorithms and achieve significantly better results. Finally, RMR runs in linear time, and thus is suitable for large-scale real-time algorithmic trading applications.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2016.2563433","Key Projects of Fundamental Research Program of Shanghai Municipal Commission of Science and Technology; SEM; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Intelligent Information Processing; Singapore Ministry of Education Academic Research Fund; Special Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/100001314 - SRF for ROCS; 10.13039/100007219 - Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7465840","L1-median;Portfolio selection;mean reversion;online learning;robust median reversion","Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Estimation;Investment;Mathematical model;Portfolios;Robustness","","","","1","","","","","20160505","Sept. 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Some decentralized methods are more efficient in finding approximate solutions, but most are application dependent. By modeling AMSs as Petri nets, we develop an innovative distributed approach, which can create a trajectory leading to a desired goal and is adaptable to different kinds of applications. Control strategies are applied to processes locally such that they can proceed concurrently and efficiently. Global goals are always reachable through the local observation, control, and execution of processes without knowing external and extra information.

First, we summarize other studies and propose our method. Then, data are collected using the proposed system. From past games, games to similar to a target game are extracted depending on data from their first half. Next, similar games are classified by features depending on data of their second half. Finally, a target game is predicted and tactical ideas are derived. The practicability of the method is demonstrated through experiments.

Traditionally, universities have autonomous status and the right to carry out their self-chosen policy. The autonomy and independence of universities have formed the cornerstone of their existence. In recent years there is a rising interest in monitoring the effectiveness of academic institutions. On the one hand, this interest comes from the external desire to control the efficient use of financing and, on the other hand, from the internal desire of the university administration to direct their scant financing in a productive way. In this model, university funding is seen as an investment to implement both government and university strategies. The significance of free external financing has increased simultaneously, but even this funding is based on heavy competition between institutions. To summarize, a transition towards the entrepreneurship model has also begun in universities. Alongside academic freedom, a culture of the evaluation and measurement of quality has been created; in this process, academic values may be consigned to the background. The paper addresses the changes in universities caused by the measurement directed culture. Digitalization supports this process by providing automated tools for collecting data and using it for measurement. The handling of the topic is partially general, and partially draws on the experiences (context) of the authors. The transition towards openness and networked activities has begun. It remains to be seen what will happen to traditional academic values.","","CD-ROM:978-953-233-088-5; Electronic:978-953-233-086-1; POD:978-1-5090-2543-5","10.1109/MIPRO.2016.7522245","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7522245","","Bibliometrics;Context;Education;Industries;Measurement;Organizations","educational institutions;further education;law administration","academic institution;entrepreneurship model;free external financing;higher education;measurement-driven academia;university administration;university funding","","","","","","","","May 30 2016-June 3 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since users usually have to report their locations to the LBS providers while using services, the protection of user's location privacy poses a critical challenge. Although many existing approaches can preserve user's location privacy effectively, most of them must include and use the user's real location. In this paper, we first propose an efficient k-anonymity based Dummy Location and divided Circular Area (k-DLCA) approach to protect the user's location privacy. Different from existing studies, the k-DLCA algorithm adopts a greedy strategy to select dummy locations and considers the semantic location information of the location. Moreover, the user's real location may not be contained in the chosen dummy locations.

With the development of mobile Internet, there is an increasingly urgent need to optimize the DRX performance to accommodate the emerging applications. In this paper, to describe the self-similarity exhibited by the applications, a truncated-Pareto-distributed arrival traffic model is introduced into the LTE-DRX modeling framework. With this premise, a DRX analytical model based on a discrete-time semi-Markov process (DTSMP) is established. Using the proposed model, the performance of DRX operations under certain configurations can be evaluated precisely. To deploy it in practical use, we have designed an online power-saving strategy (OPSS) to improve the energy efficiency of the UE. The OPSS is conducted in two phases: estimation and optimization. In the first phase, several derived statistical estimators are deployed to capture the fluctuations of the traffic conditions and DRX operations. It is proved that these estimators could unbiasedly estimate the statistics within just 1 s. In the second phase, the DRX configuration is optimized by considering the trade off between the packet delay and the power-saving performance. Solid simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of the DRX analytical model and to evaluate the efficiency of the OPSS. The well-matched results demonstrate that the analytical model is correctly derived. Moreover, we have proved that the proposed OPSS could outperform the conventional LTE DRX mechanism in terms of both energy conservation and packet delay.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2014.2328232","U.S. National Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6824851","Discontinuous reception (DRX);Long-Term Evolution (LTE);discrete-time semi-Markov process (DTSMP);multimedia;power saving;self-similar traffic","Analytical models;Delays;Internet;Long Term Evolution;Mathematical model;Mobile communication;Multimedia communication","Long Term Evolution;Markov processes;Pareto optimisation;radio equipment;telecommunication traffic","DRX mechanism;DTSMP;LTE DRX mechanism;LTE discontinuous reception mechanism;LTE systems;LTE-DRX modeling framework;UE;battery lifetime;discrete-time semi-Markov process;energy conservation;long-term evolution;mobile Internet;online power-saving strategy;packet delay;self-similar traffic;truncated-Pareto-distributed arrival traffic model;user equipment","","3","","29","","","20140603","July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the examples collected directly by sampling are neither necessarily informative nor intended to be useful for classifier learning. Updating the classifier with these examples might introduce ambiguity to the tracker. In this paper, we present a novel online discriminative tracking framework that explicitly couples the objectives of example collection and classifier learning. Our method uses Laplacian regularized least squares (LapRLS) to learn a robust classifier that can sufficiently exploit unlabeled data and preserve the local geometrical structure of the feature space. To ensure the high classification confidence of the classifier, we propose an active example selection approach to automatically select the most informative examples for LapRLS. Part of the selected examples that satisfy strict constraints are labeled to enhance the adaptivity of our tracker, which actually provides robust supervisory information to guide semisupervised learning. With active example selection, we are able to avoid the ambiguity introduced by an independent example collection strategy and to alleviate the drift problem caused by misaligned examples. Comparison with the state-of-the-art trackers on the comprehensive benchmark demonstrates that our tracking algorithm is more effective and accurate.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2395791","973 Program of China; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Chinese Higher Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7147821","Active example selection;active learning;discriminative tracking;semisupervised learning","Labeling;Laplace equations;Optimization;Prediction algorithms;Robustness;Training;Visualization","image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;object tracking;optical tracking;target tracking","Laplacian regularized least square method;active example selection;classifier learning;on-line discriminative tracking;semisupervised learning","","0","","34","","","20150702","July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our results can be easily extended to other wireless mice using different radio links. We begin by presenting multiple ways to sniff unencrypted Bluetooth packets containing raw mouse movement data. We then show that such data may reveal text-based passwords entered by clicking on software keyboards. We propose two attacks, the prediction attack and replay attack, which can reconstruct the on-screen cursor trajectories from sniffed mouse movement data. Two inference strategies are used to discover passwords from cursor trajectories. We conducted a holistic study over all popular operating systems and analyzed how mouse acceleration algorithms and packet losses may affect the reconstruction results.

Our work consists mainly of three parts. The first part focuses on the analysis of CVD's mathematical properties. We characterize CVD's central tendency as the mirror-image distribution and provide mathematical formula for its probability density function. We also provide a closed formula for the relationship between CVD's vertices, chords, and faces, the average chord length, and the average edge number of a CVD polygon. And, the expressions for the average overall and local positioning error are also provided. Based upon these findings, we show that the convergence speed for a CVD based localization scheme is quadratic, and the optimal time and space complexities are Θ(n<sup>2</sup>) and Θ(n), respectively. The second part proposes a novel approach, called Polling, which utilizes the concept of the Error Region, to further improve the accuracy. Polling, in theory, enables us to make use of the topology information with the quantity up to O(n<sup>4</sup>) provided by CVD for localization, while a conventional CVD scheme can use only O(1) such information. The third part, through simulations, shows how to use the quasi Analog-to-Digital Conversion (qADC) strategy to handle signal errors. Combined with Polling and qADC, a CVD scheme can provide a simple, robust, and powerful solution to the wireless network localization.

To this end, we conducted an empirical study, where a lag sequential analysis was used to analyze behavior patterns while qualitative data from the questionnaire were applied to explain why these behavior patterns were happened. The results indicated students with a two-tier test tended to realize the rationale of a concept, instead of relying on their memories. In other words, the two-tier test can facilitate students to develop deep thinking skills.

In this way, the final gasoline product properties can be controlled quite well at one time, and the re-blending times of final product have been much reduced compared with the conventional single loop optimization method.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8075-1; POD:978-1-4673-8076-8","10.1109/ICIT.2016.7474821","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7474821","double loop;gasoline;online blending;optimization","Fluctuations;Oils;Optimization methods;Petroleum;Production;Standards","blending;optimisation;petroleum","direct-blending component oils;double loop optimization method;gasoline online blending;gasoline properties;optimization strategy;single loop optimization method","","","","10","","","","14-17 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To meet industry demand, many business schools offer academic courses in ERP strategy and technology to train students to be proficient in the use of ERP systems. The extant literature on ERP education highlights the need for additional research about pedagogical techniques that can help business schools in their efforts. To be effective in the delivery of ERP courses, instructors require a deeper understanding of how they can teach ERP systems in a meaningful way and consequently foster higher levels of student engagement. This paper provides an overview of the current state of ERP academic programs and teaching practices. This is followed by a review of experiential learning theory (ELT) which is later used in this paper as a basis for pedagogical practice suggestions towards the improvement of ERP training. A pedagogical model comprising of various course activities and teaching practices is proposed.

Recently, matrix factorization has achieved great success in cross-modal hashing. However, how to effectively use label information and local geometric structure is still a challenging problem for these approaches. To address this issue, we propose a cross-modal hashing method based on collective matrix factorization, which considers both the label consistency across different modalities and the local geometric consistency in each modality. These two elements are formulated as a graph Laplacian term in the objective function, leading to a substantial improvement on the discriminative power of latent semantic features obtained by collective matrix factorization. Moreover, the proposed method learns unified hash codes for different modalities of an instance to facilitate cross-modal search, and the objective function is solved using an iterative strategy. The experimental results on two benchmark data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2016.2564638","Key Projects of Outstanding Youth Talent Support Program of Anhui Provincial Universities; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100003995 - Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7466099","Cross-modal hashing;collective matrix factorization;cross-modal hashing;label consistency;local geometric consistency;multimedia retrieval","Image coding;Laplace equations;Linear programming;Manifolds;Multimedia communication;Semantics;Sparse matrices","computational complexity;geometry;graph theory;information retrieval;matrix decomposition","collective matrix factorization;cross-modal hashing;cross-modal retrieval;graph Laplacian;heterogeneous multimedia data;iterative strategy;label information;local geometric structure;low-dimensional Hamming space;supervised matrix factorization hashing","","4","","49","","","20160506","July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Different from the conventional battery-free PS relaying strategy, harvested energy is prioritized to power information relaying while the remainder is accumulated and stored for future usage with the help of a battery in the proposed strategy, which supports an efficient utilization of harvested energy. However, PS affects throughput at subsequent time slots due to the battery operations including the charging and discharging. To this end, PS and battery operations are coupled with distributed beamforming. A throughput optimization problem to incorporate these coupled operations is formulated though it is intractable. To address the intractability of the optimization, a layered optimization method is proposed to achieve the optimal joint PS and battery operation design with non-causal channel state information (CSI), in which the PS and the battery operation can be analyzed in a decomposed manner. Then, a general case with causal CSI is considered, where the proposed layered optimization method is extended by utilizing the statistical properties of CSI. To reach a better tradeoff between performance and complexity, a greedy method that requires no information about subsequent time slots is proposed. Simulation results reveal the upper and lower bound on performance of the proposed strategy, which are reached by the layered optimization method with non-causal CSI and the greedy method, respectively. Moreover, the proposed strategy outperforms the conventional PS-based relaying without energy accumulation and time switching-based relaying strategy.","0733-8716;07338716","","10.1109/JSAC.2016.2544559","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Basic Research Program of China; National High Technology Research and Development Program of China; U.S. Army Research Office; 10.13039/100000001 - National Science Foundation; 10.13039/100006754 - U.S. Army Research Laboratory; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7437403","Wireless-powered communication;channel state information;harvest-use-store;power splitting","Array signal processing;Batteries;Energy harvesting;Optimization;RF signals;Relays;Switches","array signal processing;cooperative communication;energy conservation;energy consumption;energy harvesting;relay networks (telecommunication);statistical analysis;telecommunication power management;wireless channels","causal CSI statistical properties;distributed beamforming;energy accumulation;greedy method;harvest-use-store PS relaying strategy;harvest-use-store power splitting relaying strategy;harvested energy utilization efficiency;layered optimization method;noncausal channel state information;optimal joint PS and battery operation design;throughput optimization problem;wireless-powered cooperative communication;wireless-powered multirelay cooperative network","","3","","27","","","20160321","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Pedagogical strategies in fields with an abundance of abstract concepts, such as physics or electrical engineering, additionally recommend experiential experience, such as laboratory experiments, as essential learning tools. To fulfill increased demand for engineers, additional educational opportunities have been created, which include online, remote and blended learning environments. Unfortunately, providing hands-on experience in these environments, which is as effective as in-class experiments in STEM fields, is extremely challenging. Different departments have developed online and remote solutions, from single remote introductory courses with online experiments to entire off-campus programs supported by remotely conducted experiments with mobile studios. However, in online situations, students often feel lost, have issues with the technology, and experience lack of engagement. All these factors can result in increased dropout rates or lack of understanding and commitment. Current trends in online education incline towards engaging students using gamification strategies to reduce dropout rates and to increase students' motivation in a playful way. Additionally, creating playful experiences for students can be used to attract novice students to this field. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework, which can be used to enhance online and mobile experiments with game design strategies to raise students' engagement and commitment and reduce initial onboarding obstacles.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7717-1; POD:978-1-4673-7718-8; USB:978-1-4673-7716-4","10.1109/EXPAT.2015.7463270","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7463270","game-based learning;gamification;mobile experimentation;mobile labs;online learning;remote learning","Computational modeling;Computers;Context;Games;Learning management systems;Mobile communication","Internet;STEM;computer aided instruction;computer games;educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;mobile computing;teaching","STEM education;gamification strategy;mobile experimentation;off-campus program;online education;online experimentation;pedagogical strategy;remote introductory course;science technology engineering and mathematics;teaching","","1","","28","","","","2-4 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The traditional static train trajectory planning methods are always designed offline according to a preplanned timetable, and they ignored the uncertainties of parameters, resulted by line condition, resistance coefficient, and delay. These uncertain disturbances have not been considered adequately in previous studies. This paper deals with the dynamic optimal train trajectory planning problem with uncertainties. First, in order to identify uncertain resistance coefficients and calculate the dynamic limited speed, we present the optimization framework using onboard equipment such as a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) terminal, a power supply system, and a communication device to sample the real-time traffic information. Then, by taking the energy consumption and punctuality as objectives, we propose a moving horizon train trajectory planning optimization model with an adaptive weight allocation mechanism based on trip time error. The innovation of this paper lies not only in the establishment of a novel dynamic optimization model for train trajectory planning but also the strategy that combines real-time traffic information with the trajectory planning procedure. By contrast with most existing solutions, the proposed approach fully takes advantage of the real-time information and thus avoids the difficulties for modeling the uncertain coefficients for train trajectory planning. The efficiency of the proposed approach is illustrated by showing some numerical results of simulations with the infrastructure data from Beijing-Shanghai High-speed Railway of China.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2015.2499254","Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project; National International Scientific and Technological Cooperation Project; National Key Technology R&D Program of China; State Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7348705","High-speed train;differential evolution;moving horizon optimization;optimal planning;train operation;trajectory","Energy consumption;Optimization;Planning;Rail transportation;Real-time systems;Resistance;Trajectory","optimisation;rail traffic control;railways;trajectory control;uncertain systems;velocity control","energy consumption;high-speed railway;high-speed train operation;moving horizon optimization;parameter uncertainty;train speed;trajectory planning;weight allocation mechanism","","1","","43","","","20151207","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To address this challenge, this paper proposes Enhanced CARP (E-CARP), which is an enhanced version of the channel-aware routing protocol (CARP) developed by S. Basagni et al., to achieve the location-free and greedy hop-by-hop packet forwarding strategy. In general, CARP does not consider the reusability of previously collected sensory data to support certain domain applications afterward, which induces data packets forwarding which may not be beneficial to applications. Besides, the PING-PONG strategy in CARP can be simplified for selecting the most appropriate relay node at each time point, when the network topology is relatively steady.

The camera, when active, may move and the appearance of both the background and the target may change abruptly, leading to the inadequacy of most standard tracking techniques. We propose to exploit a learning approach that considers the tracking task as a semisupervised learning problem. Given few target samples, the aim is to search for the target occurrences in the video stream, reinterpreting the problem as label propagation on a similarity graph. We propose a solution based on graph transduction that iteratively works frame by frame. In addition, to avoid drifting, we introduce an update strategy based on an evolutionary clustering technique that chooses the visual templates that better describe target appearance, evolving the model during the processing of the video. Since we model people's appearance by means of covariance matrices on color and gradient information, our framework is directly related to structure learning on Riemannian manifolds. Tests on publicly available data sets and comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques allow us to conclude that our solution exhibits interesting performances in terms of tracking precision and recall in most of the considered scenarios.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2416555","National Technological Cluster on Smart Communities through the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7067436","People Tracking;People tracking;Transductive Learning;Videosurveillance;transductive learning (TL);video surveillance","Covariance matrices;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Image color analysis;Manifolds;Surveillance;Target tracking","covariance matrices;gradient methods;image sensors;learning (artificial intelligence);object tracking;video streaming;video surveillance","Riemannian manifolds;camera;constant elements;covariance matrices;evolutionary clustering technique;gradient information;graph transduction;learning approach;long term tracking;semisupervised learning problem;similarity graph;standard tracking techniques;structure learning;transductive people tracking;unconstrained surveillance;video stream;visual templates","","1","","62","","","20150325","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Learning pattern data analysis derives conclusions using decision trees. Through this process, information can be extracted from students' affective responses and students' profile data and relevant correlations between the two data sets can be recognized automatically. A personalized learning component uses this information to offer proactive support to students. This is achieved by recommending personalized courses of action which are beneficial to students.

The main reason is the services and sources provided the users by the clouds. In order to avoid over interactions of the servers and given the work volume and green computations, load balancing in cloud computing is of enormous importance requiring dynamic load distribution in a proportionate manner among the servers. Load balancing may reduce the used energy through avoiding over interaction between the nodes and virtual machines providing desired resource utilization. When a system fails, high costs are imposed on both server and customer, thus load balancing algorithm needs good fault tolerance. There are various techniques to increase fault tolerance. In this study task replication technique was used. To do so three fuzzy inference engines with an approach to fault tolerance for tasks prioritization, virtual prioritization and virtual machines as a goal for task replication were designed. Fuzzy method was selected because the question environment is uncertain and the parameters determination which is carried out by fuzzy method. In the proposed procedure by tasks and virtual priority, we could provide a proper work load distribution. The aim of this study was to present a novel strategy to improve load balancing for increasing fault tolerance and reducing energy consumption via ranking the tasks and virtual machines in cloud computing by fuzzy method.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6506-2; POD:978-1-4673-6507-9","10.1109/KBEI.2015.7436178","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7436178","Cloud computing;Energy consumption;Fuzzy method;fault tolerance;load balancing","Decision support systems;Engines;Fuzzy logic;Handheld computers;Pragmatics;Reliability;Virtual machining","cloud computing;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;resource allocation;software fault tolerance","cloud computing;dynamic load distribution;energy consumption;fault tolerance;fuzzy inference engines;fuzzy method;load balancing algorithm;task replication technique;tasks prioritization;virtual machines;virtual prioritization","","1","","22","","","","5-6 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on Knapsack Problem 14 benchmark functions, and simulation results show that LSCQEA has the similar performance but simpler complexity compared with other algorithms.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-8301-1; Electronic:978-1-4673-8302-8; POD:978-1-4673-8303-5","10.1109/ITME.2015.60","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7429157","L5-based neigh-bors;cellular structure;quantum evolutionary algorithm","Benchmark testing;Evolutionary computation;Genetics;Lattices;Quantum computing;Sociology;Statistics","evolutionary computation;knapsack problems;quantum computing","CQEA;L5-based synchronous cellular quantum evolutionary algorithm;knapsack problem","","","","12","","","","13-15 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our method can be viewed as an enhanced version of the bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) in solving multi-objective optimization (MOO) problems (MOPs). We first propose a task-oriented optimization framework and model, and then parallel cell entropy and its difference are introduced to evaluate the evolutionary status of the Pareto solutions in a new objective space called parallel cell coordinate system (PCCS). In particular, the Pareto-archived evolution approach (PAEA) and the adaptive foraging strategy (AFS) are applied to balance the convergence and diversity of the Pareto front in the optimization procedure. Compared with traditional approaches, MOBFO not only increases speed of convergence toward the Pareto front, but also improves the diversity of the obtained solutions.

A backlash-like hysteresis is modeled as a nonsmooth function with multivalued mapping; the corresponding objective function of the control system is also defined as being nonsmooth. In this case, the implementation of conventional model predictive control for such systems will encounter a challenge, since the gradients of the control criterion function with respect to control variables do not exist at nonsmooth points. In order to solve this problem, a nonsmooth receding horizon strategy based on Clarke subgradients is proposed.

This question is relevant in physics for the study of correlations and plays an important role in computer science in the context of complexity and cryptography. In this paper, the case of multiplayer non-signaling games is considered, i.e., the only restriction on the players is that they are not allowed to communicate during the game. For complete-support games (games where all possible combinations of questions have non-zero probability to be asked) with any number of players, we prove a threshold theorem stating that the probability that non-signaling players win more than a fraction 1-α+β of the n games is exponentially small in nβ<sup>2</sup> for every 0 ≤ β ≤ α. For games with incomplete support, we derive a similar statement for a slightly modified form of repetition. The result is proved using a new technique based on a recent de Finetti theorem, which allows us to avoid central technical difficulties that arise in standard proofs of parallel repetition theorems.","0018-9448;00189448","","10.1109/TIT.2016.2516022","CHIST-ERA Project DIQIP; European Commission Strategic Targeted Research Project RAQUEL; Ministry of Education, Singapore, under the Tier 3; Perimeter Institute, Waterloo, ON, Canada; Simons Institute, Berkeley, CA, USA; Swiss National Science Foundation via the National Centre of Competence in Research through the QSIT Project; 10.13039/501100000781 - European Research Council; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7377091","Parallel repetition;correlations;de Finetti theorems;multiplayer games;non-locality;non-signalling players;probability theory;quantum entanglement;threshold theorem","Complexity theory;Computer science;Context;Correlation;Games;Quantum mechanics","game theory","complete-support games;computer science;cryptography;de Finetti reductions;multiplayer nonsignaling games;non-zero probability;nonsignaling parallel repetition;optimal winning probability;physics;threshold theorem","","","","39","","OAPA","20160108","March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Benefiting from the use of the local Rademacher complexity, our algorithm, therefore, has a sharper generalization error bound. Compared with methods that minimize over all singular values, concentrating on the tail singular values results in better recovery of the low-rank structure of the multi-label predictor, which plays an important role in exploiting label correlations. We propose a new conditional singular value thresholding algorithm to solve the resulting objective function. Moreover, a variance control strategy is employed to reduce the variance of variables in optimization.

Sci. & Technol. Univ., Beijing, China","IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","20160114","2016","65","1","266","277","Delay-tolerant networks (DTNs) rely on the mobility of nodes and their contacts to make up with the lack of continuous connectivity and, thus, enable message delivery from source to destination in a “store-carry-forward” fashion. Since message delivery consumes resource such as storage and power, some nodes may choose not to forward or carry others' messages while relying on others to deliver their locally generated messages. These kinds of selfish behaviors may hinder effective communications over DTNs. In this paper, we present an efficient incentive-compatible (IC) routing protocol (ICRP) with multiple copies for two-hop DTNs based on the algorithmic game theory. It takes both the encounter probability and transmission cost into consideration to deal with the misbehaviors of selfish nodes. Moreover, we employ the optimal sequential stopping rule and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction as a strategy to select optimal relay nodes to ensure that nodes that honestly report their encounter probability and transmission cost can maximize their rewards. We attempt to find the optimal stopping time threshold adaptively based on realistic probability model and propose an algorithm to calculate the threshold. Based on this threshold, we propose a new method to select relay nodes for multicopy transmissions. To ensure that the selected relay nodes can receive their rewards securely, we develop a signature scheme based on a bilinear map to prevent the malicious nodes from tampering. Through simulations, we demonstrate that ICRP can effectively stimulate nodes to forward/carry messages and achieve higher packet delivery ratio with lower transmission cost.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2015.2454291","Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project; Beijing Key Laboratory of Internet Culture and Digital Dissemination Research; Open Project of State Key Laboratory of Information Security; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7152962","Delay tolerant networks (DTNs);Delay-tolerant networks (DTNs);Optimal sequential stopping rule;Routing protocol;incentive compatibility;optimal sequential stopping rule;routing protocol","Algorithm design and analysis;Delays;Nickel;Online banking;Relays;Routing protocols","delay tolerant networks;game theory;probability;relay networks (telecommunication);routing protocols","ICRP;VCG auction;Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction;algorithmic game theory;bilinear map;incentive-compatible routing protocol;nodes mobility;optimal relay node;packet delivery ratio;realistic probability model;stopping time threshold;store-carry-forward;two-hop DTN;two-hop delay-tolerant network","","3","","37","","","20150708","Jan. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Initial policy structure includes no information about processor load but as the task groups arrive and get scheduled, this information acts as a prerequisite for next allocation. The task of load stability is tricky when static scheduling strategies are followed in allocation because these strategies require supplementary efforts to balance the load as the approaches designed so far do not follow load stability criteria during task allocation; rather they follow task adjustment to balance the load later on that enriches the overhead of context switching of tasks among processors. Context switching efforts not only includes the efforts for changing process address space, but position in ready queue is also affected. The work projected in this desertion performs load stability with priori information about processor utilization, based on this metric value processor space is partitioned among different categories. Depending on the load status, processors are categorized and an appropriate set out of those is identified that act as buddy for others and handles incoming queue. In other words stress free “buddy set” handles incoming job queue in place of their “stress underneath buddy set” processors so as to eliminate the pains of context switching and tasks adjustments after the tasks allocation.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6747-9; POD:978-1-4673-6748-6; USB:978-1-4673-6746-2","10.1109/MITE.2015.7375298","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7375298","job scheduling strategy;load stability;parallel environment;stress estimation","Context;Load management;Processor scheduling;Program processors;Resource management;Stability criteria;Switches","estimation theory;parallel processing;processor scheduling;task analysis","buddy strategy;context switching;load stability criteria;parallel stress estimation;policy structure;stable task assignment;static scheduling strategies;task allocation;task scheduling","","","","17","","","","1-2 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Generally there are two methods of taking attendance in a classroom- calling out students name one by one or taking students signature on paper. However each of those strategies are time consuming, inefficient and moreover proxy can be easily given by students if strength of class is large since it is not possible to verify each student in person. A good amount of the time is wasted in taking attendance and even then many times attendance don't seem to be marked properly. Proxy of students in classroom is a perpetual problem that has to be addressed. Therefore an attendance management system is required which not only authenticates the student but also detect proxies. In this paper we combine privacy preservation and collusion resistance to propose an attendance system which uses an android application to mark student's attendance in the classroom and detect proxies given by students. It exploits the Bluetooth technology to ensure student is present in class itself rather than in the canteen or in the library. Based on the attendance given by students, a trust factor is assigned to each student to determine how trustworthy a student is.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6747-9; POD:978-1-4673-6748-6; USB:978-1-4673-6746-2","10.1109/MITE.2015.7375285","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7375285","Bluetooth Scanning;Collusion Avoidance;Privacy;Trust Factor","Bluetooth;Databases;Fingerprint recognition;Organizations;Privacy;Servers;Smart phones","Bluetooth;data privacy;educational institutions","Bluetooth technology;android application;collusion resistance attendance management system;perpetual problem;privacy preservation;student attendance marking;student authentication;student proxy detection;student trustworthiness;trust factor","","","","10","","","","1-2 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that the formulated mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem can be decomposed into two subproblems: 1) SP1 for the optimal spectrum sensing strategy and 2) SP2 for the optimal channel assignment and power allocation, without sacrificing optimality. We show that SP1 can be optimally solved if there is no restriction on the sensing capability for each CU, and develop a column generation (CG)-based algorithm to solve SP2 iteratively in a distributed manner. We also develop a heuristic algorithm for spectrum sensing with greatly reduced requirement on CU hardware, while still achieving a highly competitive sensing performance.

Based on this analysis, a road slope aided position estimation algorithm is presented, which includes a vehicle motion model that can compensate for the effect of the road slope. This algorithm can estimate the position and road slope simultaneously. Furthermore, by compensating for the error due to the road slope, the algorithm can improve the position estimation accuracy and reliability. The estimation algorithm in this paper is implemented and evaluated using automotive onboard sensors and embedded system; therefore, additional motion sensors and high-performance computational units are not necessary.

The temperature compensation of the workpiece is realized by establishing an air heat conduction model. Moreover, an intelligent PID decoupling control system based on a novel self-growing radial basis function neural network (SGRBFNN) is developed to eliminate the strong coupling effects of multiheating zones. SGRBFNN, with the structure being dynamically adjusted by a hybrid semifuzzy Gustafson-Kessel clustering algorithm, is proposed to realize the online tuning of the parameters of the PID controller. Both the simulation and industrial experiment results demonstrate that the proposed temperature control system can effectively achieve smooth regulations and significantly improve temperature uniformity.

Although there have been many studies on this, most of the analysis were limited to fixed authority and its effect on stability. None of the research has discussed how to allocate the control authority in real-time. This paper presents a dynamic authority distribution method for dual master single slave Cooperative Teleoperation systems, which allocates the authority over slave to operators on the move in each DOF separately. This method observes the energy interaction in the kinesthetic coupling link between the operators, classifies the interaction into operators' leader/follower behavior and adapts the authorities accordingly. The proposed method is experimentally tested with unique set of camera views of task environment with 3DOF dual master single slave teleoperation system. Experimental results demonstrate accurate convergence of decomposition of authorities based on camera-view. The performance of proposed dynamic authority architecture is evaluated by comparing total energy generation with fixed authority setup, and is found to be more efficient in terms of less energy generation, and hence less effort is required by operators to execute the task.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9994-1; POD:978-1-4799-9995-8; USB:978-1-4799-9993-4","10.1109/IROS.2015.7354113","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7354113","","Cameras;Couplings;Force;Robots;Stability analysis;Training;Visualization","cameras;convergence;robot vision;stability;telerobotics","3-DOF dual-master single-slave cooperative teleoperation systems;authority decomposition convergence;camera views;camera-view;control authority;dynamic authority distribution method;energy generation;energy interaction;kinesthetic coupling link;leader-follower behavior;slave robot;stability;total energy generation","","","","13","","","","Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For object detection, humans and computer-vision-based systems employ different strategies to locate targets, likely providing complementary information. However, little effort has been made in combining the outputs of multiple autonomous detectors and multiple human-generated responses. This paper presents a method for integrating several sources of human- and autonomy-generated information for rapid object detection tasks. Human electroencephalography (EEG) and button-press responses from rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) experiments are fused with outputs from trained object detection algorithms. Three fusion methods-Bayesian, Dempster-Shafer, and Dynamic Dempster-Shafer-are implemented for comparison. Results demonstrate that fusion of these human classifiers with computer-vision-based detectors improves object detection accuracy over purely computer-vision-based detection (5% relative increase in mean average precision) and the best individual computer vision algorithm (28% relative increase in mean average precision). Computer vision fused with button press response and/or the XDAWN + Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis neural classifier provides considerable improvement, while computer vision fused with other neural classifiers provides little or no improvement. Of the three fusion methods, Dynamic Dempster-Shafer Theory (DDST) Fusion exhibits the greatest performance in this application.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9994-1; POD:978-1-4799-9995-8; USB:978-1-4799-9993-4","10.1109/IROS.2015.7353390","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7353390","","Computer vision;Detectors;Electroencephalography;Heuristic algorithms;Object detection;Presses;Training","Bayes methods;computer vision;electroencephalography;image classification;inference mechanisms;medical image processing;object detection;sensor fusion","Bayesian fusion methods;Bayesian linear discriminant analysis;DDST fusion;EEG;RSVP;XDAWN;autonomy-generated information;button press response;button-press responses;collaborative control;computer-vision-based detectors;dynamic Dempster-Shafer theory fusion;human classifiers;human electroencephalography;human-autonomy sensor fusion;human-generated information;mean average precision;neural classifier;object recognition;prosthetics;rapid object detection tasks;rapid serial visual presentation;surveillance","","2","","31","","","","Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clustering analysis is an active area of machine learning and a fundamental technique of information granulation. By using different clustering algorithms and different parameters of an algorithm, a data set can be granulated into multiple granular spaces. Clustering ensemble with these granular spaces is an effective strategy of multigranulation information fusion. The existing algorithms of clustering ensemble can be categorized into three types: feature-based method, combinatorial method and graph-based method. Given the fact that every type of methods has their own advantages and disadvantages, combining their advantages will obtain better granulation results. Based on this consideration, this paper introduces a Dempster-Shafer evidence theory based clustering ensemble method that combines advantages of combinatorial method and graph-based method. In this strategy, the definition of mass functions considers neighbors of an object using the graph binarization and the final clustering ensemble result is generated by applying the Dempster's combination rule. The form of the Dempster's combination rule makes the algorithm conforming to the pattern of combinatorial method. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields better performance in comparison with other seven clustering ensemble methods conducted on fourteen numerical real-world data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7220-6; Electronic:978-1-4673-7221-3; POD:978-1-4673-7222-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2015.7340898","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7340898","Clustering ensemble;Dempster-Shafer evidence theory;Information fusion;Multigranulation","","graph theory;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;sensor fusion","Dempster-Shafer evidence theory;clustering analysis;clustering ensemble method;combinatorial method;feature-based method;graph binarization;graph-based method;human cognitive ability;information granulation;machine learning;multigranulation information fusion","","","","15","","","","12-15 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The presence of a few shortcut direct links transforms a regular network to a small world network resulting in achieving properties of high clustering coefficient and low average path length. In this paper, we propose a delay-optimized small world model for base station caching network to reduce the average network delay by decreasing multi-hop distance. In particular, we first study the degree-based and closeness-centrality shortcut addition strategies. To enhance these two strategies, we propose the delay-optimized shortcut addition strategy to decrease average network delay. The numerical results show that the proposed delay-optimized small world model can reduce the average network delay under remaining the clustering coefficient. Meanwhile, the average network delay with the proposal is 31.26% lower than that with the degree-based strategy, and is 18.78% lower than that with the closeness-centrality strategy.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6782-0; POD:978-1-4673-6783-7","10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343526","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7343526","Base station caching;average network delay;clustering coefficient;small world","Artificial neural networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Transforms;Wireless networks","cellular radio;delays;quality of service","advanced cellular networks;average network delay reduction;average path length;closeness-centrality shortcut addition strategy;clustering coefficient;degree-based strategy;delay-optimized shortcut addition strategy;delay-optimized small-world model;distributed base station caching;multihop distance;multihop transmission;network traffic load reduction;quality of service;shortcut direct links","","","","10","","","","Aug. 30 2015-Sept. 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Designed to replace TCP/IP using named data, Named Data Networking (NDN) has natural advantages to greatly overcome those challenges because of its multi-source and in-network caching characteristics. However, in the wireless environment the Interest and Data, proposed in NDN, are usually flooded because of the absence of Forwarding Information Base (FIB). To tackle this problem, we propose HVNDN, a hybrid forwarding strategy through NDN. More specifically, HVNDN introduces opportunistic and probabilistic forwarding strategy for location-dependent and location-independent information, respectively, which takes full advantage of geographic information and the characteristics of named data in VANETs. To make Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication more effective and reliable, we design elaborate Interest and Data packets formats, retransmission and acknowledgement mechanism in HVNDN. Simulation results from NS-3 demonstrate that the proposed forwarding strategy outperforms the state-of-art scheme with less end-to-end delay and overhead.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6782-0; POD:978-1-4673-6783-7","10.1109/PIMRC.2015.7343616","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7343616","","Delays;Land mobile radio;Large Hadron Collider;Mobile computing;Vehicles;Wireless communication","telecommunication network topology;vehicular ad hoc networks","HVNDN;TCP/IP;VANET;forwarding information base;hybrid information forwarding;location-dependent information;location-independent information;named data networking;opportunistic forwarding strategy;probabilistic forwarding strategy;vehicle-to-vehicle communication;vehicular ad hoc networks","","1","","12","","","","Aug. 30 2015-Sept. 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the existing methods for predicting the hidden behavior, a lot of testing data (usually quantitative information) are needed to be sampled. However, some complex engineering systems have the following characteristics: 1) The systems cannot be tested periodically, and the observable information is incomplete; 2) the change process of hidden behavior may be affected by the test; and 3) only part of quantitative information and qualitative knowledge (i.e., semiquantitative information) may be obtained. These characteristics all related to the test are named as testing influence for simplicity. Although a model and a corresponding optimal algorithm for training the model parameters have been proposed to predict the hidden behavior on the basis of semiquantitative information and belief rule base (BRB), the testing influence has not been considered. In order to solve the above problems, a new BRB-based model, which can use the semiquantitative information, is proposed under testing influence in this paper. In the newly proposed forecasting model, there are some parameters of which the initial values are usually assigned by experts and may not be accurate, which can lead to the inaccurate prediction results. As such, an improved optimal algorithm for training the parameters of the forecasting model is further developed on the basis of the expectation-maximization idea and the covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy (CMA-ES). By using the semiquantitative information, the proposed BRB-based model and the improved CMA-ES algorithm can operate together in an integrated manner so as to improve the forecasting precision.

The sensor system is composed of onboard motion sensors, a low-cost GPS receiver, a precise digital map, and multiple cameras. Data from the onboard motion sensors, such as yaw rate and wheel speeds, are used to predict the vehicle motion, and the GPS receiver is applied to establish the validation boundary of the ego-vehicle position. The digital map contains location information at the centimeter level about road surface markers (RSMs), such as lane markers, stop lines, and traffic sign markers. The multiple images from the front and rear mono-cameras and the around-view monitoring system are used to detect the RSM features. The localization algorithm updates the measurements by matching the RSM features from the cameras to the digital map based on a particle filter. Because the particle filter updates the measurements based on a probabilistic sensor model, the exact probabilistic modeling of sensor noise is a key factor to enhance the localization performance. To design the probabilistic noise model of the RSM features more explicitly, we analyze the results of the RSM feature detection for various real driving conditions. The proposed localization algorithm is verified and evaluated through experiments under various test scenarios and configurations. From the experimental results, we conclude that the presented localization algorithm based on the probabilistic noise model of RSM features provides sufficient accuracy and reliability for autonomous driving system applications.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2015.2450738","BK21; Industrial Strategy Technology Development Program of MKE; Korean government (MEST); 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education, Republic of Korea; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160754","Precise localization;autonomous car;autonomous driving;multiple cameras;particle filtering;probabilistic noise model of road surface marker (RSM) features;probabilistic noise modeling;road surface marker","Autonomous automobiles;Cameras;Feature extraction;Monte Carlo methods;Noise;Particle filters;Probabilistic logic;Sensor systems","Monte Carlo methods;cameras;cartography;feature extraction;image matching;image motion analysis;object detection;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","Global Positioning System;Monte Carlo localization algorithm;RSM feature detection;autonomous car localization;cameras;digital map;feature matching;lane markers;localization algorithm;low-cost GPS receiver;onboard motion sensors;probabilistic noise models;probabilistic sensor model;road surface marker features;stop lines;traffic sign markers;vehicle motion prediction","","2","","39","","","20150716","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We conducted an official survey of all the policymakers and stakeholders, who are engaged in consulting, developing, implementing, promoting, and using the e-Gov programs in Pakistan. The empirical results indicate that the CSFs main-categories: Governance, Management, and Resources are relatively more important than the Socio-Economics. Further, the CSFs sub-categories: Political, Managerial, Legislative, Non-Technical, and Technical are relatively more important than Social, Economic, and Scope. Finally, the CSFs: Political Stability, Managerial Strategy, ICT Policies, Funding, Portal Technology, Education & Skills, Cost, and Autonomy are the most important factors to achieve their respective CSFs sub-categories, which ultimately affect the e-Gov success in Pakistan.

The proposed controller design aims to guarantee vehicle stability while tracking the desired yaw rate, in spite of random network-induced delays that exist in both the feedback and forward channels. By modeling the random network-induced delays in both channels as two homogenous Markov chains, statistic information of these delays is incorporated in the mode-dependent tracking controller design. The control law consists of state feedback control and integral control. To fully compensate for the network-induced delays, a delay-free stochastic closed-loop system is first obtained in a discrete-time framework by using a system augmentation technique. Then, a robust linear quadratic regulator-based $\boldsymbol{H}_{\infty}$ controller is developed to achieve the tradeoff between the tracking error and the control input while also attenuating the effect of external disturbance. Considering the physical limitation of in-wheel motors, the eigenvalue positions of the state matrix are constrained in a predefined area to further balance the control inputs and transient responses by using pole placement. Finally, an iterative linear matrix inequality algorithm is adopted to obtain the delay-dependent feedback control gains. Simulation results based on a high-fidelity, CarSim, full-vehicle model show the effectiveness of the proposed lateral motion control approach.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2014.2383402","Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission; National Science Foundation of China; Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar) at Shanghai Institutions of Higher Learning; 10.13039/501100004543 - China Scholarship Council; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6990626","$\boldsymbol{H}_{\infty}$ control;FWIA electric vehicles;Four-wheel independently actuated (FWIA) electric vehicles;H∞ control;Lateral motion control;Markov chains;lateral motion control;network-induced delays","Closed loop systems;Delays;Electric vehicles;Materials;Motion control","H<sup>∞</sup> control;Markov processes;closed loop systems;control system synthesis;controller area networks;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;electric vehicles;iterative methods;linear matrix inequalities;linear quadratic control;motion control;pole assignment;state feedback;stochastic systems","controller area network;delay-dependent feedback control gain;delay-free stochastic closed-loop system;discrete-time framework;feedback forward channel;four-wheel independently actuated electric ground vehicles;homogenous Markov chain;integral control;iterative linear matrix inequality algorithm;mode dependent tracking controller design;random network-induced delay;robust lateral motion control strategy;robust linear quadratic regulator-based H<sub>∞</sub> controller;state feedback control;state matrix eigenvalue position;system augmentation technique;vehicle stability","","5","","42","","","20141218","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Online learning can be more flexible and often involves more technologies that can give learners the opportunity to interact with instructors and other learners effectively and flexibly. Recent studies indicate that university students who have been enrolled on e-learning courses outperform those being taught on traditional courses. An example of this can be found at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in America where student exam results have shown improvement as a result of e-learning techniques.

In this paper, an automatic control strategy is suggested to alleviate these problems thereby increasing the patient's safety and the overall quality of the therapy. The automatic controller presented in this paper is designed for our newly developed intelligent external ventricular drainage system. The proposed controller has to guarantee robustness and performance in face of uncertain patient intracranial dynamics and nonlinearities associated with the actuator. The controller is thus designed to guarantee robust performance using a mixed uncertainty modeling approach and extended by a self-scheduling approach to compensate for input nonlinearities.

The motion of the wheeled mobile robot can be observed using an uncalibrated fixed camera on the ceiling. Different from traditional vision-based control strategies of wheeled mobile robots in the fixed camera configuration, the camera image plane is not required to be parallel to the motion plane of the wheeled mobile robots and the camera can be placed at a general position. To guarantee that the wheeled mobile robot can efficiently track its desired trajectory, which is specified by the desired image trajectory of a feature point at the forward axis of the wheeled mobile robot, we will propose a new adaptive image-based trajectory tracking control approach without the exact knowledge of the camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and the position parameter of the feature point. To eliminate the nonlinear dependence on the unknown parameters from the closed-loop system, a depth-independent image Jacobian matrix framework for the wheeled mobile robots will be developed such that unknown parameters in the closed-loop system can be linearly parameterized. In this way, adaptive laws can be designed to estimate the unknown parameters online, and the depth information of the feature point can be allowed to be time varying in this case. The Lyapunov stability analysis will also be performed to show asymptotical convergence of image position and velocity tracking errors of the wheeled mobile robot. The simulation results based on a two-wheeled mobile robot will be given in this paper to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach as well.

In order to obtain a robust metric for matching, metric learning has been introduced recently. Most existing works focus on seeking a Mahalanobis distance by employing sparse pairwise constraints, which utilize image pairs with the same person identity as positive samples, and select a small portion of those with different identities as negative samples. However, this training strategy has abandoned a large amount of discriminative information, and ignored the relative similarities. In this paper, we propose a novel relevance metric learning method with listwise constraints (RMLLCs) by adopting listwise similarities, which consist of the similarity list of each image with respect to all remaining images. By virtue of listwise similarities, RMLLC could capture all pairwise similarities, and consequently learn a more discriminative metric by enforcing the metric to conserve predefined similarity lists in a low-dimensional projection subspace. Despite the performance enhancement, RMLLC using predefined similarity lists fails to capture the relative relevance information, which is often unavailable in practice. To address this problem, we further introduce a rectification term to automatically exploit the relative similarities, and develop an efficient alternating iterative algorithm to jointly learn the optimal metric and the rectification term. Extensive experiments on four publicly available benchmarking data sets are carried out and demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art approaches. The results also show that the introduction of the rectification term could further boost the performance of RMLLC.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2015.2466117","Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project; Beijing Natural Science Foundation; Foundation for Innovative Research Groups through the National Natural Science Foundation of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China; 10.13039/501100004602 - Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7182350","Person re-identification;alternating iterative optimization;list-wise similarities;metric learning","Cameras;Learning systems;Lighting;Measurement;Probes;Robustness;Training","learning (artificial intelligence)","RMLLC;listwise similarities;person re-identification;relevance metric learning;sparse pairwise constraints;video surveillance","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biometric Identification;Humans;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Video Recording","15","","65","","","20150807","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Currently, there are three recommendation strategies: content-based recommender strategy, collaborative filtering recommender strategy, and hybrid strategy. Since characterized as simple, easy to implement, and with high accuracy, collaborative filtering recommender algorithm is widely used. But typical problems still exist in traditional collaborative filtering algorithms, for example, data sparsity, cold start, easy to be attack, and poor ability for migration of user preference, etc, which lead to decreasing of recommendation accuracy and decline of user confidence for recommendation system. In this paper, a novel personalized recommendation strategy is proposed based on traditional collaborative filtering technology, aimed at the issues of poor interest migration and easy to be attack. We call it trusted social network community based recommendation strategy Trusted communities in which users all with similar preference are been detected from user social network. And then recommendation is been given based on these trusted communities. Nodes in the trusted community all have trust relationship between them, so it can effectively avoid attacks from malicious nodes. Meanwhile, a mechanism used for trust relationship feedback has been introduced. Users can submit some feedbacks for their trust relationship after every transaction, which means while the quality of item they received surpass their expectation, they could enhance the relationship, and while fall behind their expectation, they can weaken the relationship. This mechanism provide a good approach to solve change of preference. Experiments show that the algorithm can effectively improve the accuracy of recommendation, and enhance customer satisfaction.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6600-4; POD:978-1-4799-6601-1; USB:978-1-4799-6599-1","10.1109/ICCSE.2015.7250297","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7250297","Collaborative Filtering;Community Detection;Preference Migration;attack;trust relationship","Accuracy;Collaboration;Compounds;Presses;Recommender systems;Social network services","collaborative filtering;electronic commerce;recommender systems;security of data;social networking (online)","collaborative filtering recommender strategy;content-based recommender strategy;e-commerce;hybrid strategy;personalized recommendation strategy;trusted social community;user social network","","1","","14","","","","22-24 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ensemble learning is an effective strategy to significantly improve the generalization ability of machine learning systems. The objective of this work is to develop a method of fusing monotonic decision trees. In order to achieve this goal, we take two factors into account: attribute reduction and fusing principle. Through introducing variable dominance rough sets, we firstly propose an attribute reduction approach with rank-preservation for learning base classifiers, which can effectively avoid overfitting and improve classification performance. Then, we establish a fusing principe based on maximal probability through combining the base classifiers, which is used to further improve generalization ability of the learning system.

These results show that the MPM will become a useful tool for clinicians to determine whether neoadjuvant therapy is effective or treatment strategy is approximate, and this study may provide the groundwork for further exploration into the application of MPM in a clinical setting.","1077-260X;1077260X","","10.1109/JSTQE.2015.2456108","National Clinical Key Specialty Construction Project (General Surgery); Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Fujian Province; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University; Youth Scientific Research Foundation of Fujian Provincial Department of Health (2013-2-36); 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7156054","Multiphoton microscopy;neoadjuvant treatment;rectal carcinoma;second harmonic generation (SHG);two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF)","Biomedical imaging;Cancer;Indexes;Medical treatment;Microscopy;Tumors","biomedical optical imaging;blood vessels;cancer;drugs;optical harmonic generation;optical microscopy;proteins;radiation therapy;tumours;two-photon spectra","MPM;SHG;TPEF;biological exploration;blood vessel hyperplasia;collagen orientation index;colloid response;inflammatory reaction;intensity ratio;multiphoton microscopy;neoadjuvant therapy;nonlinear optical imaging;nonlinear optical microscopy;normal tissue;optical biomarkers;post-therapeutic cancerous tissues;pre-therapeutic cancerous tissues;rectal carcinoma;residual tumors;second harmonic generation;stromal fibrosis;tumor response visualization;two-photon excited fluorescence","","1","","30","","","20150714","May-June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Higher education institutes have to spend more on hardware and software purchasing, maintenance, upgrading and licensing. Cloud computing emerged as an Internet based solution, whereby computing resources are provided to consumers and organizations as services on demand on pay per use bases. Cloud computing provides higher education information delivery, communication and collaboration. It enables the education organizations to scale their IT infrastructure while reducing the administrative burden.

To motivate the students' interest had provided good results to engage students in the contents of our course. In particular, we suggest them to build their own complete embedded system, which structure and purpose is completely decided by the students. This freedom makes the students be stimulated, interested and enjoy, moving them to find the solutions they require in learning material. In this way, students feel that knowledge to acquire in the course is useful instead of just something boring to learn for an exam, but at the same time the use of that material allows them to internalize it and get new skills. But also, once the project finish makes students feel self-confident to face engineering challenges that they may find in future work. During the last years, the students achieved design and debugging skills on VHDL by facing the challenges from their own proposed system. Commonly, students go deeper in the areas when they feel interested than when teachers request them. It is because students find the relevance of the knowledge when it provide solutions to them. Also, this motivation moves students to spend more hours in the project than they use to spend in other subjects. In fact, students even decide to buy FPGA training boards to keep working at home (prices start from 36$). The elements developed by the students in their embedded systems, use to be the hardware controller for PS/2 keyboard and mouse, graphic controller, music generator with or without digital to analog converters, access to different memory mod- les.

The fundamental properties of such hybrid systems, however, have not been thoroughly investigated. This paper studies the hybrid cognitive Gaussian relay channel (HCGRC), which uses licensed radio resource (RR) and cognitive/unlicensed RR for forward and relay transmissions, respectively. HCGRC fundamentally differs from conventional relay channels in that the licensed and cognitive RRs are not subject to a total resource constraint and that the cognitive RR is opportunistic in nature. With respect to both the upper and lower bounds, we derive the optimal power-bandwidth allocation strategies for the cognitive relay to maximize the capacity, spectrum efficiency (SE), and energy efficiency (EE). The Pareto-optimal EE-SE tradeoff curve is also derived analytically. Our study leads to two key observations. First, the multi-objective power-bandwidth allocation problem is characterized by five regions, each representing a unique performance tradeoff. Second, the reliability of cognitive RR has no impact on the EE-SE tradeoff given unlimited bandwidth and power.","1536-1276;15361276","","10.1109/TWC.2015.2417550","863 Project in 5G Wireless Networking; EU FP7 QUICK project; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Ministry of Education; Opening Project of the Key Laboratory of Cognitive Radio and Information Processing (Guilin University of Electronic Technology); 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002855 - Ministry of Science and Technology of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7072559","Cognitive radio;energy efficiency;spectral efficiency;trade-off","Bandwidth;Measurement;Relays;Reliability;Resource management;Upper bound;Wireless communication","Gaussian channels;Pareto optimisation;bandwidth allocation;cognitive radio;cooperative communication;energy conservation;relay networks (telecommunication);resource allocation;telecommunication power management","HCGRC;Pareto-optimal EE-SE tradeoff curve;cognitive radio;cognitive-unlicensed RR;energy efficiency;hybrid cognitive Gaussian relay channels;hybrid cooperative communication system;licensed radio resource;multiobjective power-bandwidth allocation problem;optimal power-bandwidth allocation strategies;optimal resource allocation;relay transmissions;resource constraint;spectrum efficiency","","4","","47","","","20150330","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This method has wide adaptability for different types of sparse matrices, and is different from existing methods which only adapt to some particular sparse matrices. In addition, our partitioning method can obtain dense blocks by analyzing the probability distribution of non-zero elements in a sparse matrix, and result in very low proportion of zero padded. We make the following significant contributions. (1) We present a partitioning strategy of sparse matrices based on probabilistic modeling of non-zero elements in a row. (2) We prove that our method has the highest mean density compared with other strategies according to certain given ratios of partition obtained from the computing powers of heterogeneous processors. (3) We develop a CPU-GPU hybrid parallel computing model for SpMV on GPUs and multicore CPUs in a heterogeneous computing platform. Our partitioning strategy has balanced load distribution and the performance of SpMV is significantly improved when a sparse matrix is partitioned into dense blocks using our method. The average performance improvement of our solution for SpMV is about 15.75 percent on multicore CPUs, compared to that of the other solutions. By considering the rows of a matrix in a unique order based on the probability mass function of the number of non-zeros in a row, the average performance improvement of our solution for SpMV is about 33.52 percent on GPUs and multicore CPUs of a heterogeneous computing platform, compared to that of the partitioning methods based on the original row order of a matrix.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2014.2366731","Hunan Provincial Education Department; Hunan Science and Technology Commission; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6965639","GPU;matrix partition;multicore CPU;probability distribution;sparse matrix-vector multiplication","Computational modeling;Multicore processing;Partitioning algorithms;Program processors;Sparse matrices;Vectors","graphics processing units;matrix multiplication;multiprocessing systems;parallel algorithms;sparse matrices;statistical distributions","CPU-GPU hybrid parallel computing model;balanced load distribution;heterogeneous computing platform;heterogeneous processors;multicore CPU;partitioned SpMV;probability distribution;probability mass function;sparse matrix partitioning strategy;sparse matrix-vector multiplication","","16","","36","","","20141124","Sept. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In our previous work [1], an optimal design of BMIs based on artificial sensory feedback was developed using model predictive control which relied on neuronal activity in the form of spiking. From a real implementation perspective, a more generalized framework that utilizes spiking is proposed in this paper. Specifically, a charge-balanced intra-cortical micro-stimulation (ICMS) current and a network of spiking neurons are adopted to compensate the lost feedback information. Next, an artificial sensory feedback framework using the network of spiking neurons is designed based on model predictive control (MPC) strategy, and an optimization problem is formulated according to this framework. Since the charge-balanced ICMS current is composed of several integer parameters, the optimization problem also includes some integer decision variables and is hard to be solved. In this paper, a heuristic population-based search algorithm called particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to solve this optimization problem. Considering the updated particles may violate the input constraints, additional constraints are designed to guarantee that the decision variables can satisfy the input constraints. Finally, simulation results show the effectiveness of the designed closed-loop BMIs during recovery of natural performance.","0743-1619;07431619","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-8685-9; Electronic:978-1-4799-8684-2; POD:978-1-4799-1773-0","10.1109/ACC.2015.7171117","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7171117","","Algorithm design and analysis;Decoding;Integrated circuit modeling;Joints;Neurons;Optimization;Trajectory","brain-computer interfaces;closed loop systems;feedback;neurophysiology;optimal control;particle swarm optimisation;predictive control;search problems","MPC strategy;PSO algorithm;artificial sensory feedback;charge-balanced ICMS current;charge-balanced intra-cortical microstimulation;closed-loop BMI;closed-loop brain-machine interfaces;cortical neuronal activity;feedback information;heuristic population-based search algorithm;human-machine integration systems;impaired motor tasks restoration;input constraints;integer decision variables;integer parameters;model predictive control;optimal design;optimization problem;particle swarm optimization;spiking neurons","","0","","22","","","","1-3 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Combinatorial testing (CT) aims to generate small sets of test cases to uncover defects caused by those factors and their interactions. Covering array generation, a discrete optimization problem, is the most popular research area in the field of CT. Particle swarm optimization (PSO), an evolutionary search-based heuristic technique, has succeeded in generating covering arrays that are competitive in size. However, current PSO methods for covering array generation simply round the particle's position to an integer to handle the discrete search space. Moreover, no guidelines are available to effectively set PSOs parameters for this problem. In this paper, we extend the set-based PSO, an existing discrete PSO (DPSO) method, to covering array generation. Two auxiliary strategies (particle reinitialization and additional evaluation of gbest) are proposed to improve performance, and thus a novel DPSO for covering array generation is developed. Guidelines for parameter settings both for conventional PSO (CPSO) and for DPSO are developed systematically here. Discrete extensions of four existing PSO variants are developed, in order to further investigate the effectiveness of DPSO for covering array generation. Experiments show that CPSO can produce better results using the guidelines for parameter settings, and that DPSO can generate smaller covering arrays than CPSO and other existing evolutionary algorithms. DPSO is a promising improvement on PSO for covering array generation.","1089-778X;1089778X","","10.1109/TEVC.2014.2362532","Australian Research Council Linkage; Major Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China; Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China; Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6919298","Combinatorial Testing;Combinatorial testing (CT);Covering Array Generation;Particle Swarm Optimization;covering array generation;particle swarm optimization (PSO)","Arrays;Guidelines;Optimization;Particle swarm optimization;Servers;Testing","combinatorial mathematics;evolutionary computation;particle swarm optimisation;search problems","CPSO;CT;DPSO;auxiliary strategies;combinatorial testing;conventional PSO;covering array generation;discrete particle swarm optimization;discrete search space;evolutionary search-based heuristic technique;gbest;parameter settings;particle reinitialization;software behavior","","7","","39","","","20141009","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It uses a decomposition-based strategy for evolving its working population and uses a domination-based sorting for maintaining the external archive. Information extracted from the external archive is used to decide which search regions should be searched at each generation. In such a way, the domination-based sorting and the decomposition strategy can complement each other. In our experimental studies, the proposed algorithm is compared with a domination-based approach, a decomposition-based one, and one of its enhanced variants on two well-known multiobjective combinatorial optimization problems.

Intrapreneurship defined as the innovative initiatives undertaken inside an organization is an effective strategy to address these complexities systematically. Successful ideas within an organization occur due to the tireless persistence and practical imagination of intrapreneurs who are the smart innovators actively involved in the design and creation of new products, ventures and business models. Today there is an increasing global demand for such intrapreneurs and different universities are therefore adopting various entrepreneurship education and training programmes to cater to this. Pedagogy in higher education is also witnessing a significant rise in new interdisciplinary programmes specifically designed for non-business students such as art, engineering, and science students so as to develop their organizational management skills. This paper sheds light on these growing trends of different University programmes and examines their effectiveness. It utilizes an in-depth study of one such successful case: the MSc Engineering Management programme in the University of York, United Kingdom in its role of enhancing intrapreneurial skills of global students.

To this end, a new paradigm is required for optimization of a more generalized environment. This environment would include various nodes of different processing and communication abilities constrained by circuit powers and residual energy over individual dynamic wireless channels. In this paper, we present a novel strategy named link capacity-energy aware wireless distributed computing (LEA-WDC) for maximizing the lifetime of a wireless network. The major advantage of LEA-WDC is its achievement of lifetime maximization by systematically reconciling highly coupled system parameters (tasks, processing power, communication power, and residual energy) in terms of the role of nodes and the layer of each node. To attain an optimal solution, we perform unique interworking optimization via decomposition in accordance with the roles of header and slave nodes. The evaluation results of our simulation verify that the lifetime is further maximized by finding the optimal transmission power of each node according to the Shannon capacity.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2014.2360372","Convergence Information Technology Research Center; 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; 10.13039/501100003621 - Ministry of Science, ICT&Future Planning; 10.13039/501100003665 - National IT Industry Promotion Agency; 10.13039/501100003725 - National Research Foundation of Korea; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6910304","Wireless distributed computing;interworking optimization;network lifetime;processing-power control;task-power allocation","Distributed computing;Downlink;Energy consumption;Resource management;Uplink;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","distributed processing;open systems;optimisation;radio links;radio networks;telecommunication computing;wireless channels","LEA-WDC;Shannon capacity;circuit powers;communication power;distributed computing;distributed nodes;dynamic wireless channels;generalized environment;interoperability;interworking optimization;link capacity energy aware WDC;link capacity energy aware wireless distributed computing;network lifetime maximization;optimal transmission power;optimization;processing power;residual energy;wireless network environments","","2","","26","","","20140925","Aug. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, due to the ad hoc nature of femtocells, there is a great challenge to mitigate interference, which may seriously compromise the benefits promised by this novel network architecture. This paper investigates the distributed subchannel allocation (DSA) for cotier interference mitigation in OFDMA-based femtocells, where the femtocells and macrocell transmit on orthogonal subchannels. Particularly, to intuitively study system performance, we formulate this problem as a noncooperative rate maximization game where the utility of each player or femtocell access point is its capacity instead of the incoming interference. Unfortunately, the uncertainty of the existence of the Nash equilibrium for this game makes it difficult to design efficient distributed schemes. To address this issue, we introduce a state space to reflect players' desire for new strategies and then devise a utility-based learning model that requires no information exchange between different players. Utilizing this model, a utility-based DSA algorithm is developed. Moreover, it is analytically shown that the Pareto-optimal solution can be achieved with our proposed algorithm, and as a result, the overall capacity can be efficiently improved, and the system interference can be efficiently mitigated. Finally, simulation results verify the validity of our analysis and demonstrate that our scheme performs comparably or even better compared with the existing strategies, which require information exchange among different femtocells.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2014.2344434","111 Project; 863 Project; Key Laboratory of Cognitive Radio and Information Processing (Guilin University of Electronic Technology); Ministry of Education, China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6868315","Distributed subchannel allocation;Pareto optimality;femtocells;interference mitigation;orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)","Algorithm design and analysis;Femtocell networks;Femtocells;Games;Interference;Resource management;Tin","OFDM modulation;femtocellular radio;frequency division multiple access;game theory;interference suppression;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing","DSA algorithm;Nash equilibrium;OFDMA femtocells;Pareto-optimal solution;cotier interference mitigation;distributed subchannel allocation;network architecture;noncooperative rate maximization game;orthogonal frequency-division multiple access;orthogonal subchannels;state space;utility-based learning approach","","12","","37","","","20140730","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Spatial diversity in the netted radars gives us a flexibility to control power intelligently and radar assignment dynamically in such a way that not only detection performances satisfied but LPI characteristics of the network are optimized. We formulate this problem as a non-convex and nonlinear optimization problem associated with detection performance constraints. The optimum solution of general problem is complicated and cannot be solved mathematically. We relaxed problem to more tractable form for the networks with low complexity in which combination of radar's information cannot be handled. In the considered scenario, for each target only one radar is assigned and each assigned radar can only transmit one target's information. We propose a simple framework to obtain optimum power allocation and radar assignment strategy due to spatial diversity of netted radars.

This system consists of a capacity-constrained renewable power supplier (RPS) and a base station (BS) that faces a predictable random connection demand from mobile user equipments (UEs). In this model, the BS, which is powered via a combination of a renewable power source and the conventional electric grid, seeks to specify the renewable power inventory policy, i.e., the power storage level. On the other hand, the RPS must strategically choose the energy amount that is supplied to the BS. An M/M/1 make-to-stock queuing model is proposed to investigate the decentralized decisions when the two parties optimize their individual costs in a noncooperative manner. The problem is formulated as a noncooperative game whose Nash equilibrium (NE) strategies are characterized to identify the causes of inefficiency in the decentralized operation. A set of simple linear contracts are introduced to coordinate the system so as to achieve an optimal system performance. The proposed approach is then extended to a setting with one monopolistic RPS and N BSs that are privately informed of their optimal energy inventory levels. In this scenario, we show that the widely used proportional allocation mechanism is no longer socially optimal. To make the BSs truthfully report their energy demand, an incentive compatible (IC) mechanism is proposed for our model. Simulation results show that using the green energy can present significant traditional energy savings for the BS when the connection demand is not heavy. Moreover, the proposed scheme provides valuable energy cost savings by allowing the BSs to smartly use a combination of renewable and traditional energy, even when the BS has a heavy traffic of connections. Also, the results show that performance of the proposed IC mechanism will be close to the social optimal when the green energy production capacity i- creases.","0090-6778;00906778","","10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2424242","Basic Research Program of Jiangsu Province (NSF), China (BK2012434); China National Science Foundation; National Key Project of China (2010ZX03003-003-02); New Teacher Fund for Doctor Station of the Ministry of Education, China (20123223120001,20133223120002); Postdoctoral Research Fund of China (2012M511790); The National Fundamental Research Grant of China; ¿¿¿Towards Energy-Efficient Hyper-Dense Wireless Networks with Trillions of Devices¿¿¿, a Commissioned Research of National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Japan; 10.13039/100000001 - U.S. National Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7088597","Green communications;contract;game theory;mechanism design;renewable power supply","Base stations;Energy storage;Games;Green products;Quality of service;Queueing analysis;Renewable energy sources","cellular radio;environmental factors;game theory;queueing theory;renewable energy sources;telecommunication power supplies","M/M/1 make-to-stock queuing model;Nash equilibrium strategies;RPS;UE;capacity-constrained renewable power supplier;conventional electric grid;decentralized energy allocation;green energy;green energy production capacity;green wireless communication system;mobile user equipments;noncooperative game;optimal energy inventory levels;power storage level;proportional allocation mechanism;random connection demand;renewable energy powered base stations;renewable energy sources;renewable power inventory policy;valuable energy cost savings;wireless networks","","6","","41","","","20150417","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

More precisely, the objective is to declare one of the functions in H as the true label generating function with high confidence using as a few label queries as possible, by selecting the queries adaptively and in a strategic manner. Previous work in Bayesian active learning considers generalized binary search and its variants for the noisy case, and analyzes the number of queries required by these sampling strategies. In this paper, we show that these schemes are, in general, suboptimal. Instead we propose and analyze an alternative strategy for sample collection. Our sampling strategy is motivated by a connection between Bayesian active learning and active hypothesis testing, and is based on querying the label of a sample, which maximizes the extrinsic Jensen-Shannon divergence at each step. We provide upper and lower bounds on the performance of this sampling strategy, and show that these bounds are better than the previous bounds in the literature.","0018-9448;00189448","","10.1109/TIT.2015.2432101","NSF; industrial sponsors of UCSD through the Center for Wireless Communication; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7105932","Bayesian active learning;Extrinsic Jensen–Shannon divergence;extrinsic Jensen–Shannon divergence;generalized binary search;hypothesis testing","Bayes methods;Complexity theory;Education;Noise;Noise measurement;Testing;Upper bound","belief networks;learning (artificial intelligence)","Jensen-Shannon divergence;finite set;generalized binary search;independent noise corruption;label query;noisy Bayesian active learning;noisy case;nonpersistent noise;sample collection;sample space;strategic manner","","3","","31","","","20150512","July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose an efficient ME and DE algorithm for reducing the computational complexity of MVC. Firstly, according to the characteristics of the coded block pattern and rate distortion (RD) cost, an early DIRECT mode decision algorithm is proposed. Then, based on the characteristics of the initial search point in the ME/DE process and the observation that the best point is center-biased, an early ME/DE termination strategy is proposed. If the ME/DE early termination is not satisfied, the ME/DE search window will be reduced by applying the optimal theory. At last, two block matching search strategies are proposed to predict the best point for the ME/DE. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve 50.05% to 77.61%, 64.83% on average encoding time saving. Meanwhile, the RD performance degradation is negligible.

Even though the previous T1FNN method can achieve the required tasks, the performance of the previous T1FNN method is not satisfactory in the following sense. The previous T1FNN cannot reduce the influence of uncertainties effectively because it uses the crisp set as the membership values. In addition, it can result in the large oscillation behavior during the obstacle avoidance. Accordingly, we should design the IT2FNN method to improve the performance with smoother behavior as well as improved obstacle avoidance. The proposed IT2FNN method has the fuzzy neural network structure different from the T1FNN. Since the IT2FNN uses the fuzzy set instead of the crisp set as the membership values and it is robust against uncertainties, the performance of the robot behavior can be significantly improved especially in the presence of obstacles.

The approach integrates object information from radars and lane information from a camera with three steps: track-to-track fusion, curvilinear coordinate conversion, and lane assessment. The track-to-track fusion is achieved through a nearest neighbor filter that updates the target state estimation and covariance with the nearest neighbor measurement, and a cross-covariance method that merges the duplicate tracks using error covariance. In order to determine in which lane the fused tracks are located accurately and reliably, the curvilinear coordinate conversion process is performed. The curvilinear coordinates are generated in the form of a cubic Hermite spline lane model from the lane information of the camera. Based on the converted track information and the lane model in the curvilinear coordinates, the probability distribution of the threat levels in each lane is determined though a probabilistic lane association and threat assessment. The developed algorithm is verified and evaluated through experiments using a real-time embedded system. The results show that the proposed curvilinear-coordinate-based approach provides excellent performance of object and situation assessment, in respect of accuracy and computational efficiency, in real-time operation.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2014.2369737","BK21 Plus Program of the Ministry of Education; Energy Resource R&D Program; Industrial Strategy Technology Development Program of the Ministry of Knowledge Economy (MKE); MKE and Korea Institute for the Advancement of Technology; 10.13039/501100001321 - National Research Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7012068","Curvilinear coordinates;data fusion;intelligent vehicle;object detection and tracking;situation assessment","Boolean functions;Data integration;Data structures;Radar tracking;Roads;Vehicles","cameras;intelligent transportation systems;road vehicles;state estimation;statistical distributions","camera;cubic Hermite spline lane model;curved road conditions;curvilinear coordinate conversion;curvilinear-coordinate-based object assessment;curvilinear-coordinate-based situation assessment;embedded system;error covariance;highly automated vehicles;lane assessment;lane information;probabilistic lane association;probability distribution;target state estimation;threat assessment;threat levels","","2","","44","","","20150116","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To meet this challenge, a new medical image protection scheme using hyperchaos-based encryption is suggested in this paper. Improvements have been made to both permutation and diffusion methods to address the security problems encountered by many existing chaos-based image ciphers. In the permutation stage, a pixel swapping-based strategy is introduced instead of using the area-preserving chaotic maps, and the swapping operation is determined by the first two state variables of the employed 4-D hyperchaotic system. During the diffusion procedure, the key stream elements, quantified from the other two state variables, are circularly shifted according to the plain-pixels. Consequently, the keystream is related to both the key and the plain-image, which ensures the security against known/ chosen-plaintext attack. Thorough experimental tests are carried out and the results indicate that the proposed scheme provides an effective way for online secure medical image transmission over public networks.","2326-828X;2326828X","Electronic:978-1-4799-8072-7; POD:978-1-4799-8073-4","10.1109/ISMICT.2015.7107507","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7107507","hyperchaotic system;medical image protection;permutation-diffusion;pseudorandom number sequence","Biomedical imaging;Chaotic communication;Ciphers;Encryption","chaos;cryptography;medical image processing;telecommunication security;telemedicine;visual communication","area-preserving chaotic maps;chaos-based image ciphers;chosen-plaintext attack;hyperchaos-based encryption;medical image protection scheme;pixel swapping-based strategy;security problems;teleradiology services","","2","","10","","","","24-26 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the node usually only has the local CSI between itself and other nodes, and lacks the CSI between any pair of other nodes. To enable all the nodes to get the global CSI, in this paper, we propose a network-coded third-party information exchange scheme, with an emphasis on minimizing the total transmission cost for ( ) exchanging the CSI among the nodes. We show that for a network of N nodes, if and only if any k nodes (1 ≤ k <; N) send at least (2 : k) packets, a feasible solution exists for third-party information exchange. Formulating the problem of feasible and optimal solutions as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, we compute the optimal number of packets that must be transmitted by every node. Guided by the necessary and sufficient condition, we construct two practical transmission schemes: fair load (FL) scheme and proportional load (PL) scheme. A deterministic encoding strategy based on XORs coding over GF(2) is further designed to guarantee that with FL or PL scheme, each node finally can decode the complete packets. It is shown that in two specific networks, these two schemes are optimal, achieving the minimum transmission cost. In more general networks, simulation results show that PL is still close to optimal with a high probability. Finally, a distributed transmission protocol is developed, which allows FL and PL schemes to be operated in a distributed and hence scalable manner.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2014.2350989","Singapore University of Technology and Design; State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University; 10.13039/100000001 - National Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Nature Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6882233","Network coding;channel state information;cooperative data exchange","Batteries;Educational institutions;Encoding;Information exchange;Mobile computing;Network coding;Vectors","integer programming;linear programming;network coding;radio networks","CSI;XOR;channel gain;channel state information;fair load scheme;integer linear programming;link loss probability;network coding;network-coded third-party information exchange scheme;proportional load scheme;transmission cost;wireless networks","","6","","32","","","20140822","June 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Matrix completion (MC) has recently been introduced as a method for transductive (semisupervised) multilabel classification, and has several distinct advantages, including robustness to missing data and background noise in both feature and label space. However, it is limited by only considering data represented by a single-view feature, which cannot precisely characterize images containing several semantic concepts. To utilize multiple features taken from different views, we have to concatenate the different features as a long vector. However, this concatenation is prone to over-fitting and often leads to very high time complexity in MC-based image classification. Therefore, we propose to weightedly combine the MC outputs of different views, and present the multiview MC (MVMC) framework for transductive multilabel image classification. To learn the view combination weights effectively, we apply a cross-validation strategy on the labeled set. In particular, MVMC splits the labeled set into two parts, and predicts the labels of one part using the known labels of the other part. The predicted labels are then used to learn the view combination coefficients. In the learning process, we adopt the average precision (AP) loss, which is particular suitable for multilabel image classification, since the ranking-based criteria are critical for evaluating a multilabel classification system. A least squares loss formulation is also presented for the sake of efficiency, and the robustness of the algorithm based on the AP loss compared with the other losses is investigated. Experimental evaluation on two real-world data sets (PASCAL VOC' 07 and MIR Flickr) demonstrate the effectiveness of MVMC for transductive (semisupervised) multilabel image classification, and show that MVMC can exploit complem- ntary properties of different features and output-consistent labels for improved multilabel image classification.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2015.2421309","National Basic Research Program of China; 10.13039/501100000923 - Australian Research Council; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7083747","Image classification;average precision;matrix completion;multi-label;multi-view;transductive","Least squares approximations;Minimization;Optimization;Robustness;Support vector machines","computational complexity;feature extraction;image classification;least squares approximations;matrix algebra","AP loss;MC-based image classification;MVMC framework;average precision loss;features concatenate;learning process;least squares loss formulation;multilabel image classification;multiview MC framework;multiview matrix completion;ranking- based criteria;single-view feature;time complexity;web-based image analytics-based application","","30","","80","","","20150409","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Mobile devices have resource limitations. Consequently, web pages designed for desktop browsing cannot be well displayed on mobile devices. Thus, dynamically transforming web contents designed for desktops into contents which can be displayed in a mobile device is an important task. Various approaches of content adaptation have been proposed to achieve this goal, but no single content adaptation strategy has been found to be effective. On the other hand, e-learning contents have grown manifold over years. In this paper, we provide a framework for an e-learning content adaptation system that can be used with desktops and mobile devices seamlessly. We combine multiple content adaptation strategies to make e-learning contents appropriate for mobile devices. Among the various content adaptation strategies, the segmentation algorithm plays the most important role.

Traditional fusion strategies, e.g. Bayesian fusion, directly adopt each uni-modal likelihood without giving enough attention to the fact that all these likelihoods are often vulnerable to sample data and modality-specific identification algorithm, which could possibly incur inaccuracy of, say, target recognition in a practical application. To address this issue, the paper presents a likelihood confidence rating strategy to fix traditional Bayesian fusion. Due to the great importance to the modalities with more accurate likelihoods, the strategy is capable of assigning different weights to each modality meticulously. We extensively evaluate the proposed strategy on our dextrous robotic hand testbed.

The main facts this paper demonstrate are that traffic models lack consideration of car following, which would make the simulation result unrealistic, that the proposed MaxTM can reduce more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions than the MinADM and the OTLCM, and the total travel time in the MaxTM is also better than the other two models so that the general traffic performance can be improved. Simulation results show that the performance of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the MaxTM is 5%-102% better than the MinADM and 13%-209% better than the OTLCM in the simulation cases, and the performance of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the MaxTM is 8%-14% better than the MinADM and 15%-231% better than the OTLCM in the real traffic cases.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2014.2305761","Headquarters of University Advancement, National Cheng Kung University, which is sponsored by the Ministry of Education, Taiwan; National Science Council of Taiwan; Research Center for Energy Technology and Strategy of the National Cheng Kung University; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6737317","Carbon emission reduction;Decision tree;Vehicular ad-hoc network(VANET);decision tree;vehicular ad hoc network(VANET)","Acceleration;Air pollution;Biological system modeling;Fuels;Licenses;Throughput;Vehicles","air pollution control;energy conservation;road vehicles;vehicular ad hoc networks","MaxTM;MinADM;OTLCM;SCM;VANET technology;carbon dioxide emission reduction;energy saving;maximize throughput model;minimize acceleration and deceleration model;open traffic light control model;signal countdown messages;vehicular ad hoc networks","","5","","24","","OAPA","20140211","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This is especially important in learning environments where the user needs to focus on subject material rather than on the device used to record or store the subject information. Using Tablet PCs and slate devices, instructors are able to increase their effectiveness by making more dynamic presentations and by incorporating active exercises into their classroom environments. Tablet PCs also enable better and more natural note-taking by students and easier after-class review of course material and notes. Further, Tablet PCs facilitate better interaction with persons participating in classroom sessions from remote locations since they easily involve students exchanging visual descriptions of concepts with the instructor and the rest of the class. Several software packages are available to support the pedagogical needs of the university classroom as well as typical group collaborative environments. Classroom Presenter, DyKnow, WriteOn, LectureTools, and MS OneNote with the Interactive Classroom and Math Add in are examples of some of the packages that provide excellent classroom capabilities. These packages allow for a highly interactive environment with both teacher-student and student-student bi-direction real-time interaction. See www.ee.vt.edu/~igtront/tabletpc/ to download tablet PC software. Electronic textbook frameworks like VText are being developed to allow students to have an electronic textbook on their tablet or slate devices. This workshop will also explore the use of these frameworks and how they may be used to enhance student learning practices. In this hands-on tutorial faculty will receive an introduction to the use of Classroom Presenter, OneNote, Interactive Classroom, VText, VectorPad, LectureTools, and PDF Annotator. We will provide sufficient instruction for faculty to have a basic comp- tency with the technology. Most importantly, we will show faculty various pedagogical practices that we have found helpful in using these technology tools in the classroom over the past seven years. Active learning exercises for various disciplines will be emphasized. Faculty will be tasked with developing short active learning exercises starting from the development of goals for the exercise, through the desired student interaction, and ending with the exercise assessment and improvement strategy. These active learning exercises will be targeted to students who are expected to be in the classroom as well as those who may be taking the course at extended campus locations. Exercises will be determined by the individual faculty member's disciplinary interests.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4799-3922-0; POD:978-1-4799-3923-7; USB:978-1-4799-3921-3","10.1109/FIE.2014.7043987","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7043987","active learning;electronic ink;engagement;evaluation;tablet PC","Abstracts;Awards activities;Decision support systems;Engineering education;Ink","computer aided instruction;notebook computers","Classroom Presenter;DyKnow;Interactive Classroom;LectureTools;MS OneNote;Math Add;WriteOn;active learning classroom experience;classroom environment;electronic ink;exercise assessment;improvement strategy;learning environment;pedagogical practices;personal computers;slate devices;student interaction;tablet PC;touch gesture input;user interaction;visual description","","0","","","","","","22-25 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Representative SNPs are not only instrumental in reducing the cost of genotyping, but also serve an important function in narrowing the combinatorial space in epistasis analysis. The capacity of kernel SNPs to unify informative SNP and tag SNP is explored, and inconsistencies are minimized in further studies. The correlation between multiple SNPs is formalized using multi-information measures. In extending the correlation, a distance formula for measuring the similarity between clusters is first designed to conduct hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering consists of both information gain and haplotype diversity, so that the proposed approach can achieve unification. The kernel SNPs are then selected from every cluster through the top rank or backward elimination scheme. Using these kernel SNPs, extensive experimental comparisons are conducted between informative SNPs on haplotype reconstruction accuracy and tag SNPs on haplotype coverage. Results indicate that the kernel SNP can practically unify informative SNP and tag SNP and is therefore adaptable to various applications.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2014.2351797","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Hunan Provincial Innovation Foundation For Postgraduate; National Nature Science Foundation of China; National Nature Science Foundation of Hunan province; Planned Science and Technology Project of Hunan Province; 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; 10.13039/501100004602 - Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6894187","Tag SNP;clustering;informative SNP;support vector machine","Accuracy;Bioinformatics;Computational complexity;Correlation;Entropy;Kernel","bioinformatics;genetics;genomics;pattern clustering;polymorphism","backward elimination scheme;combinatorial space;epistasis analysis;genotyping;haplotype coverage;haplotype diversity;haplotype reconstruction accuracy;hierarchical clustering method;information gain;multiinformation measures;representative single nucleotide polymorphisms;selecting kernel SNP;tag SNP;unify informative SNP","Cluster Analysis;Computational Biology;Databases, Genetic;Haplotypes;Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide;Support Vector Machine","1","","26","","","20140908","Jan.-Feb. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In a WBAN, network longevity is a major challenge due to the limitation of the availability of energy supply in body nodes. Therefore, routing protocols can play a key role towards making such networks energy efficient. In this work, we exhibit that a routing protocol together with an effective body node coordinator (BNC) deployment strategy can influence the network lifetime eminently. Our initial work shows that the variation in the placement of a BNC within a WBAN could significantly vary the overall network lifetime. This motivated us to work on an effective node placement strategy for a BNC, within a WBAN; and thus we propose three different BNC placement algorithms considering different features of available energy efficient routing protocols in a WBAN.

At present, Russia has a well-developed economy of the twentieth century. It largely consists in the extraction and export of mineral resources. The twenty first century calls for an innovation economy. It is intellect-intensive with a high added value. Information technologies are at the heart of such an economy. The Russian government has adopted a Strategy for the development of the IT sector, but there are challenges to deal with. The biggest challenge, however, is a shortage of highly qualified IT professionals. The authors have put the shortage at 130 000 - to 280 000 IT people within a five-year timeframe, which is in line with most of the other assessments. It's worth noting that IT people will be hard to import, even though Russia is in second place world-wide in attracting labor migrants. Europe has a sharper shortage and enjoys a higher standard of living, so Russia will find it hard to compete. In other words, Russia can bridge the shortage only by graduating more IT professionals. The first steps in this direction have been taken, i.e. Innopolis University, Technopark Mail.ru, but it's not enough. The good work must continue, otherwise modernization will dry up.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4437-8; POD:978-1-4799-4436-1; USB:978-1-4799-4438-5","10.1109/ICL.2014.7017787","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7017787","","Companies;Educational institutions;Europe;Government;Industries","DP industry;computer science education;government;innovation management;professional aspects","IT professionals;IT sector development;Russian IT industry;Russian government;education;information technologies;innovation economy;mineral resource exporting;mineral resource extraction","","0","","8","","","","3-6 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a practical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-modulated DCC scheme for underwater relay networks, where OFDM modulation accommodates multipath fading channels with large delay spread. Two cooperation strategies are studied, where the relay transmits either identical or different OFDM blocks as the source during the cooperation phase. The block-level synchronization between the OFDM blocks from the source and the relay is achieved by a delay control mechanism at the relay, by knowing the distances among the source, relay, and destination. Two OFDM-DCC design examples are presented, one based on nonbinary rate-compatible low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes applied across multiple OFDM blocks, and the other using layered interblock erasure correction and intrablock error-correction coding. In addition to simulation studies, one particular design has been implemented on practical OFDM modems, and tested in a swimming pool and in a recent sea experiment. The proposed OFDM-DCC scheme is particularly appealing to underwater acoustic (UWA) networks where a relay node with abundant resources (e.g., a surface buoy) can enhance communications among underwater nodes without changing their transmission procedure.","0364-9059;03649059","","10.1109/JOE.2014.2304254","; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6826587","Dynamic coded cooperation (DCC);orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM);rate-compatible coding;underwater acoustic (UWA) communications","Channel coding;Delays;Erbium;OFDM;Receivers;Relays","OFDM modulation;block codes;diversity reception;error correction codes;fading channels;multipath channels;relay networks (telecommunication);underwater acoustic communication","DCC scheme;LDPC codes;OFDM-modulated dynamic coded cooperation;UWA networks;block-level synchronization;delay control mechanism;intrablock error-correction coding;layered interblock erasure correction coding;low-density parity-check codes;multipath fading channels;nonbinary rate-compatible codes;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;relay diversity;relay node;surface buoy;transmission procedure;underwater acoustic channels;underwater relay networks","","10","","30","","","20140605","Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The key idea is to use radio resources mainly on the traffic/connection to which a user pays attention. The TFRC withdraws spectrum resources strategically from connection(s) not focused on by the user, providing reuseable spectrum called “virtual spectrum hole”. Considering an LTE-type cellular network, a double-threshold guard channel policy is proposed to facilitate the implementation of TFRC. An analytical model is established to study benefits of exploiting TFRC in terms of call-level performance, including new call blocking, handoff call dropping, and recovering call dropping probabilities. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, in increasing the cell capacity (maximum user number per cell) while limiting potential service quality degradation introduced by the newly proposed technique.","1536-1276;15361276","","10.1109/TWC.2014.2329912","National Hi-Tech R&D Program of China; National Key Basic Research Program of China; Natural Science and Technology Specific Major Projects; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100000038 - Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6828796","Time-frequency resource conversion;call admission control;call-level performance;context-aware resource allocation;user behavior;virtual spectrum hole","Context awareness;Data communication;Degradation;Quality of service;Resource management;Telecommunication traffic;Time-frequency analysis;Wireless communication","Long Term Evolution;cellular radio;frequency allocation;mobility management (mobile radio)","LTE type cellular network;advanced user equipment;call blocking;call dropping recovery;call level performance;cell capacity;context information;double threshold guard channel policy;handoff call dropping;network congestion;network resource allocation strategy;reuseable spectrum;spectrum resources;time-frequency resource conversion;user behavior-aware time frequency resource conversion;virtual spectrum hole","","6","","30","","","20140610","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to improve the accuracy of bit allocation performance for 3-DVC, a more accurate distortion model for virtual view and rate models for texture videos and depth maps are proposed based on interview rate distortion analysis. Based on the proposed models, the bit allocation optimization problem is resolved by a coarse to fine strategy. The proposed bit allocation algorithm is implemented in the High Efficiency Video Coding-based 3-DVC platform version 6.0 (3-D-HTM 6.0). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed distortion and rate models are accurate; meanwhile, the absolute difference (denoted as “rate inaccuracy”) between the actual coding bit rate (R<sub>ABR</sub>) and the target coding bit rate (R<sub>ABR</sub>) of the proposed method is only 2.67% on average; while the rate inaccuracy of the existing planar model-based method is 17.71%.

The two normal fields, though contain some redundant geometry information of the same model, can provide additional information that the other field lacks. Thus, considering only one normal field is likely to overlook some geometric features. In this paper, we take advantage of the piecewise consistent property of the two normal fields and propose an effective framework in which they are filtered and integrated using a novel method to guide the denoising process. Our key observation is that, decomposing the inconsistent field at challenging regions into multiple piecewise consistent fields makes the two fields complementary to each other and produces better results. Our approach consists of three steps: vertex classification, bi-normal filtering, and vertex position update. The classification step allows us to filter the two fields on a piecewise smooth surface rather than a surface that is smooth everywhere. Based on the piecewise consistence of the two normal fields, we filtered them using a piecewise smooth region clustering strategy. To benefit from the bi-normal filtering, we design a quadratic optimization algorithm for vertex position update. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that our algorithm achieves higher quality results than current approaches on surfaces with multifarious geometric features and irregular surface sampling.","1077-2626;10772626","","10.1109/TVCG.2014.2326872","National Natural Science Foundation; Research Grants Council; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6822598","Mesh denoising;bi-normal filtering;feature preserving;piecewise consistence;piecewise smooth surface","Geometry;Noise;Noise measurement;Noise reduction;Optimization;Smoothing methods;Surface treatment","computer graphics;filtering theory;pattern classification;pattern clustering;quadratic programming;surface fitting","bi-normal filtering;classification step;geometric features;geometry information;mesh denoising technique;mesh surface;piecewise smooth region clustering strategy;quadratic optimization algorithm;vertex classification;vertex normal field;vertex position update","","10","","39","","","20140529","Jan. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We focus on emotion detection in angry-neutral speech, which is common in recent studies of AEVD. This study proposes a novel framework for AEVD using Multi-scaled Sliding Window (MSW-AEVD) to assign an emotion class to each window-shift by fusion decisions of all the sliding windows containing the shift. Firstly, sliding window with fixed-length is introduced as the basic procedure, in which several different fusion methods are investigated. Then multi-scaled sliding window is employed to support multi-classifiers with different timescale features, in which another two fusion strategies are provided. Finally, a postprocessing is applied to refine the final outputs. Performance evaluation is carried out on the public Berlin database EMO-DB.

To this end, SDR is employed to reformulate the GLRT detection into a semidefinite programming (SDP) model, and two detectors, randomization-SDR (RSDR) and eigenvector-SDR (ESDR) are proposed on the order of O(M<sup>3.5</sup>) and O(M<sup>3</sup>), respectively. Complexity analysis validates that the SDR-MSD strategy is desirable owing to its reduced complexity, compared with the exponential-complexity sphere decoding (SD) MSD.

Many existing algorithms that assume no capture effect will miss the hidden tags. In this paper, we extend an existing algorithm to the capture effect environment and propose a novel tag anti-collision algorithm to enhance the efficiency of tag identification. The proposed algorithm adopts an allocation strategy to reduce collision between the hidden tags by capture effect and the other tags. The strategy lets the collided tags resolved in a current cycle immediately. On the other hand, the hidden tags will enter the next cycle. Thus, the resolved tags will not collide with the hidden tags in the next cycle, and the collision will be reduced.

Whether plagiarism is committed and condone, consciously or unintentionally, the results are not very much different, with students being the very victims of the academic plague: distorted learning experience and undervalued learning outcomes. In addition, the internet has served as a two-edge sword cutting both ways, providing greater access to information and knowledge yet encouraging, though inevitably sometimes, increasing incidents of minor and major intellectual thefts. The circumstances notwithstanding, there is a need to review the culture of integrity or lack of in universities, where it encompasses the institution and system as a whole, the staff as the moral compass and the students seeking transparency and guidance in the matter. It is imperative to identify why students engage in plagiarism, how the current learning environment may have contributed to the rise in such misconduct, and what can be done to mitigate and circumvent plagiarism before it grows out of hand.

Then we study the resource allocation problem to minimize the power grid input while satisfying users' quality of service (outage probability) requirements, where dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is proposed to analyze the outage probability and solve the problem.

We focus on several features of SaaS competition, including differences in vendor offerings, incomplete information on application functionality, the potential lock-in risk of SaaS clients, and their cost of learning about what it will take to make the vendors' software work well. Clients can sample the fit costs of adoption, but can switch to another vendor. We obtained several findings through the use of a game-theoretic model. First, a client's switching cost is important for its decision-making regarding SaaS adoption. With a relatively high switching cost, a more cost-efficient vendor of IT services will be able to drive the less cost-efficient competitor out of its market. Second, the impact of the client's switching cost on vendors works differently. An increase in switching cost enables one vendor to charge a higher price and achieve higher profit, while the other will be forced to charge a lower price and hardly make a profit. Third, what matters is not how much a vendor can enhance service quality, but instead how costly it will be to improve quality enough to attract sufficient customer interest to achieve profitability.","0018-9391;00189391","","10.1109/TEM.2014.2332633","Lee Kuan Yew Faculty Fellowship for Research Excellence at Singapore Management University; Singapore's Ministry of Education Tier 1 Research Support Program; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6857369","Adverse and beneficial lock-in;cost efficiency;economic analysis;quality;services sampling;software-as-a-service (SaaS);strategy;switching costs;vendor competition","Costs;Economics;Software as a service;Subscriptions","DP industry;cloud computing;decision making;game theory;pricing;profitability","IT services;SaaS clients;SaaS competition;application functionality;client switching cost;decision-making;game-theoretic model;lock-in risk;pricing strategy;profitability;quality strategy;software-as-a-service vendors;vendor software work","","3","","50","","","20140716","Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, the effects of NLOS multipath interferences are modeled as mean value jumps appearing on the GNSS pseudo-range measurements. The Marginalized Likelihood Ratio Test (MLRT) is proposed to detect, identify and estimate the NLOS multipath biases. However, the MLRT test statistics is generally difficult to compute. In this work, we consider a Monte Carlo integration technique based on bias magnitude sampling. The Jensen inequality allows this Monte Carlo integration to be simplified. The interacting multiple model algorithm is also used to update the prior information for each bias magnitude sample. Finally, some strategies are designed for estimating and correcting the NLOS multipath biases. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can effectively improve the positioning accuracy in the presence of NLOS multipath interferences.","","Electronic:978-8-4901-2355-3; POD:978-1-4799-1634-4","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915981","GNSS;MLRT;multipath mitigation;multiple model;urban positioning","Equations;Global Positioning System;Pollution measurement;Position measurement;Receivers;Satellites;Vehicles","Monte Carlo methods;radiofrequency interference;satellite navigation;signal detection;signal sampling","GNSS pseudorange measurements;Global Navigation Satellite Systems;Jensen inequality;MLRT;Monte Carlo integration;NLOS multipath bias;bias magnitude sampling;interacting multiple model algorithm;marginalized likelihood ratio test;nonline-of-sight multipath interference;position estimation;positioning accuracy;urban positioning","","0","","19","","","","7-10 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At each depth level, it enables SKIP mode, merge mode, inter 2N × 2N, inter 2N × N, inter N × 2N, inter 2N × nU, inter 2N × nD, inter nL x 2N, inter nR × 2N, inter N × N (only available for the smallest CU), intra 2N × 2N, and intra N × N (only available for the smallest CU) in inter-frames. Similar to H.264/AVC, the mode decision process in HEVC is performed using all the possible depth levels (or CU sizes) and prediction modes to find the one with the least rate distortion (RD) cost using Lagrange multiplier. This achieves the highest coding efficiency, but leads to a very high computational complexity. Since the optimal prediction mode is highly content dependent, it is not efficient to use all the modes. In this paper, we propose a fast inter-mode decision algorithm for HEVC by jointly using the inter-level correlation of quadtree structure and the spatiotemporal correlation. There exist strong correlations of the prediction mode, the motion vector and RD cost between different depth levels and between spatially temporally adjacent CUs. We statistically analyze the prediction mode distribution at each depth level and the coding information correlation among the adjacent CUs. Based on the analysis results, three adaptive inter-mode decision strategies are proposed including early SKIP mode decision, prediction size correlation-based mode decision and RD cost correlation-based mode decision. Experimental results show that the proposed overall algorithm can save 49%-52% computational complexity on average with negligible loss of coding efficiency, exhibiting applicability to various types of video sequences.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2313892","Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission; Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme; Shanghai Rising-Star Program; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6778776","High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC);mode decision;motion estimation (ME)","Algorithm design and analysis;Correlation;Electronic mail;Encoding;Materials;Prediction algorithms;Video coding","computational complexity;image motion analysis;prediction theory;quadtrees;rate distortion theory;spatiotemporal phenomena;video coding","HEVC;Lagrange multiplier;SKIP mode;adaptive inter-mode decision;coding efficiency;coding information correlation;computational complexity;high efficiency video coding;inter-level correlation;least rate distortion;merge mode;optimal prediction mode;prediction mode distribution;quadtree structured coding unit;spatiotemporal correlation;spatiotemporal correlations;video sequences","","50","","40","","","20140326","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The previous work in the field of platoon control is based on two strategies, i.e., the leader-predecessor and bidirectional strategies. In the case of the leader-predecessor strategy, all vehicles should use the information of all the leading and preceding vehicles. On the other hand, the bidirectional strategy uses the information of its neighboring preceding and following vehicles. Due to the drawbacks of the bidirectional strategy, most previous work has preferred to employ the leader-predecessor strategy, which can guarantee stability and improved performance. The bidirectional strategy is, however, advantageous in that its implementation of the actual system becomes much more feasible than that of the leader-predecessor strategy. Thus, to employ the platoon-control law to an actual system, we propose the platoon-control law using a CSMC method for an interconnected vehicular system based on the bidirectional strategy such that the problems arising from communication devices in the previous work can be overcome. In particular, unlike the previous work using the bidirectional strategy, the proposed adaptive platoon-control law can lead to improved control performance of the whole system and can guarantee string stability. The stability analysis and simulation results of the proposed method in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances are included to demonstrate the practical application of the proposed algorithm.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2014.2308535","Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea; Korean Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning through the ¿Information Technology Consilience Creative Program,¿; Ministry of Education, Science and Technology; National Information Technology Industry Promotion Agency (NIPA),; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6782461","Adaptive bidirectional platoon control;coupled sliding mode control (CSMC);interconnected vehicular system;string stability;uncertainties and disturbances","Asymptotic stability;Cascading style sheets;Interconnected systems;Silicon;Stability analysis;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles","adaptive control;intelligent transportation systems;interconnected systems;stability;variable structure systems","CSMC method;adaptive bidirectional platoon control;bidirectional strategies;communication devices;coupled sliding mode control method;interconnected vehicular system;leader-predecessor strategies;platoon-control law;string stability","","17","","22","","","20140402","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the socio-technical mechanisms to enhance teamwork performance are lacking. To meet this gap, we adopt the social computing to affiliate learners' behaviors and offer them computational choices to build a better collaborative learning context. Combining the features of the cloud environment, we have identified a learning flow based on Kolb team learning experience to realize this approach. Such novel learning flow can be executed by our newly designed system, Teamwork as a Service (TaaS), in conjunction with the cloud-hosting learning management systems. Following this learning flow, learners benefit from the functions provided by cloud-based services when cooperating in a mobile environment, being organized into cloud-based teaching strategies namely “Jigsaw Classroom”, planning and publishing tasks, as well as rationalizing task allocation and mutual supervision. In particular, we model the social features related to the collaborative learning activities, and introduce a genetic algorithm approach to grouping learners into appropriate teams with two different team formation scenarios. Experimental results prove our approach is able to facilitate teamwork, while learners' capabilities and preferences are taken into consideration. In addition, empirical evaluations have been conducted to show the improvement of collaborative learning brought by TaaS in real university level courses.","1939-1382;19391382","","10.1109/TLT.2014.2340402","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6860285","Mobile cloud;collaborative learning;learning flow;learning styles;social computing;task allocation","Context;Mobile communication;Social computing;Teamwork;Virtual groups","cloud computing;computer aided instruction;mobile computing","Jigsaw Classroom;Kolb team learning;TaaS;TaaS approach;Teamwork as a Service;cloud based teaching strategies;cloud hosting learning management systems;collaborative learning;collaborative learning context;distributed learners;facilitating social collaboration;mobile cloud based learning;mobile environment;mobile learning;online courses;social computing;socio technical mechanisms;teamwork as a service;virtual teams","","7","","73","","","20140718","July-Sept. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this research, an active interaction controller based on motion recognition and adaptive impedance control is proposed and implemented on a six-DOFs parallel robot for lower limb rehabilitation. The root mean square (RMS) features of EMG signals integrating with the support vector machine (SVM) classifier were used to online predict the lower limb intention in advance and to trigger the robot assistance. The impedance control strategy was adopted to directly influence the robot assistance velocity and allow the exercise to follow a physiological trajectory. Moreover, an adaptive scheme learned the muscle activity level in real time and adapted the robot impedance in accordance with patient's voluntary participation efforts. Experimental results on several healthy subjects demonstrated that the lower limb motion intention can be precisely predicted in advance, and the robot assistance mode was also adjustable based on human-robot interaction and muscle activity level of subjects. Comparing with the conventional EMG-triggered assistance methods, such a strategy can increase patient's motivation because the subject's movement intention, active efforts as well as the muscle activity level changes can be directly reflected in the trajectory pattern and the robot assistance speeds.","1098-7584;10987584","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-2073-0; Electronic:978-1-4799-2072-3; POD:978-1-4799-2074-7","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2014.6891705","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6891705","EMG;active interaction control;impedance control;motion recognition;rehabilitation robot","Electromyography;Force;Impedance;Muscles;Robots;Training;Trajectory","adaptive control;electromyography;human-robot interaction;medical robotics;medical signal processing;motion control;patient rehabilitation;signal classification;support vector machines;trajectory control;velocity control","EMG signals;RMS feature;SVM classifier;active interaction control;adaptive impedance control;electromyography;human-robot interaction;interaction force;interactive patient training;lower limb rehabilitation;motion recognition;muscle activity level;parallel robot;passive phase;patient cooperative;patient voluntary participation efforts;patient-driven phase;physiological trajectory;rehabilitation robot;robot assistance;robot assistance velocity;root mean square feature;support vector machine;trajectory pattern","","0","","20","","","","6-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this plan of action, we considered three phases: in the 1st phase we evaluated several methodologies for introducing Scratch; in the 2nd phase we focused on collaborative learning in small groups; in the 3rd phase the focus was on developing a game with the whole class. For the duration of this study, it was noticeable that the group of students easily adapted to Scratch. We concluded that the use of this tool motivates students and improves the learning process. It also contributes to a higher level of concentration and promotes collaborative learning. Additionally, it facilitates creativity, dialogue and the overall relationship among students.

To achieve these objectives we have developed, over a school year, teaching and active learning strategies, where students were asked to search, select and critically evaluate information to produce vodcasts and reflect on these processes. The vodcasts were produced taking into account some of the principles of the cognitive theory of multimedia learning and the cognitive load theory for the production of multimedia messages. Students joined with enthusiasm and commitment to this methodology and have made a very positive review, stating that this allowed them to acquire scientific and technical knowledge, develop digital and communication skills, and work in teams, in a learning environment that provided them with a high degree of freedom, personal satisfaction and autonomy. The vodcasts were inserted into a rich technological classroom environment, such as the use of Moodle and the production of ePortfolios.

While different algorithms have been proposed for tumor clustering, few make use of the expert's knowledge to better the performance of tumor discovery. In this paper, we first view the expert's knowledge as constraints in the process of clustering, and propose a feature selection based semi-supervised cluster ensemble framework (FS-SSCE) for tumor clustering from bio-molecular data. Compared with traditional tumor clustering approaches, the proposed framework FS-SSCE is featured by two properties: (1) The adoption of feature selection techniques to dispel the effect of noisy genes. (2) The employment of the binate constraint based K-means algorithm to take into account the effect of experts' knowledge. Then, a double selection based semi-supervised cluster ensemble framework (DS-SSCE) which not only applies the feature selection technique to perform gene selection on the gene dimension, but also selects an optimal subset of representative clustering solutions in the ensemble and improve the performance of tumor clustering using the normalized cut algorithm. DS-SSCE also introduces a confidence factor into the process of constructing the consensus matrix by considering the prior knowledge of the data set. Finally, we design a modified double selection based semi-supervised cluster ensemble framework (MDS-SSCE) which adopts multiple clustering solution selection strategies and an aggregated solution selection function to choose an optimal subset of clustering solutions. The results in the experiments on cancer gene expression profiles show that (i) FS-SSCE, DS-SSCE and MDS-SSCE are suitable for performing tumor clustering from bio-molecular data. (ii) MDS-SSCE outperforms a number of state-of-the-art tumor clustering approaches on most of the data sets.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2014.2315996","City University of Hong Kong; Cooperation Project in Industry, Education and Academy of Guangdong Province and Ministry of Education of China; Doctoral Program of Higher Education; Foundation of Guangdong Educational Committee; Fundamental Research Funds; Guangdong Natural Science Funds; Hong Kong Baptist University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University; Hong Kong Scholars Program; Key Enterprises and Innovation Organizations; NSFC-Guangdong Joint Fund; National Natural Science Foundation; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; Postdoctoral Science Foundation; Science and Technology Planning Project; key lab of cloud computing and big data in Guangzhou; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6783979","Cluster ensemble;feature selection;gene expression profiles;semi-supervised clustering;tumor clustering","Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;Cancer;Clustering algorithms;Gene expression;Mutual information;Tumors","aggregation;cancer;diagnostic expert systems;feature selection;genetics;medical diagnostic computing;molecular biophysics;pattern clustering;tumours","aggregated solution selection function;binate constraint based K-means algorithm;biomolecular data;cancer diagnosis;cancer gene expression profiles;cancer treatment;consensus matrix;double feature selection based semisupervised clustering ensemble;expert knowledge;gene dimension;multiple clustering solution selection strategies;noisy genes;normalized cut algorithm;optimal subset;traditional tumor clustering approaches;tumor discovery","Algorithms;Cluster Analysis;Computational Biology;Databases, Genetic;Gene Expression Profiling;Humans;Neoplasms;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Transcriptome","16","","49","","","20140407","July-Aug. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed approach is very fast to build, very compact while remaining robust to illumination variations, rotation changes, and noise. We develop a novel and simple strategy to compute a local binary descriptor based on the conventional local binary pattern (LBP) approach, preserving the advantageous characteristics of uniform LBP. Points are sampled in a circular neighborhood, but keeping the number of bins in a single-scale LBP histogram constant and small, such that arbitrarily large circular neighborhoods can be sampled and compactly encoded over a number of scales. There is no necessity to learn a texton dictionary, as in methods based on clustering, and no tuning of parameters is required to deal with different data sets. Extensive experimental results on representative texture databases show that the proposed BRINT not only demonstrates superior performance to a number of recent state-of-the-art LBP variants under normal conditions, but also performs significantly and consistently better in presence of noise due to its high distinctiveness and robustness. This noise robustness characteristic of the proposed BRINT is evaluated quantitatively with different artificially generated types and levels of noise (including Gaussian, salt and pepper, and speckle noise) in natural texture images.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2014.2325777","Doctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6819021","Texture descriptors;feature extraction;local binary pattern (LBP);rotation invariance;texture analysis","Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Histograms;Lighting;Noise;Robustness;Vectors","Gaussian noise;image classification;image representation;image texture;visual databases","BRINT;Gaussian noise;LBP approach;binary rotation invariant texture classification;circular neighborhood;clustering;illumination variations;local binary descriptor;local binary pattern approach;natural texture images;noise tolerant texture classification;representative texture databases;rotation changes;salt-and-pepper noise;single-scale LBP histogram;speckle noise;texton dictionary","","33","","43","","","20140520","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Understanding program behavior is one of the most important factors in learning programming and in maintenance of existing programs. Here, the need exists to develop tools to facilitate understanding and to serve more than documentation and initial planning needs of a program (i.e., pseudo codes and flowcharts). In order to understand a program's behavior, a programmer needs a computer model that will execute it. Visualization has proven effective as a strategy for providing programmers and students with clearer meaning of their codes, developing and maintaining programs, and learning programming. This paper proposes a new diagrammatic methodology that produces a conceptual representation of program instructions. It can provide a foundation for understanding the behavior of running programs. The paper also reports on applying the new method to teaching an introductory university course, the results demonstrate that it improves understanding of programming and its underlying computer operations.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3188-0; POD:978-1-4799-3189-7","10.1109/ITNG.2014.74","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6822224","Visualization;conceptual representation;program visualization;programming language","Computers;Data visualization;Frequency modulation;Hardware;Programming profession;Software","computer science education;data visualisation;knowledge acquisition;software maintenance","complex process;execution visualization;knowledge acquisition;program instructions;programming knowledge development;programming statement;programs. maintenance;university course","","1","","27","","","","7-9 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The program is a structured and collegial approach where academics work together to reinvigorate their teaching practice through reflection and peer-assisted situated learning. The scheme involves colleagues collaborating to analyse existing course and teaching quality data, develop focussed development goals for curriculum and pedagogy, plan and execute strategies to achieve these goals, and monitor their effects and success during a teaching semester. The experience presented in this paper involved a paired peer relationship between two Information and Communication Technology (ICT) lecturers (colleagues) who taught disparate courses and who had separate goals. Despite the apparent dichotomy in the courses taught and the course outcomes, their experience with a small set of goals provided useful information about employing such a scheme, especially its effectiveness despite choosing simple goals. The partners were also inspired to use the scheme again and with a stronger sense of how they might prepare their goals and pursue better implementation thereof. The authors hope the experience will encourage others to adopt such a program or other similar peer assisted teaching schemes to improve teaching and learning outcomes, encourage collegial collaboration within departments, and foster engagement with learning and teaching scholarship.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3592-5; POD:978-1-4799-3593-2; USB:978-1-4799-3591-8","10.1109/LaTiCE.2014.65","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821875","Teaching innovations;best practices;experience sharing in computing and engineering education","Australia;Context;Educational institutions;Lead;Programming;Reflection","computer aided instruction;educational courses;peer-to-peer computing;teaching","ICT lecturers;collegial collaboration;disparate courses;information and communication technology;learning scholarship;peer assisted teaching program;peer assisted teaching scheme;peer relationship;peer-assisted situated learning;teaching quality data;teaching scholarship;teaching semester","","0","","8","","","","11-13 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The roadway map generation algorithm is composed of three steps, namely, data acquisition, data processing, and road modeling. In the data acquisition step, raw trajectory and motion data for map generation are acquired through exploration using a probe vehicle equipped with GPS and on-board sensors. The data processing step then processes the acquired trajectory and motion data into roadway geometry data. GPS trajectory data are unsuitable for direct roadway map use by autonomous cars due to signal interruptions and multipath; therefore, motion information from the on-board sensors is applied to refine the GPS trajectory data. A fixed-interval optimal smoothing theory is used for a refinement algorithm that can improve the accuracy, continuity, and reliability of road geometry data. Refined road geometry data are represented into the B-spline road model. A gradual correction algorithm is proposed to accurately represent road geometry with a reduced amount of control parameters. The developed map generation algorithm is verified and evaluated through experimental studies under various road geometry conditions. The results show that the generated roadway map is sufficiently accurate and reliable to utilize for autonomous driving.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2013.2291395","Energy Resource R&D program; Industrial Strategy Technology Development Program of Ministry of Knowledge Economy (MKE); Korean government (Ministry of Education, Science and Technology); MKE and Korea Institute for Advancement in Technology (KIAT) through the Workforce Development Program in Strategic Technology; Ministry of Knowledge Economy, Science and Technology through the BK21 Program; 10.13039/501100001321 - National Research Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680774","Autonomous car;B-spline;optimal smoothing;road map;road modeling","Geometry;Global Positioning System;Mathematical model;Roads;Solid modeling;Splines (mathematics);Vehicles","Global Positioning System;control engineering computing;geographic information systems;mobile robots;road vehicles;splines (mathematics);telerobotics;traffic engineering computing","B-spline road model;GPS trajectory data;autonomous cars;data acquisition;data processing;gradual correction algorithm;map generation algorithm;motion data;on-board sensors;precise roadway map generation;road geometry data;road modeling","","9","","37","","","20131211","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Among these constraints, energy conservation is the most important aspect. One of the known strategies to save energy and to prolong the lifetime of the WSNs is topology control. In this paper, a reliable energy-efficient topology control algorithm in wireless sensor networks is proposed. The proposed algorithm considers the residual energy and number of neighbors of each node for cluster formation, which is critical for well-balanced energy dissipation of the network. Knowledge-based inference approach is employed to select cluster head. Finally, reliable cluster heads are selected that maintain connectivity and coverage with respect to time. The algorithm not only balances the energy load of each node but also provides global reliability for the whole network. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively prolong the network lifetime and reduces the energy consumption.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3880-3; POD:978-1-4799-3881-0","10.1109/AIMOC.2014.6785533","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6785533","Clustering;Topology Control;Wireless Sensor Networks","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Network topology;Nickel;Protocols;Topology;Wireless sensor networks","telecommunication network topology;wireless sensor networks","cluster formation;cluster head;energy conservation;energy dissipation;energy efficient topology building algorithm;global reliability;knowledge-based inference approach;residual energy;topology control;wireless sensor networks","","0","","15","","","","Feb. 27 2014-March 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper lays down a new way to build a robust transformation parameter estimator based on the invariance constraint for remote-sensing image registration. Analogous to the two types of well-known existing transformation parameter estimation methods RANSAC and PROSAC, HTSC can serve as a new type (or the third type if we treat RANSAC and PROSAC as the first and the second types) of such methods, as it adopts the transformation-invariance information to find the consensus.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2285814","Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai Municipality of China; Research Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Committee; Science Research Program Foundation of the Shanghai Institute of Technology of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6670117","Histogram;image registration;remote sensing;robust estimation;triangle area representation (TAR)","Estimation;Feature extraction;Histograms;Image registration;Parameter estimation;Remote sensing;Robustness","affine transforms;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image matching;image registration;image representation;image sampling;parameter estimation;random processes;remote sensing","HTSC algorithm;PROSAC;RANSAC;affine transformation;feature matching strategy;histogram of TAR sample consensus;invariance constraint;progressive sample consensus;random sample consensus;remote sensing image registration algorithm;robust transformation parameter estimation algorithm;transformation invariance information;triangle area representation","","14","","48","","","20131119","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The result shows that M should be more than the product of the number of users and the number of antennas at each user. Based on the optimal number, we propose a convenient data stream allocation strategy aiming to improve the system sum rate, meanwhile maintaining the number of simultaneously served users.

"Art museums, mobile media and education: A new way to explain art?","V. L. Benito","Sch. of Educ., Univ. of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain","2013 Digital Heritage International Congress (DigitalHeritage)","20140220","2013","1","","767","767","Summary form only given. The content of this paper forms part of a wider research on the educational possibilities of mobile media in art museums. Currently, museums are changing their relationship with the public based on the availability of Web 2.0 and new information and communication technologies, particularly the mobile media, involving the use of tablets and smartphones. New ways of communication have been developed by museums and users are invited to contribute to museum contents with their own contributions as well as museums reach out to new audiences through the new media. However, if we focus on a systematic analysis of mobile apps for museums, one of the more rapidly expanding mobile resources, we would like to determine whether educational function is one of the aims of these resources. Moreover, we would also like to find out whether the learning strategies developed to explain art are different than the strategies employed in art museums so far. These kinds of mobile resources provide a wide range of educational strategies not always used to engage art museums audiences. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to reveal the results of the analysis of mobile Apps designed by Art Museums in the Spanish context in order to determine whether they have become a valuable educational resource and to explore what type of learning strategies they have been developed through these technologies to explain art to a wider audience. Firstly, five Apps have been analyzed for this paper: Guggenheim Museum App, the Picasso Museum of Barcelona App, Reina Sofía Museum App, Thyssen Museum App Prado Museum App. The criteria to select this sample were on one hand, the Apps are about the collection and permanent exhibition of the museums and on the other hand, the Apps must be mobile applications not mobile audioguide or Web mobile. Secondly, the Apps have been analyzed by an analysis sheet designed previously for the research. This analysis sheet has two sections. Th- first one is a descriptive analysis which includes different categories such as country, year publication, category of Art Museum, devices (Smartphones, Tablets or both). Also whether Internet connection is needed, whether the App is free or not and which OS is used (iOS, Android or both). The descriptive analysis also include the context of use related to the museum visit (before, during or independent of the visit), the type of application as well as the target audience. The second section of the analysis sheet evaluates the educational factor of the applications according to several categories. In this case, the categories are the type of content, the type of learning strategies, aims, and resources like images, videos, social media, AR, etc. The outcomes of the descriptive analysis have been analyzed using descriptive statistics technics. Otherwise, the second section, educational factor, is not only a descriptive analysis, but an assessment analysis to determinate whether the Apps could be a valuable educational resource. To assess the educational factor each item of the categories has been coded with a number (1= low, 2= medium and 3= high). As result of this codification process there are five categories to evaluate the educational factor: (1= low, between 1 and 2= medium-low, 2= medium, between 2 and 3= medium-high, 3=high). According to the assessment of the educational factor of the five Mobile Apps selected for this paper, the outcomes reveal that the educational factor are low in the case of Prado Museum App, medium-low in the case of Guggenheim Museum App, the Picasso Museum of Barcelona App, Reina Sofía Museum App. And Thyssen Museum App is the unique App whose educational factor is medium-high. To conclude, it is possible to state that the answer to the title, Art Museums, Mobile Media: a new way to explain art?, would be negative in the case of the Apps of theses Spanish Art Museums. There is a change in the medium but not in the message.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3170-5; POD:978-1-4799-3171-2; USB:978-1-4799-3169-9","10.1109/DigitalHeritage.2013.6743840","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6743840","Art Museums;Digital Curation;Education;Mobile Apps","","Internet;art;computer aided instruction;mobile computing;museums","Guggenheim Museum App;Internet connection;Picasso Museum of Barcelona App;Prado Museum App;Reina Sofía Museum App;Spanish art museums;Thyssen Museum App;Web 2.0;art museum audiences;assessment analysis;descriptive analysis;descriptive statistics;educational factor;educational resource;educational strategies;information and communication technologies;learning strategies;mobile Apps;mobile applications;mobile media;mobile resources;museum visit;smartphones;tablets","","0","","","","","","Oct. 28 2013-Nov. 1 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The problem is that non IS students are not knowledgeable of computer hardware and software and would struggle. A quantitative research approach was used for this study. The findings from this study depicted that factors influencing students choice from not taking or going into IS/IT field of study were related to higher salary and lower level of computer literacy.

Previous research has shown that using LOs to supplement traditional lecture increases achievement and promotes success for college students in the disciplines of engineering and computer science. The computer-based nature for LOs allows for sophisticated tracking that can collect metadata about the individual learners. This tends to result in a tremendous amount of metadata collected on LOs. The challenge becomes identifying the predictors of learning. Previous research tends to be focused on a single area of metadata such as the learning strategies or demographic variables. Here we report on a comprehensive regression analysis conducted on variables in four widely different areas including LO interaction data, MSLQ survey responses (that measure learning strategies), demographic information, and LO evaluation survey data. Our analysis found that a subset of the variables in each area were actually significant predictors of learning. We also found that several static variables that appeared to be significant predictors in their own right were simply reflecting the results from student motivation. These results provide valuable insights into which variables are significant predictors.

Although much progress has been made, challenges remain, especially when the 3D structures of target proteins are not available or no homology templates can be found in the library, where the template-based methods are hard to be applied. In this paper, we report a new ligand-specific template-free predictor called TargetS for targeting protein-ligand binding sites from primary sequences. TargetS first predicts the binding residues along the sequence with ligand-specific strategy and then further identifies the binding sites from the predicted binding residues through a recursive spatial clustering algorithm. Protein evolutionary information, predicted protein secondary structure, and ligand-specific binding propensities of residues are combined to construct discriminative features; an improved AdaBoost classifier ensemble scheme based on random undersampling is proposed to deal with the serious imbalance problem between positive (binding) and negative (nonbinding) samples. Experimental results demonstrate that TargetS achieves high performances and outperforms many existing predictors.

In this paper author digs deeper into the factors associated with resilience and different approaches to learn resilience. Psychologists have identified some of the factors that make someone resilient, among them a positive attitude, optimism, the ability to regulate emotions, and the ability to see failure as a form of helpful feedback. Even after a misfortune, blessed with such an outlook, resilient people are able to change course and soldier on. In this paper the author includes case studies with real life examples of people to be knocked down by life and come back stronger than ever. This then brings us to the question: Can resilience be measured and taught? Martin Seligman (2011) in his article on Building Resilience in The Magazine of Harvard Business Review discussed that over the years of research how we have learned not only how to distinguish those who will grow after failure from those who will collapse, but also how to build the skills of people in the latter category. Author describes the strategies and procedure for scenario based learning environment design using which it is possible to teach the techniques to foster resilience, for example, to have sense of purpose in life, to be optimistic, to develop a strong social network, to embrace change, to establish goals, to develop problem solving and self nurturance skills.

Mobile applications, text messaging and wireless networks open devices up to attack. Despite security risks mobile technologies have been reported to be instrumental in reshaping tertiary education in developing countries. While mobile security threats are a concern and mobile technologies' potential to boost productivity in Higher education increases, little has been done to assess the impact of mobile security risks against utilization of hand-held technologies for learning. This paper argues that mobile security risks have a significant impact on mobile learning adoption.

Intelligent search in those communities may support users to obtain their own needed information. As other social networks there are different types of entities in a learning community, such as learning materials, `similar' persons, learning groups, tags. Accordingly there may be different relationships among them. We argue that those data can be accurately modeled by heterogeneous networks, and explore unified intelligent search that incorporates different types of entities using a spreading activation approach. We propose ISC-Search, which provides users with three types of search possibilities/strategies, in addition to the traditional one, and give them choices to fit their own information needs. These different search strategies leverage social data and content data in different ways to satisfy users' needs. They are (1) Intelligent search, which finds the relevant entities of different types in an online learning community; (2) Social first search, which searches first by social relationships; (3) Content first search, which finds the relevant entities first by content; (4) traditional search, which focuses on the search words themselves. We developed and implemented these search strategies for the online teaching and learning community expertAzubi, and compared these different search strategies in an experiment.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5094-5; POD:978-1-4673-5095-2","10.1109/ICeLeTE.2013.6644343","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644343","","Communities;Context;Educational institutions;Materials;Search problems;Social network services","computer aided instruction;information retrieval;social networking (online)","ISC-Search;community members;content data;content first search;expertAzubi;intelligent search;learning groups;learning materials;learning outcome;online learning communities;search strategies;social data;social first search;social networks;spreading activation approach;unified intelligent search","","0","","31","","","","23-25 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Pad Phone, a disruptive innovative consumer electronic device integrating both a tablet personal computer (PC) as well as a smart phone, is a typical disruptive innovative device which consumer behaviors are difficult to predict based on mass customers' opinions. In order to derive key factors influencing users' acceptance of Pad Phones, the second generation Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) will be introduced as the theoretic framework. Based on opinions being derived from lead users, the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) based Network Process (DNP) will be introduced for constructing the influence s between the factors in UTAUT2; and then, weights being associated with the factors can be derived accordingly. Based on the empirical study results, the social influence plays the dominant role in facilitating conditions. The habit and hedonic motivation are essential factors influencing customers' acceptances of Pad Phones. The empirical study results can serve as a basis for R&D and marketing strategy definitions for IT companies.

Firstly, we combine the proactive and reactive opportunistic relaying by employing specific LLR switching thresholds, according to which the best relay and the corresponding transmission mode are selected dynamically. The approximate closed-form bit error rate (BER) expression is derived with the assumption that only one relay exists, and then the thresholds are optimized accordingly, which can be calculated in distributed manner with low complexity. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can efficiently avoid error propagation and outperform conventional scheme.

Military plays an important role in the emergence of Smart Society today. Using advanced ICT for accomplishing military tasks in advanced countries is a common, but that matter is not the same in military society in developing countries such as Indonesia. Therefore there is a need to define the proper characteristics for a military service so that it can be declared as Smart Military Society. On the other hand, the characteristics of Smart Society itself are not unified yet. In this paper, the characteristics of Smart Military Society are proposed by adopting, in some respects, a method used to score Smart City. Because of its unique nature and tasks, one new characteristic called Smart Defense which consists of four factors namely intelligence, weapon system, decision-making cycle, and interoperability, is added. Based on the comprehensive assessment, it is proposed seven characteristics with 26 factors that can be used to score and rank military services, and show if they are eligible to be called as Smart Military Society.

However, this assumption may be invalid in many practical scenarios. In this paper, we address the resource allocation problem with incomplete information where the realized mean opinion score (MOS) can only be observed over time, but the underlying QoE model and playout time are unknown. We consider two variants of this problem: 1) the form of the QoE model is known but the parameters are unknown; 2) both the form and the parameters of the QoE model are unknown. For both cases, we develop dynamic resource allocation schemes based on online test-optimization strategy. Simply speaking, one first spends appropriate time on testing the QoE model, then optimizes the sum of the MOS in the remaining playout time. The highlight of this paper lies in resolving the inherent tension between the test and optimization by jointly considering the uncertainties of QoE model and playout time. Furthermore, we derive tight bounds on the MOS loss incurred by the proposed schemes in comparison with the optimal scheme that knows the QoE model a priori and prove that the performance gap, as the playout time tends to infinity, asymptotically shrinks to zero.","1536-1276;15361276","","10.1109/TWC.2013.051413.120597","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6517785","QoE;Resource allocation;incomplete information;multimedia communications;test-optimization","","multimedia communication;optimisation;quality of experience;resource allocation","QoE-driven multimedia communication;dynamic resource allocation;mean opinion score;multimedia playout;online test-optimization strategy;quality of experience","","33","","25","","","20130521","August 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Electronic collaboration systems are more and more used in the domain of research community, for education systems and in societies to insure the collaboration between employees. We note also that the use of social networks continues to increase: Facebook and Twitter are very known examples of electronic collaboration. But, these systems are faced with a big security challenge. In fact, they are exposed to malicious intrusions, identity usurpation and data falsification. Those security problems are a barrier for electronic collaboration, that's why Trust management must be established to insure and maintain cooperation between distributed nodes. In this paper, we propose a model that can be applicable for any collaborative platform. It is based on a multi level architecture: authentication, analysis, security and monitoring levels. Each level is managed by agents. Each access to the collaborative platform must be controlled by an authentication agent. Analysis agent must identify collaboration type and estimate trust level. Security agents decide then if collaboration can take place. Decisions are taken following a Case Based Reasoning method. During collaboration, monitoring agents check any malicious behavior.","1524-4547;15244547","Electronic:978-0-7695-5002-2; POD:978-1-4799-0405-1","10.1109/WETICE.2013.80","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6570619","","Authentication;Cognition;Collaboration;Databases;Monitoring;Peer-to-peer computing","authorisation;case-based reasoning;decision making;groupware;social networking (online);trusted computing","Facebook;Twitter;agent-based model;authentication agent;case based reasoning method;collaborative platform;collaborative work;communication and information technologies;data falsification;distributed nodes;education systems;electronic collaboration systems;identity usurpation;malicious intrusions;monitoring agents;multilevel architecture;research community;social networks;trust level estimation;trust management","","1","","15","","","","17-20 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this new paradigm, efficient data transmission between the cloud and mobile devices becomes essential. This, however, is highly unreliable and unpredictable due to several uncontrollable factors, particularly the instability and intermittency of wireless connections, fluctuation of communication bandwidth, and user mobility. Consequently, this puts a heavy burden on the energy consumption of mobile devices. Confirmed by our experiments, significantly more energy is consumed during “bad” connectivity. Inspired by the feasibility to schedule data transmissions for prefetching-friendly or delay-tolerant applications, in this paper, we present eTime, a novel Energy-efficient data Transmission strategy between cloud and Mobile dEvices, based on Lyapunov optimization. It aggressively and adaptively seizes the timing of good connectivity to prefetch frequently used data while deferring delay-tolerant data in bad connectivity. To cope with the randomness and unpredictability of wireless connectivity, eTime only relies on the current status information to make a global energy-delay tradeoff decision. Our evaluations from both trace-driven simulation and realworld implementation show that eTime can be applied to various popular applications while achieving 20%-35% energy saving.","0743-166X;0743166X","Electronic:978-1-4673-5946-7; POD:978-1-4673-5944-3","10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6566762","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6566762","","Bandwidth;Data communication;Energy consumption;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Mobile communication;Smart phones","cloud computing;delay tolerant networks;energy conservation;mobile computing;optimisation;radio networks","Lyapunov optimization;bad connectivity;communication bandwidth;computing paradigm;data transmissions;delay-tolerant applications;delay-tolerant data;eTime;energy consumption;energy-efficient data transmission strategy;energy-efficient transmission;frequently used data;global energy-delay tradeoff decision;mobile cloud computing;realworld implementation;resource-constrained mobile devices;status information;trace-driven simulation;user mobility;wireless connections;wireless connectivity","","40","","12","","","","14-19 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The tool that groups the set of games is called ACoTI (Augmentative Communication through Tangible Interaction). ACoTI proposes that students, by using conventional toys, interact with the computer to perform various simple and complex association activities. Thus, the focus is to train and develop abstraction processes that favor the communication between the individual and his/her environment. In this case, toys have two essential roles: on the one hand, they act as mediators for individual-computer interaction, and on the other, they help to train students in the abstraction processes required for developing communicational skills. A detailed description of ACoTI is included in this paper, as well as the field work carried out to support its design and implementation, and the assessments carried out to validate both the application and its interaction mode.

In recent years, the remote detection of the C-PC concentrations for inland waters has received much attention. However, their accurate quantification by means of remote sensing is still a challenge due to the significant bio-optical complexity of turbid inland waters. In this paper, three typical turbid inland lakes in China were investigated through in situ observed data sets containing optical and water quality parameters. By using a recently proposed <i>TD</i>680 optical classification method, all collected samples were first classified into three types. For each type of water, we determined specific spectral sensitive regions for the pigment C-PC. Then, we developed three type-specific support vector regression (SVR) algorithms and an aggregated SVR algorithm. The performances of these algorithms were evaluated through the validation data sets. The results show that the type-specific algorithms generally have significantly improved performance over the aggregated SVR algorithm. Their assessment errors [mean absolute percentage error (<i>MAPE</i>) and root-mean-square error ( <i>rmse</i>)] were as follows: 1) <i>MAPE</i> = 15.6% and <i>rmse</i> = 30.6 mg·m<sup>-3</sup> for Type 1 water; 2) <i>MAPE</i> = 47.1% and <i>rmse</i> = 61.5 mg·m<sup>-3</sup> for Type 2 water; and 3) <i>MAPE</i> = 26.4% and <i>rmse</i> = 19.1 mg·m<sup>-3</sup> for Type 3 water. The findings in this paper demonstrate that a prior water classification is needed for the development of accurate C-PC retrieval algorithms. This paper provides a valid strategy for improving C-PC estimation accuracy and enhancing algorithm commonality for optically complex turbid waters.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2227976","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6423281","Optically complex turbid waters;pigment C-phycocyanin (C-PC);type-specific algorithm;water classification","Absorption;Adaptive optics;Biomedical optical imaging;Lakes;Optical sensors;Remote sensing;Water","geophysical signal processing;lakes;microorganisms;regression analysis;remote sensing;support vector machines","C-PC retrieval algorithm;China;animal ecosystem health;aquatic ecosystem health;biooptical complexity;cyanobacteria;human ecosystem health;hyperspectral remote sensing;lakes;optical classification;phytoplankton group;pigment C-phycocyanin;support vector regression;turbid inland water","","8","","74","","","20130129","July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Crucial to successful mastery is the development of discipline specific cognitive and metacognitive skills, including self-regulation. We can assist our students in the process of reflection and self-regulation by identifying and articulating successful self-regulated learning strategies for specific discipline contexts. However, in order to do so, we must develop an understanding of those discipline specific strategies that can be successful and readily adopted by students, and ways of understanding and articulating successful mental models. In this paper, we explore a Neo-Piagetian analysis of students' reflections upon their software development processes, enabling us to identify mental models for software development. We adopt a case study approach, identifying key examples of pre-operational behaviours that rely upon self-regulated learning strategies in place of articulated mental models, through to formal operational behaviours exhibiting complex, multi-relationship models of software development and design activities.

Accordingly, universities will need to change their curriculums and educational environments in order to teach advanced information and communication technology to students. Educational organizations such as universities need to provide an educational cloud for use by students. We are constructing a private educational cloud based on the Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud. The most important feature of our cloud is super-saturation, which is defined as allocating more logical resources than the available physical resources. A supersaturated cloud can execute more than 10 times the number of instances than a conventional cloud. In order to maximize the performance of a supersaturated cloud, tasks must continuously be provided to the cloud. However, the demand on grids has been reduced because of energy saving. Thus, the grid and cloud are complementary technologies in that the cloud consumes tasks produced by the grid. In this paper, we propose a method for constructing a Grid on Cloud to solve this issue. We compare two methods, the single large instance strategy (SLIS) and multiple small instance strategy. We conclude that the SLIS based instance grid method is the best if the system load is shared by all instances.","1550-445X;1550445X","Electronic:978-0-7695-4953-8; POD:978-1-4673-5550-6","10.1109/AINA.2013.71","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6531758","cloud computing;educational cloud;grid","Business;Cloud computing;Clouds;Educational institutions;Memory management;Servers","cloud computing;computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;grid computing;resource allocation;software performance evaluation;teaching","SLIS based instance grid method;Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud;advanced information and communication technology;cloud computing;cloud skills;curriculums;educational environments;energy saving;logical resource allocation;multiple small instance strategy;physical resources;private educational cloud;single large instance strategy;supersaturated cloud performance;system load;teaching","","2","","17","","","","25-28 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, information security topics are challenging to teach in traditional computer laboratories mainly due to restrictive information technology policies. In recent decades, virtual computing has become a promising solution to address the challenges of providing students with hands-on learning experiences in information security. While the literature mainly focuses on technical aspects of virtual computer laboratories and provides ample examples about how they can be used in information security courses, there is a lack of pedagogical studies. We introduce a framework based on Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle to design activities for virtual computer laboratories.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the current state of support and success of these knowledge maturing activities and to contrast them with their perceived importance, to identify those which have the highest potential for being supported by ICT. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through telephone interviews with representatives from 126 organizations throughout Europe in a sample stratified according to size, sector, and knowledge-intensity. The activities that appear to be most promising are “reflecting on and refining work practices and processes,” “finding people with particular knowledge or expertise,” as well as “assessing, verifying, and rating information.” Rich empirical material about how these activities are performed and also the issues that emerged and need to be managed were collected.

Since the current research of superposition coding for Wyner-Ziv problem only remains in theory, we design a practical CF scheme in half-duplex mode by using the technique of superposition coding and provide specific coding strategy for it. The relay compresses the received signal by the quantization method based on superposition coding, and then the destination performs a joint decoding to recover the original message.

In this paper, we propose a lightweight geocast-based piggybacking mechanism for cooperative awareness applications in VANET. We leverage only one-hop beacons to construct both local and extended traffic views for drivers. Since multi-hop communication does not scale well, consequently our proposed scheme only exploits single-hop beacons to provide the same comparable functionality as multi-hop communication would do. The goal is achieved at the expense of a small piece of additional information (traffic classes) in the scheduled beacons. Geocast-based piggybacking has a twofold advantage over traditional flooding-based approaches; it serves as virtual multi-hop communication paradigm and it avoids broadcast storm problem.","2158-3994;21583994","Electronic:978-1-4673-1363-6; POD:978-1-4673-1361-2","10.1109/ICCE.2013.6487041","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487041","","Broadcasting;Conferences;Information systems;Spread spectrum communication;Storms;Vehicles;Vehicular ad hoc networks","cooperative communication;safety;traffic information systems;vehicular ad hoc networks","VANET system;broadcast storm problem;cooperative awareness application;drivers;extended traffic views;flooding-based approach;lightweight geocast-based piggybacking strategy;multihop communication;safe driving;traffic information system;vehicular ad hoc network system","","3","","4","","","","11-14 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

PhN is further comprised of an ad hoc network and a base station-based (BS-based) network. SaN and PhN are overlapping in the same deployment region, operate on the same spectrum, but are independent with each other in terms of communication requirements. The primary users (PUs), i.e., the ad hoc nodes in PhN, have the priority to access the spectrum. The secondary users (SUs), i.e., the ad hoc nodes in SaN, are equipped with cognitive radios, and have the functionalities to sense the idle spectrum and obtain the necessary information of primary nodes in PhN. We assume that PhN adopts one out of three classical types of strategies, i.e., pure ad hoc strategy, BS-based strategy, and hybrid strategy. We aim to directly derive multicast capacity for SaN to unify the unicast and broadcast capacities under two basic principles: 1) The throughput for PhN cannot be undermined in order sense due to the presence of SaN. 2) The protocol adopted by PhN does not alter in the interest of SaN, anyway. Depending on which type of strategy is adopted in PhN, we design the optimal-throughput strategy for SaN. We show that there exists a threshold of the density of SUs according to the density of PUs beyond which it can be proven that: 1) when PhN adopts the pure ad hoc strategy or hybrid strategy, SaN can achieve the multicast capacity of the same order as it is stand-alone; 2) when PhN adopts the BS-based strategy, SaN can asymptotically achieve the multicast capacity of the same order as if PhN were absent, if some specific conditions in terms of relations among the numbers of SUs, PUs, the destinations of each multicast session in SaN, and BSs in PhN hold.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2012.219","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6247428","Cognitive networks;hybrid networks;multicast capacity;percolation theory;random networks","Ad hoc networks;Interference;Protocols;Road transportation;Routing;Throughput;Upper bound","","","","2","","32","","","20120723","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This classical or traditional approach continuously requires big investments on laboratory equipment and significant space requirements. Moreover, it obliges students to be physically present in the laboratory to complete their experiments. The lab instructor is also present to help them with their needs or to answer their specific questions related to the experiments. With the evolution of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and electronic circuit board technologies, further possibilities even include to bring the laboratory at home (Lab@home). This philosophy can be achieved with the advantages of miniaturized and low cost equipment and facilities, complemented with the student's already available personal computers. Available miniature kits include basic electronics for the generation and processing of various types of signals. The personal computer coupled with the kit, acts as a set of signal injecting and measuring devices. Pedagogical strategies to encourage team collaborative work, ensuring simultaneous information exchanges between the students themselves and with the laboratory instructor can be elaborated specifically for this innovative setup. This recent approach can be used to help enforce the knowledge and competence of the students, allowing them to develop their autonomy, their creativity and thus develop their ability to innovate.

In this paper, we built a new energy consumption model by adding the intra-body channel which has a tremendous path loss into traditional energy model of the Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). By modeling local transmission channel with intra-body channel mostly studied in Body Area Networks (BAN), we first prove that cooperative MIMO can be adopted to reduce the total energy consumption compared with traditional single-input-single-output (SISO) scheme while transmission distance is larger than a threshold. Furthermore, we proposed a cooperative strategy based on the model from two aspects, the selection principle of the Cooperative Node and the joint optimization of modulation constellation size and Cooperative Node number. By introducing the cooperative strategy into our new energy model, the total energy consumption is tremendously decreased and the threshold is reduced accordingly.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1157-1; POD:978-1-4673-1156-4; USB:978-1-4673-1155-7","10.1109/ISCIT.2012.6380987","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6380987","Cooperative MIMO Strategy;Energy Model;Energy-efficiency;Intra-body Channel;Wireless Sensor Networks","Energy consumption;Integrated circuit modeling;MIMO;Modulation;Propagation losses;Receivers;Wireless sensor networks","MIMO communication;body area networks;cooperative communication;energy consumption;optimisation;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","BAN;SISO scheme;WSN;body area networks;energy consumption model;energy limited nodes;energy saving;energy-efficient cooperative MIMO strategy;intrabody channel;local transmission channel;multiinput-multioutput technique;single-input-single-output scheme;wireless sensor networks","","0","","14","","","","2-5 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The evolutionary equilibrium is considered to be the solution of the game, where finally all the users are able to achieve an identical payoff. The proposed method incorporates QoE mapping functions used for modeling diverse quality requirements, and also adopts distinct energy consumption metrics for various applications. To cope with the significant energy consumption of terminals in heterogeneous networks, we give an energy efficient payoff model for network selection. Users will obtain lower payoff when accessing networks that need more transmit power, so that more users tend to access networks with lower energy consumption to increase user satisfaction. Simulation results prove that the proposed energy efficient algorithm based on QoE (EEAQ) outperforms the existing ones regarding energy consumption.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1157-1; POD:978-1-4673-1156-4; USB:978-1-4673-1155-7","10.1109/ISCIT.2012.6381021","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6381021","","Energy consumption;Games;Real-time systems;Sociology;Statistics;Wireless LAN;Wireless communication","energy consumption;evolutionary computation;quality of experience;quality of service","EEAQ;QoE mapping function;QoE-aware method;energy consumption metrics;energy efficient network selection;energy efficient payoff model;evolutionary equilibrium;evolutionary game;quality of experience","","0","","14","","","","2-5 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, in addition to the traditional Kullback-Leibler Divergence, a phoneme similarity measure: AMD, which take articulation difference into account, is proposed to get the similarity between phonemes. Finally, a perception-based phoneme mapping strategy is implemented to increase the mapping accuracy between Mandarin and English phonemes.

Finally, the paper discusses the challenges faced along the implementation process and provides an overview of lessons learnt. This paper observes that if used effectively, eLearning can enhance ubiquity, equity and quality in medical education and the development of appropriate skills in the developing countries' medical care systems. The paper suggests that in order to improve the quality of medical education under limited resource settings, universities in developing countries should effectively make use of innovative and emerging technologies which are relevant to their respective environments. A successful implementation of eLearning requires a strategic approach which should be embedded by the university management, academic staff and students.

In a similar vein, smart digital technologies, mainly Web 2.0 platforms, become increasingly a new user-friendly vehicle to identify, acquire, transform and exploit new knowledge and information. Despite the presence of more research stressing the importance of knowledge brokering, mainly in the public health sector, little is still known about knowledge brokers, their profession or their day-to-day activities, particularly in regard to their use of Web 2.0 technologies. This article goes beyond rhetoric and hermeneutic analyses on this subject to draw an empirical and factual overview of emerging practices and strategies in knowledge brokering, within government agencies.

How can we influence the outcome? This action-oriented book identifies the key issues, explores the evidence, and suggests some answers. Avoiding both utopianism and despair, the book presents the voices of technology enthusiasts and skeptics, as well as social activists.The book is organized into three parts. Part I examines the issues in their socio-technical, economic, and historical contexts. Part II--the core of the book--proposes five initiatives for using computers and electronic communications to benefit low-income urban communities:- to provide access to the new technologies in ways that enable low-income people to become active producers rather than passive users;- to use the new technologies to improve the dialogue between public agencies and low-income neighborhoods;- to help low-income youth to exploit the entrepreneurial potential of information technologies;- to develop approaches to education that take advantage of the educational capabilities of the computer;- to promote the community computer: applications of computers and communications technology that foster community development.Part III presents a synthesis of the various topics. Its main questions are, What are the prospects and problems of initiatives to enable the poor to benefit from the new technologies? and What federal, state, and municipal policies would enhance the prospects for success?Contributors : Alice Amsden, Jeanne Bamberger, Anne Beamish, Manuel Castells, Joseph Ferreira, Peter Hall, Leo Marx, William J.

The classification of physical activities for EER model construction is based on the acceleration and ECG signal data collected by wearable sensor modules developed by our research lab. The proposed algorithm consists of procedures for data collection, data preprocessing, activity classification, feature selection, and construction of EER models using neural networks. In order to reduce the computational load and achieve satisfactory estimation performance, we employed sequential forward and backward search strategies for feature selection. Two representative neural networks, a radial basis function network (RBFN) and a generalized regression neural network (GRNN), were employed as EER models for performance comparisons.

Therefore, pervasive applications need a middleware that can detect and act upon any context changes created by the result of any interactions between users, applications, and surrounding computing environment for applications without users, interventions. To achieve this goal, one of the problems is how to continuously monitor/capture and interpret the environment related information efficiently to assure high context awareness by the middleware. Many attentions have been paid to the research of the context-aware pervasive applications. Existing context information that supports service (component) adaptations is provided by the context-aware infrastructure, which gathers, pre-processes and provisions context information from a variety of context information sources. However, the context-aware applications is usually prone to failures and disconnections that negatively impact on the ability of them to adapt (and therefore dramatically impact on their usability). So we should take the Quality of Context (QoC) into account. And the procession of gathering, pre-processing and providing context information must be autonomic to the end users. Therefore, we propose an autonomic quality management middleware to support QoC management based context provision. By this middleware, we can configure different strategies to refinery raw context, discard duplicate and inconsistent context adaptively so as to protect and provide QoS-enriched context information of users to context-aware applications and services.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-0242-5; POD:978-1-4673-0241-8","10.1109/ICCSE.2012.6295288","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6295288","Agent;Context-aware;Pervasive;QoC;middleware","Cognition;Computers;Context;Context-aware services;Middleware;Sensors","middleware;mobile computing;quality of service","QoS-enriched context information;autonomic context processing;autonomic quality management middleware;context awareness;context-aware pervasive applications;distributed mobile computing;environment related information;information technology;refinery raw context","","1","","13","","","","14-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

AV shunts are surgically created pathological-physiological fistulas serving as access routes for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. The distinct and periodic bruit of vascular shunts is clearly audible over the access routes. Thus, a bruit spectral analysis could be considered a valuable noninvasive method for quantifying the severity of vessel stenosis. This study collected phonoangiographic data from thirty AV shunts obtained from the electronic stethoscope during the pre- and post-percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) periods. An autoregressive (AR) model was applied to scientifically analyze the phonoangiographic signals. The AR model and the filter order of eight were chosen to estimate the characteristic frequency of the bruit. The AR model results obtained from the analysis of the phonoangiographic data under the pre-PTA and post-PTA conditions show significant changes in frequency and magnitude. These findings could serve as a noninvasive strategy for early detection of stenotic lesions.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2108-2; POD:978-1-4673-2109-9","10.1109/ITiME.2012.6291369","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6291369","AVS Stenosis;Arteriovenous Shunt (AVS);Burg Method;Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA);Phono-angiographic Signal","Biomedical monitoring;Computational modeling;MATLAB;Mathematical model;Monitoring;Time frequency analysis","autoregressive processes;biomedical MRI;medical signal processing","AV shunts;AVS;ESRD patients;arteriovenous shunt stenosis;autoregressive modeling;bruit spectral analysis;burg method;electronic stethoscope;end-stage renal disease patients;hemodialysis patients;noninvasive strategy;pathological-physiological fistulas;phonoangiographic data;post-percutaneous transluminal angioplasty periods;pre-percutaneous transluminal angioplasty periods;signal processing method;stenotic lesions","","0","","19","","","","3-5 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the latter one, when will the remanufacturer source from the backup supplier is the key issue. In this paper, we will focus on the sourcing time for the remanufacturer of reverse supply chain when a supply disruption occurs. First, the stock-flow diagram with supply disruption of the reverse supply chain is presented by Vensim<sup>®</sup> 5.10. Second, the simulation results of the remanufacturer's profit under different supply disruption periods are shown. Then, by analyzing the simulation results, the strategy for sourcing time can be decided according to the remanufacturer's profit.

Classified into different typical elements, a traffic road network can be expressed as a matrix. Taking crosses and their links as basic research objects, the proposed prediction method can only use a few real traffic parameters obtained from loop detectors to realize accurate short-term prediction of traffic flow rate. This method can also be adaptable to different kinds of road network. In case study, the real traffic system is simulated with the microscopic traffic simulation platform (CORSIM).

The hybridization between DE and PSO represents a promising way to create more powerful optimizers, especially for specific problem solving. In the past decade, numerous hybrids of DE and PSO have emerged with diverse design ideas from many researchers. This paper attempts to comprehensively review the existing hybrids based on DE and PSO with the goal of collection of different ideas to build a systematic taxonomy of hybridization strategies. Taking into account five hybridization factors, i.e., the relationship between parent optimizers, hybridization level, operating order (OO), type of information transfer (TIT), and type of transferred information (TTI), we propose several classification mechanisms and a versatile taxonomy to differentiate and analyze various hybridization strategies. A large number of hybrids, which include the hybrids of DE and PSO and several other representative hybrids, are categorized according to the taxonomy. The taxonomy can be utilized not only as a tool to identify different hybridization strategies, but also as a reference to design hybrid optimizers. The tradeoff between exploration and exploitation regarding hybridization design is discussed and highlighted. Based on the taxonomy proposed, this paper also indicates several promising lines of research that are worthy of devotion in future.","1094-6977;10946977","","10.1109/TSMCC.2011.2160941","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5977033","Differential evolution (DE);evolutionary optimization;exploration and exploitation;hybridization strategies;memetic algorithms (MAs);particle swarm optimization (PSO);population-based metaheuristics;taxonomy","Algorithm design and analysis;Optimization;Particle swarm optimization;Taxonomy;Topology","evolutionary computation;particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification","DE;OO;PSO;TIT;TTI;classification mechanisms;differential evolution;hybridization level;hybridization strategy taxonomy;operating order;parent optimizers;particle swarm optimization;population-based optimizer design;scientific-engineering research;type of information transfer;type of transferred information","","58","","164","","","20110808","Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The article discusses planning and implementation of distance learning in the HEI teaching process in connection with human, informational, and financial resources. The relevance of this study is determined not only by the need to have a tool for making decisions on the implementation of specific training programs but also allows to make transparent the core business process of the University and to show the interest of the academic staff in the mechanism and in the implementation of the customer-oriented strategy of the University. The suggested model is based on the calculation of payment for teaching, for the work on the creation of training materials and payment of tutors in distance education and on some most significant parameters of the programs' implementation process. These parameters can be either the number of students enrolled in the program or the number of ECTS credit points achieved by students in a semester or other. All of them are calculated with the use of the actual curricula for particular programs. The model allows calculating both the projected revenues and the expenses on individual items. This allows us to assess administrative decisions on the optimization of the structure of the program and the implementation of the training plans. The model has been successfully tested on four vital academic programs at Transport and Telecommunication Institute. The model and the proposed method of its application fully comply with the principles of the Bologna process and can be easily transformed for use at any European HEI.","","DVD:978-953-233-072-4; Electronic:978-953-233-068-7; POD:978-1-4673-2577-6","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240866","","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Computer aided instruction;Educational institutions;Remuneration;Training","business process re-engineering;distance learning;further education;information resources;optimisation;planning;simulation;teaching;training","ECTS credits;HEI;Transport and Telecommunication Institute;academic programs;business process;customer-oriented strategy;decision making;distance education;distance learning planning;financial resources;higher educational institution;human resources;informational resources;optimization;payment calculation;simulation model;teaching;training materials;training programs","","1","","3","","","","21-25 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Students of these courses had to interact, in order to produce a prototype of a smart grids system, simulating a real project development. At the end, a survey among students has proved that the integration of practical exercises has provided higher levels of understanding and problem solving capabilities, improving students' knowledge. The survey also has shown that communication between students from different courses should be improved. The major findings of this paper were that the integration of the three courses was favorable by 83% of the surveyed students, and most students (73%) have considered that their knowledge was improved.

As a result, the higher education community is collecting and disseminating a great deal of data that is typically used to benchmark performance or satisfy reporting requirements. This data is a rich source for scholarly inquiry, and particularly interesting for questions related to investment strategies within the academy. However, the real value of these data sets can often only realized when the data is viewed and studied across the aggregate collection of data sources. This is a complex task that requires gathering, cleaning, and applying consistent metadata standards to data sets. This paper presents a Unified Data Framework that allows the aggregation of high demand data sources into a single useful research resource that is relevant to research in higher education. The Unified Data Framework guides the aggregation of existing and new data sets, and provides the option of connecting and automatically, or semi-automatically, updating data from the original sources. The Unified Data Framework presents to researchers of higher education a robust suite of analytic tools for data mining and visualization of combined and complex data sources.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4654-4; POD:978-1-4673-0798-7","10.1109/ITNG.2012.151","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6209086","aggregation of institutional data;data consolidation;data framework;data interoperability","Awards activities;Data mining;Databases;Educational institutions;Standards;Supercomputers","computer aided instruction;data acquisition;data mining;data visualisation;further education;information dissemination;investment;meta data","U.S. higher education;data collection;data dissemination;data mining;data sets;data source aggregation;data visualization;investment strategy;meta data standard;unified data framework","","1","","19","","","","16-18 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We then formulate a joint subcarrier and power allocation issue and find that it has high complexity. Hence, we first distribute subcarriers and propose proportional allocation strategy to achieve tradeoff between fairness and QoS. Next, an iterative water-filling power allocation is proposed to fully utilize the limited power. To further decrease complexity, fixed power iterative scheme is introduced. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme greatly improves system performance while reducing 83% of the feedback overhead. Besides, the fixed power iterative strategy is suitable for practical system due to low complexity.","","Electronic:978-1-84919-470-9","10.1049/cp.2011.0663","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6192859","Multicast;Resource allocation;SFN","","feedback;iterative methods;multicast communication;quality of service;real-time systems;resource allocation","QoS;SFN;base stations users;channel state information;feedback load;feedback overhead;fixed power iterative scheme;iterative water-filling;multicast resource allocation;power allocation;proportional allocation;quality-of-service;real-time service;single frequency networks;subcarrier allocation;user connection control","","0","","","","","","14-16 Oct. 2011","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

This will lead to significantly high improvement in both the system performance and cell edge performance. An attractive feature of the proposed approach is that the proposed scheme can adapt to different interference scenarios, which will make power allocation more efficient.","","Electronic:978-1-61284-307-0; POD:978-1-61284-306-3","10.1109/ICCT.2011.6157831","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6157831","","Base stations;Downlink;Interference;OFDM;Resource management;Signal to noise ratio;Throughput","OFDM modulation;cellular radio;frequency division multiple access;radiofrequency interference","base stations;cell edge performance;coordinated power allocation algorithm;intercell interference;mobile station analyses;multicell OFDMA systems","","1","","9","","","","25-28 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While browsing the web, the user has to go through many pages of the Internet, filter data and download required information. This task of searching and downloading is time consuming. Sometimes the search queries call for specific option, say, limiting search to few links. To reduce the time spent by users, a web link extraction tool has been designed and implemented in Java, that analyzes the ways of extracting web link information using a standard interface. The Test Scenario has been presented with various keywords like Higher Education, Conference Alerts and Special Interest Group. The present work can be a useful input to Web Users, Faculty, Students and Web Administrators in a University Environment. The web extraction tool helps to save time in searching and downloading files from the web. Another strong requirement is to verify whether the search keywords which have been entered by the user, gives an user accurate and relevant results. This is made possible by performing a quick check on search links. The user can also view the internal links present in the selected HTML files and the adjacency list of the crawled files.","","Electronic:978-1-908320-00-1; POD:978-1-4577-0884-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6148414","Adjacency List;Breadth First Search;Downloading;Web Extraction;Web Structure Mining","Data mining;Google;HTML;Java;User interfaces;Web pages;XML","Internet;data mining;tree searching","Internet;Java;Web extraction tool;Web link extraction tool;Web link information;Web structure mining;academic search application;breadth first search;search queries;standard interface","","0","","18","","","","11-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is particularly important when addressing the current Reality TV Generation that demands immediate relevance. In stark contrast to the silo approach, Informatics brings together technology, information, and people. Scientific principles of analysis, hypothesis, and evaluation are at the heart of informatics, but they are not sterile notions. Informatics makes these principles relevant by working with specific domain information. In the case of high school teenagers, examples of relevant domains include movies, music, and college selection. This paper describes a high school course in informatics that is currently under development. In addition to the natural interdisciplinary nature of informatics, our 3-way partnership and 3-strategy approach to adoption makes this project special. The goal of the project is that by working together and utilizing these diffusion strategies, this team can not only develop and deliver a successful course, but also lay the groundwork for widespread adoption. We believe that successful completion of such a course would empower both college-bound and career-oriented students by helping them work comfortably and effectively with digital information in the 21st century.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-61284-469-5; POD:978-1-61284-468-8; USB:978-1-61284-467-1","10.1109/FIE.2011.6142818","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6142818","STEM;curriculum;high school;informatics;teenformatics","Computer science;Conferences;Diffusion processes;Educational institutions;Informatics;Materials","educational courses;information science education","3-strategy approach;3-way partnership;STEM collaboration cubed;career-oriented students;college selection;college-bound students;diffusion strategies;high school course;high school teenagers;informatics;movies;music;reality TV generation;scientific principles;silo mode;specific domain information","","0","","9","","","","12-15 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The portfolio selection hence depends on the reliability of these inputs and often lead to wrong results due to inaccurate estimation of covariance matrix and expected return.

After the extraction of the ROI, a two-step registration from atlas images to target image is applied to obtain initial segmentations which are combined to generate the final segmentation by several atlas fusion strategies. In the experiments, four different strategies including single maximum, majority voting (MV) and simultaneous truth performance level estimation (STAPLE) and consensus level, labeler accuracy and truth estimation (COLLATE) are tested.

The main contribution of this study is the proposal of a parameter-independent local state and static output feedback Pareto strategy. Moreover, a computational approach for solving the CNMEs is also considered if the information about the small parameter is available. Particularly, a new iterative algorithm based on the linear matrix inequality is established to design a Pareto strategy. Finally, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method, a numerical example is provided for practical aircraft control problems.","1751-8644;17518644","","10.1049/iet-cta.2010.0469","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6044597","","","Pareto analysis;control system synthesis;discrete time systems;iterative methods;linear matrix inequalities;state feedback;stochastic systems","LMI;asymptotic structure;control-dependent noise;cross-coupled nonlinear matrix equations;design method;implicit function theorem;iterative algorithm;linear matrix inequality;local feedback Pareto strategy;parameter-independent local state output feedback;parameter-independent static output feedback;practical aircraft control problems;state-dependent noise;weakly coupled large-scale discrete-time stochastic systems","","1","","","","","","Nov. 17 2011","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

The historic roots of democracy, particularly the legacies of the Greek polis and the French and American revolutions, to some degree have conditioned our thinking and constrained our appreciation of democracy. There is a need for a critical review of these legacies today and this is one of the debates among political scientists and philosophers (Sartori, 1993; Zolo, 2007; Hardt y Negri, 2.000; Dahl, 1989; Huntington, 1989; Mouffe, 2009; Mulgan, 2007). We reflect upon the implications of seeing a country as a viable system that needs effective strategies to manage complexity in turbulent internal and external environments that constantly challenges its stability. We argue for an inclusive strategy that gives to all people the chance to influence their destinies. At a general level key questions we deal with are: what does governance mean? How is it possible for countries large and small to be inclusive? How is it possible to develop effective local-global relationships? How is it possible to reduce power imbalances that inhibit and restrict the effective participation of its citizens? And, in a world experiencing the most extraordinary technological developments, what are possible roles of information and communication technologies to advance towards more effective forms of governance and democracy? We will deal with these questions with reference to Colombia from 1958 to these days.","2166-9430;21669430","Electronic:978-1-61284-491-6; POD:978-1-61284-490-9","10.1109/GSIS.2011.6044090","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6044090","","Assembly","computational complexity;government;politics","Colombia;complexity idea;governance;inclusive democracy;information and communication technology","","0","","20","","","","15-18 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We first derive the sliding mode controller via active control strategy. Then, a simple radial basis function (RBF) NN is designed to approximate the uncertain nonlinear part of the error dynamical system which has been assumed to be available in the active control. The weights of the NN are tuned on-line based on the sliding mode reaching law. According to the Lyapunov stability theory, the stability of the closed-loop error system is guaranteed. Synchronization is obtained by proper choice of the control parameters.

They have diverse cultures, traditions and ways of living, beliefs and language. The Malaysian government is providing assistance in developing Orang Asli education by preparing certain educational assistance for the Orang Asli to remain in schools. In general, there has been significant improvements in the overall school attendance of the Orang Asli. Research done in 2007 by UNICEF shows dropout has decreased over the past 15 years; however 80 percent from of the Orang Asli children still do not complete their secondary school. This problem may be due to the teaching strategy in classroom which may not fit the students' cultures, traditions, ways of living, beliefs and language. This also may apply to the ICTL subject. In Malaysia, the importance of ICT in the education system has been realized as one way to achieve the 2001-2010 education Development Plan. Since the Orang Asli have their own paradigm of education, there should be special teaching methodologies to attract the students' interest, attention and focus in the ICTL subject. In order to achieve this, the teacher should build the ICT program by selecting content and adapting the curricula to address students' learning needs, interest and prior knowledge. They should guides and facilitate learning with a suitable methodology in the classroom. To carry out this study, the ADDIE model is used as a methodology. The aim of this study is to investigate and identify suitable teaching strategy for Orang Asli towards learning ICTL subjects.

It consists in supplying teachers with indicators which report critical situations or interesting moments about learners' activities. Relying on these indicators teachers can intervene and expect the learner targeted by the intervention reacts through certain actions. However, most of the time, teachers have no information about the effects of their interventions. To overcome this lack, we want to provide them with meta-indicators which follow the evolution of indicator values which allowed to detect the situation at the root of their interventions. Thus, teachers can measure the effectiveness of their interventions in order to quickly react by choosing new remediation strategies, in case of failure.","2161-3761;21613761","Electronic:978-0-7695-4346-8; POD:978-1-61284-209-7","10.1109/ICALT.2011.41","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5992280","Indicators;Meta-indicators;Regulation;Synchronous monitoring;Teachers' self-regulation;Tutoring","Conferences;Context;Instruments;Monitoring;Programming profession;Visualization","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational administrative data processing;object-oriented programming","HOP3X;indicator-based approach;meta-indicator;object-oriented programming;use case","","2","","6","","","","6-8 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"The Interaction Analysis of Web Collaborative Exploration Learning in Two Scenarios: Shared-Computer and One-to-One Computer","C. J. Chang; C. C. Liu; K. P. Liu","Grad.

Shared-computer is increasingly used to support web collaborative explorative activities because learners can be facilitated to promote shared understanding of the workspace and enhance effective communications. However, implementing shared-computer can also be inefficient and frustrating because learners have to spend extra time and cognitive resources to negotiate with the web search. This may discourage learners to positively participate the activity. Hence, the study proposes a the 1:1 group (shared-computer integrated one person for one computer) so that learners can individually search web information with their personal laptop according to their strategies and preferences, and then use shared-computer to share their information and interact with peers. An empirical study involved nine graduate students is conducted to examine the learner's interaction behaviors in two scenarios: 1:1 and shared-computer. The result shows that the 1:1 group can better benefit participants' in-depth interaction due to the autonomy of personal web search strategy and preference.","2161-3761;21613761","Electronic:978-0-7695-4346-8; POD:978-1-61284-209-7","10.1109/ICALT.2011.159","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5992387","one-to-one;pattern of interaction;shared-computer;web collaborative exploration learning","Collaborative software;Collaborative work;Portable computers;Presses;Web search","Internet;computer aided instruction;groupware;information retrieval","Web collaborative exploration learning;Web information search;cognitive resources;graduate students;interaction analysis;one-to-one computer learning;personal Web search;personal laptop;shared computer learning","","0","","26","","","","6-8 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

China","2011 IEEE Congress of Evolutionary Computation (CEC)","20110714","2011","","","2563","2570","Power electronic circuit (PEC) always consists of a number of components such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors which have to be optimized in order to obtain good circuit performance. In current studies, the search ranges of these components are always pre-defined carefully by expert designers, making it difficult for practical applications. In this paper, the search space is freely set to the commonly used ranges and an efficient orthogonal learning particle swarm optimization (OLPSO) is applied to optimally design the PEC with such search space. OLPSO uses an orthogonal learning (OL) strategy for PSO to discover useful information that lies in the personal historical best experience and the neighborhood's best experience via orthogonal experimental design. Therefore, OLPSO can construct a more promising and efficient exemplar to guide particle to fly better towards the global optimal region. OLPSO is implemented to optimize the design of a buck regulator in PEC.

"Multiobjective Optimization of HEV Fuel Economy and Emissions Using the Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution Algorithm","L. Wu; Y. Wang; X. Yuan; Z.

Based on an electric assist control strategy, the HEV optimal design problem is formulated as a nonlinear constrained multiobjective problem with competing and noncommensurable objectives of fuel consumption and emissions. The driving performance requirements are considered constraints. The proposed MOSADE approach adopts an external elitist archive to retain nondominated solutions that are found during the evolutionary process. To preserve the diversity of Pareto optimal solutions, a progressive comparison truncation operator based on the normalized nearest neighbor distance is proposed. Moreover, a fuzzy set theory is employed to extract the best compromise solution. Finally, the optimization is performed over the following three typical driving cycles that are currently used in the U.S. and European communities: 1) the file transfer protocol; 2) ECE+EUDC; and 3) Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule. The results demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to generate well-distributed Pareto optimal solutions of the HEV multiobjective optimization design problem. The comparison with the reported results of genetic-algorithm-based weighting sum approaches and Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II reveals the superiority of the proposed approach and confirms its potential for optimal HEV design.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2011.2157186","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5771613","Differential evolution (DE) algorithm;emissions;fuel consumption (FC);hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs);multiobjective optimization","Batteries;Engines;Fuels;Hybrid electric vehicles;Optimization;Torque","Pareto optimisation;air pollution control;fuel economy;genetic algorithms;hybrid electric vehicles","ECE+EUDC;HEV fuel economy;Pareto optimal solutions;component sizing;control strategy;electric assist control strategy;evolutionary process;file transfer protocol;fuel consumption;fuel emissions;fuzzy set theory;genetic-algorithm-based weighting sum approaches;multiobjective self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm;nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II;nonlinear constrained multiobjective problem;normalized nearest neighbor distance;parallel hybrid electric vehicles;progressive comparison truncation operator;urban dynamometer driving schedule","","39","1","30","","","20110519","July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Traffic grooming strategy in dynamic optical networks can optimise the utilisation of bandwidth resources and reduce the blocking probability. However, in the distributed control plane of automated switched optical networks, all the traffic grooming strategies are implemented in each control node, and resource collision will still occur because the same link resource may be used by two path computation requests or traffic engineering information flooded by open shortest path first-traffic engineering protocol may be not synchronous at each control node or signalling delay time is too long. To reduce the collision of resource, a unified control plane is designed based on path computation element (PCE) for Internet protocol over wavelength division multiplexing networks, and a novel PCE-based traffic grooming strategy is proposed in the framework of unified control plane. Based on this strategy, four PCE-based traffic grooming algorithms are proposed and compared with the distributed traffic grooming strategy without PCE on a simulation platform implemented using disperse event simulation tool OMNET++.","1751-8628;17518628","","10.1049/iet-com.2010.0618","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5893893","","","IP networks;bandwidth allocation;broadband networks;optical fibre networks;probability;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;wavelength division multiplexing","Internet protocol;PCE-based traffic grooming algorithm;automated switched optical network;bandwidth fragment;bandwidth resource utilisation;blocking probability;broadband service;disperse event simulation tool OMNET++;distributed control plane;distributed traffic grooming strategy;dynamic optical network;link resource;open shortest path first-traffic engineering protocol;optical channel;path computation element-based traffic grooming;resource collision;traffic engineering information;transmission performance;wavelength division multiplexing network","","1","","","","","","May 2011","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

The adaptive control strategy can estimate the uncertain parameters and adaptively compensate the modeled dynamical uncertainties, while the sliding mode control method overcomes the unmodelled dynamics. In the adaptive law an equivalent output injection of the sliding mode observer which contains the parameter estimation error is used, and estimates of parameters can approximate the true values without prediction-error that is typically used in compositive adaptive law. Due to the improved estimation of uncertain parameters, the sliding mode law can robustifies the design against model uncertainties with a small swithcing gain. Stability of the system with the proposed approach has been proved and it has also been shown that the system states can reach the sliding mode in finite time.

In this paper the optimal energy optimization problem for the sensor node is concerned, and the objective is to obtain the long-term average maximum throughput per energy consumption. First, we analyze the energy conservation optimization problem in the background of cross-layer adaptive transmission over fading channels. For less energy consumption on data sensing, receiving and sending we refer to a mechanism which dynamically turns on or off different components, adjusts transmit power and modulation level of the sensor node while maintaining required performance. Then, the problem is modified by introducing dynamic power management (DPM) technique and modeled as an average reward Markov decision process (AR-MDP). Combined with simulated annealing (SA), Q learning algorithm is proposed to solve the energy conservation optimization problem with average performance criteria. Finally, the simulation results show that the approach in this paper is more efficient than always on policy or random policy. As the approach the energy consumption can be well balanced while the throughput of the sensor node doesn't decrease significantly.","","Electronic:978-89-956056-4-6; POD:978-1-61284-487-9","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5899198","AR-MDP;Cross-Layer Optimization;DPM;Q-learning;Sensor Node","Energy conservation;Energy consumption;Modulation;Optimization;Sensors;Throughput;Wireless sensor networks","Markov processes;energy conservation;fading channels;simulated annealing;wireless sensor networks","Q-learning;average reward Markov decision process;cross-layer adaptive transmission;dynamic power management technique;energy conservation optimization strategy;fading channels;optimal energy optimization problem;simulated annealing;wireless sensor network node","","0","","14","","","","15-18 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, a professional sportsman or coach wonders about high level semantics in a different perspective, such as the offensive or defensive strategy performed by the players. Analyzing tactics is much more challenging in a broadcast basketball video than in other kinds of sports videos due to its complicated scenes and varied camera movements. In this paper, by developing a quadrangle candidate generation algorithm and refining the model fitting score, we ameliorate the court-based camera calibration technique to be applicable to broadcast basketball videos. Player trajectories are extracted from the video by a CamShift-based tracking method and mapped to the real-world court coordinates according to the calibrated results. The player position/trajectory information in the court coordinates can be further analyzed for professional-oriented applications such as detecting wide open event, retrieving target video clips based on trajectories, and inferring implicit/explicit tactics. Experimental results show the robustness of the proposed calibration and tracking algorithms, and three practicable applications are introduced to address the applicability of our system.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2010.2100373","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5671490","Broadcast basketball video;CamShift algorithm;camera calibration;highlight extraction;player tracking","","calibration;feature extraction;object tracking;sport;video cameras;video retrieval;video signal processing","CamShift based tracking method;basketball video;broadcast sport video;player tracking;robust camera calibration;video browsing tool","","24","","30","","","20101217","April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Additionally, a fuzzy constraint-based negotiation mechanism is employed to coordinate the cognitive differences between students. Through iterative agent negotiation, students can reconcile the differences and reach an agreement on the assessment results. Thus, the proposed framework allows students to provide more detailed, informed, and less biased assessments for their peers' work. To demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed approach, a negotiation-based peer assessment system, NePAS, has been built and used in classroom. Experimental results suggested that students were more willing to accept the assessment results and able to acquire more useful information to reflect upon and revise their work. Instructors can also observe students' participation and performance to appropriately adjust instructional strategies.","1939-1382;19391382","","10.1109/TLT.2010.30","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5560631","Peer assessment;agent negotiation;assessment bias;fuzzy constraints.","Book reviews;Cognition;Computational modeling;Materials;Proposals;Reflection;Uncertainty","educational administrative data processing;fuzzy set theory;negotiation support systems;social sciences computing","NePAS;agent negotiation;fuzzy constraint-based negotiation mechanism;fuzzy constraints;negotiation-based peer assessment system;peer assessment enrichment","","14","","37","","","20100902","Jan.-March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Different Paths to Broadband Access: The Impact of Governance and Policy on Broadband Diffusion in the Developed and Developing Worlds","D. J. Yates; G. J. Gulati; J. W. Weiss","Bentley Univ. Waltham, Waltham, MA, USA","2011 44th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","20110222","2011","","","1","10","A new digital divide is emerging both within and between nations that is due to inequalities in broadband Internet access. Our research examines the broadband digital divide by analyzing the impact of administrative culture and policy initiatives in the form of strategic planning, execution, regulation and investment on broadband diffusion in 139 countries. Our multiple regression analysis shows that factors that determine broadband diffusion in technologically developed countries do not necessarily have the same impact in less developed countries. For example, competition in the telecommunications sector has a positive impact in nations where access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) is expanding, but does not make a significant difference where ICT access is widely available. We also show that when controlling for measures of economic, political, social and educational development, there is greater broadband diffusion in countries that have an administrative culture of sound governance and make a higher shared financial investment in information and communication technologies. These results hold in nations where access to ICTs is expanding, even though the presence of a national telecommunications regulatory authority has a negative impact on broadband diffusion in the same group of countries. Our results suggest that the path to widespread availability and use of broadband requires different strategies depending on a nation's level of technological development. Furthermore, assessing overall government performance in terms of governance and policy initiatives on this journey is more important than factors such as the presence or absence of a national regulatory authority.","1530-1605;15301605","Electronic:978-0-7695-4282-9; POD:978-1-4244-9618-1","10.1109/HICSS.2011.165","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5718598","","Broadband communication;Education;Government;Indexes;Internet;Investments;Telecommunications","Digital Divide;Internet;broadband networks;government policies;investment;strategic planning","broadband access;broadband diffusion;digital divide;economic development;educational development;financial investment;governance;information and communication technologies;policy;political development;social development;strategic planning","","6","","43","","","","4-7 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the propagation measurement data in urban environment, we deal with the capacity evaluation for a two-hop amplify-and-forward MIMO relay channel in this paper. Since achieving the theoretic capacity requires the channel state information of both hops at the relay node, a limited feedback scheme is introduced. Distinguished from the conventional schemes, both precoding matrix and channel eigenvalues are quantized and fed back, and a novel codebook design method for the eigenvalues is proposed. Adopting the presented scheme, the values of ergodic capacity for various antenna configurations, precoding codebooks, feedback quantities and power allocation strategies are finally evaluated by real channel responses. The numerical results indicate that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing ones and the channel eigenvalues are essential for feedback.","","Electronic:978-0-9845893-3-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5684805","","Complexity theory;MIMO","MIMO communication;amplify and forward communication;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","MIMO relay channels;amplify-and-forward;capacity evaluation;channel eigenvalues;limited feedback;system capacity;urban environment","","0","","15","","","","25-27 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both the overproduction and underproduction of the manufacturer are cut down to a lower level than before. This paper proposes to extend their supply chain into two-echelon that considering the customer's demands. A simulation model written in Matlab 7.0 is developed to investigate how the forecasting error between the retailers' predictions and the customers' actual demands impacts the AR strategy. Two major stages are included in the simulation procedure. Stage 1 studies the performance of AR strategy using the developed simulation model. Stage 2 investigates how the forecasting error between the retailers' estimations and the customers' actual demands influences the performance of AR strategy. 8 levels of forecasting error are input into the simulation model to calculate the overestimation and underestimation of the retailers, the overproduction and underproduction of the manufacturer. For each level of error, ten experiments are conducted based on different error distributions stochastically generated. The result of the simulation shows that with forecasting error of retailers, the mean overproduction and underproduction of manufacturer increases significantly. This result shows the limitation of the AR strategy in apparel supply chain. It also indicates the importance of information sharing and in-season replenishments to the performance of the apparel supply chain.","","Electronic:978-962-367-696-0; POD:978-1-4244-7981-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5681784","Apparel;Forecasting error;Simulation model;Supply chain management","Color;Estimation;Forecasting;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Supply chains","clothing industry;customer satisfaction;forecasting theory;statistical distributions;supply chain management","Matlab simulation model;Obermeyer case;accurate response strategy;customer demands;error distribution;forecasting error;manufacturer overproduction;manufacturer underproduction;two-echelon apparel supply chain","","0","","16","","","","6-9 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Group-failure based cross-layer survivability is eager to be solved in intelligent optical networks, and the corresponding key theory and technology are anxious to be proposed. This paper mainly focuses on the performance of cross-layer survivability based on group-failure in intelligent optical networks.

"Research on optimal bidding strategies for power suppliers based on sealed auction","Wenxia You; Dandan Xu; Wenwu Li","College of Electrical Engineering & Renewable Energy, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, Hubei, China","2010 International Conference on Power System Technology","20101213","2010","","","1","5","In the background of deregulated electricity marketplaces, the electricity price is not determined by a power authority but by competitive bidding behaviors of power suppliers. Competitive bidding makes power supplies being no longer just the electricity price takers. Each power supplier becomes involved in setting the electricity price. He could maximize his own profits according to information of his private cost and the market. But at the same time, power suppliers have to face some uncertain market information. It is significant to build power suppliers' bidding strategies models which can provide support for suppliers' bidding decision. Fortunately, sealed auction is a static game of incomplete information in essence and it can be more conformed to the features of bidding in electricity market, so auction models have been proposed for representing strategic behaviors of power suppliers. The related literatures for the most part have considered the costs as independent random variables drawn from some specific distribution and the price as an expected forecast value. However, given the demand, the price in fact is determined by the ordered bids of suppliers according to the market clearing rules. So the clearing price is a function of the power supplier's own bid and the competitive opponents' bids distributions. Based on the hypothesis that all suppliers have the same generation capacity and have no withholding strategies, the number of winners is fixed when the power demand is given. Hence, the market clearing price is an order statistic. In this paper, the sealed auction theory is applied to analysis the power supplier's bidding actions. Firstly, the probabilities of a supplier winning or loosing the bid are obtained in virtue of the order statistic method. The power supplier's bidding model is constructed. The general expressions of optimal bidding strategies of suppliers are derived next by using optimization theory and solving a differential equation- - . The results suggest that the equilibrium bid is increasing in cost and is always above or equal to the cost. The bid-cost margin is influenced by the total quantity of demand and the costs distributions. Then, a numerical example is presented to confirm the presented method. At last, the power demand's effects on the suppliers' bidding strategies are discussed.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5940-7; POD:978-1-4244-5938-4","10.1109/POWERCON.2010.5666545","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5666545","bidding strategies;market clearing price;order statistic;power suppliers;private information;sealed auction","Analytical models;Education","consumer behaviour;differential equations;game theory;optimisation;power markets;probability;statistical analysis","deregulated electricity market;differential equation;electricity price;optimal bidding strategy;optimization;power suppliers;probability;sealed auction;static game;statistic method;strategic behaviors","","0","","14","","","","24-28 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Information efficiency means that prices fully reflect all relevant information at every instant and therefore prices can not be predicted, i.e. prices are evolving randomly. When stock markets are not efficient, there are possibilities for speculation. Although neither the direction nor the magnitude of the price change can be specified without knowing the expectations model of investors, therefore Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) will be used for removing the market wide effects, i.e. unspecified factors. By removing the effects from unspecified factors, unexpected price changes can be estimated, in period around the announcement day, due to the incoming information. The aim of this paper is to provide evidence of information which can affect investor's strategies, and to compare the influence of bad news and good news to the price changes. Moreover, empirical analysis will show that there is significant correlation between information content of the incoming news and price volatility (unexpected price changes) based on data set of daily closing prices for 6 most traded stocks, all obtained form Zagreb Stock Exchange.

Student role changed to be knowledge and information hunter rather than receiver, and teaching, meanwhile, is becoming a peripheral activity. Several interactive and new methods of learning has evolved in the last two decades aimed to utilizing the information and communication technology tools to improve the educational process availability and accessibility. The learning management system (LMS) is the system responsible for integrating all learning services and managing teaching and learning activities. It provides a collection of tools and functions to support teaching and learning processes, usually including course management tools, online group discussion, homework collections and grading, and course evaluation. This study was conducted to evaluate different open source learning management systems that were under consideration to be implemented by the College of Medicine, King Saud University (CMKSU), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The study reviewed open source and commercial LMS systems as a future strategy. Objectives: the main objective of the current study was to assess the open source LMS systems based on conducting literature review and practical evaluation. The study included a literature review on LMS including commercial and open source systems. The study focused on evaluating three open source LMS systems, Jusur, Sakai, and Moodle. Jusur is the LMS adopted by the National E-learning center in Saudi Arabia, and the other two LMS systems are considered as the principal open source LMS systems implemented worldwide. Methodology: this study depended on published technical reports, LMS systems official websites, and industry reviews, as well as examining the products features and evaluating how they meet CMKSU needs and requirements. Results: All the three LMS systems provide excellent tools including discussion boards, chat sessions- - , and other collaboration tools. Jusur has a strong localization features and technical support and training. On the other hand Sakai and Moodel were ranked better for the user interface and other content and course management features. Sakai is having the advantage of being developed in Java platform. Moodle and Sakai support integration with other systems, while Jusur support the integration in the offline mode only. Conclusion: Open source LMS systems is more recommended because of its popularity among reputable universities, and the benefits of such systems including exchange of experience and e-courses if the development efforts are guaranteed, as well as the availability of the skills required for the development. In the current study, the evaluation focused on the features of LMS systems and a combination of several frameworks to enhance the evaluation process. All three LMS systems provide excellent tools for student interactions and activities. Standards and integration that make these systems able to communicate with other students and hospitals systems are critical features. In addition, the LMS system should be able as well to mange and accommodate a huge amount of information that needed among medical and educational content, including different subjects, lecture notes, lecture videos, text books, videos of surgeries, and radiology images.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8618-2; POD:978-1-4244-8616-8","10.1109/ICEMT.2010.5657569","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5657569","","Biomedical imaging;Educational institutions;Electronic learning;Information systems;Information technology;Least squares approximation","Java;Web sites;biomedical education;courseware;educational courses;educational institutions;information technology;interactive systems;medical computing;public domain software;teaching","Java platform;Moodle;Sakai;Saudi Arabia;Web site;course management tool;educational process;homework collection;information and communication technology;interactive learning method;learning service;online group discussion;open source learning management system;teaching;university medical education","","6","","32","","","","2-4 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the violation faced by the internet users is cyber stalking. Cyber stalking is an evolvement of a real world stalking; it is harassment and stalking through telecommunication technology. This study employs the qualitative approach in exploring the phenomenon of cyber stalking in Malaysia. A total of 10 cyber stalking victims were interviewed for their experiences. The findings discovered that the factors contributing to cyber stalking include love obsession, love affairs, flirting, and revenge. Four types of cyber stalking are discovered from the study are harassing, threatening, intimidating and impersonating profiles. Cyber stalking victims experienced psychological and behavioral effects such as depression, isolation, anxiety and extreme cautious of their surroundings. In facing the phenomenon they developed strategies such as confiding with family members, close and trusted friends for support. A positive effect of being cyber stalked is the tendency to be more alert during online, and careful in sharing their personal information through the social networking sites.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8618-2; POD:978-1-4244-8616-8","10.1109/ICEMT.2010.5657665","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5657665","Cyber Stalking;Internet Users;Malaysia;Social Informatics;Social networking Technology;Web 2.0","Computer crime;Electronic mail;Facebook;Internet;Psychology","Internet;social aspects of automation;social networking (online)","Internet users;Internet violations;behavioral effects;collaborative platform;cyber stalking;interactive platform;psychological effects;social networking sites;social networking technology;telecommunication technology","","2","","13","","","","2-4 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly, we formulate a channel access game model, which considers multiple nodes concurrent transmissions in a single-channel for wireless ad hoc networks. We identify the utility function balanced throughput and cost, and then calculate a Nash equilibrium solution (NES) as the transmission threshold. It allows each node to determine whether or not it is feasible to transmit concurrently depending on channel conditions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a Bayesian Nash Equilibrium Solution of the game, and compute it using numerical methods. Simulation results show the proposed approach is feasible. On the basis, we propose multiple concurrent transmissions framework by game theory for wireless ad hoc networks. The framework enables multiple transmissions to proceed concurrently in a single-channel, which improves network throughput and bandwidth efficiency.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6837-9; POD:978-1-4244-6834-8","10.1109/ICISS.2010.5657040","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5657040","Nash equilibrium solution;ad hoc networks;concurrent transmission;game theory","Receivers","Bayes methods;ad hoc networks;data communication;game theory;wireless channels","Bayesian Nash equilibrium solution;Bayesian interference game;channel access game model;concurrent transmissions;game theory;wireless ad hoc networks","","0","","10","","","","22-24 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

College computers compulsory education, which aims to train and develop students from non-computer science disciplines computer application skills, is one of the most important parts of higher education in china. Although a lot of advanced technologies and learning platforms over the past years have been introduction in this field, most of them however just focused on interactive, personalized instruction effectiveness and little attention has been given to examine how collective learning can be offered, coordinated and assessed. As one of the most popular web2.0 technologies, wiki is believed to have large potential for fostering collaborative group work and creating learning resources. In this study, a Wiki-based collaborative learning environment for one college compulsory course entitled “Visual Basic Programming Design” was presented.

To reduce the perceptual alias of features easily confused, we propose an approach which combines a modified feature descriptor with a novel matching strategy. The feature descriptor is modified by augmenting traditional SIFT vector with dominant hue histogram. A novel matching strategy is developed to validate true matches by establishing geometrical relationships between candidate matching features.

As a case in point, Applied Oceanography (AO), a highly multidisciplinary and an intermediate course at Community College of Rhode Island between 1976- '81 is assessed as a skill-oriented tool for 250 students; mostly middle-age and working. AO's contents included these contemporary and fairly technical topics: offshore petroleum, energy technologies, ocean mining, fisheries, sea-farming, conservation and management of marine resources, and pollution. The student population varied in terms of their economic status, age, and educational preparation. In terms of profession, studentbody comprised doctors, nurses, engineers, technicians, environmentalists, fishermen, retired navymen, businessmen including one company president to name a few. As a teaching strategy, AO emphasized development of these skills: reading, writing, and speech using the vast reservoir of basic and contemporary knowledge of the ocean business. The aforementioned skills were indirectly incorporated in the preparation, and subsequent oral presentation of each student's assigned research project before the class. Also, necessary incentives were offered to students for group communication throughout the course duration. AO had adopted a lecture/seminar style format. The student evaluation of AO indicated rating of 8 on a 1 to 10 scale. More important, in terms of productivity, at present seven volumes of selected research projects is underway for an intended publication in the near furture. It is concluded that a skill-oriented approach is more effective as a learning process than a conventional lecture format; especially in the c- - omplex domain of ocean business.","","","10.1109/OCEANS.1982.1151799","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1151799","","Aquaculture;Content management;Education;Educational institutions;Energy management;Marine technology;Oceans;Petroleum;Resource management;Technology management","","","","1","","8","","","","20-22 Sept. 1982","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the rapid growth of Internet technologies and easy access to information, the field of digital learning has stimulated innovation and diversified developments, and the emergence of guidance systems provide learners with adaptive learning paths that promote learning performance during learning processes. However, most guidance systems neglect to consider the level of difficulty, and recommended materials are proprietary in nature, and thus, do not fully utilize portfolio features of learners incorporated into personalized learning services when implementing personalized guidance. Therefore, this study proposed a guidance mechanism which utilizes the data of a learning portfolio to evaluate guidance parameters, and simultaneously considers information regarding the degree of relational reading, reading difficulty, and the average ability of learners, which can be entered into a genetic algorithm to construct a near optimal reading sequence during learning activities. Experiments were conducted to compare the free browsing reading mode without the guidance of a personalized reading path, as in most present systems. Based on the experimental results, this proposed guidance mechanism generates a high quality and concise learning path for individual learners, and the reading learning system results in an efficient and effective learning performance to promote learning motivation through appropriate learning paths.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7570-4; POD:978-1-4244-7567-4","10.1109/HUMANCOM.2010.5563359","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5563359","","Adaptive systems;Biological cells;Education;Learning systems;Materials;Portfolios;Vocabulary","Internet;computer aided instruction;information retrieval;natural languages","English language;English learning;English speaking countries;Internet;digital learning;guidance system;learning portfolio analysis;optimal reading sequence;personalized English reading;sequencing strategy","","0","","23","","","","11-13 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Finally, under the circumstance of the underwater acoustic environment and by use of the simulation tool-OPNET, we separately simulate our proposed MACA and the original MACA introduced or modified in the former research. The simulation results show that compared to the original MACA, our proposed MACA could not only steadily maintains the performance in throughput but also dramatically reduces the packet loss rate. Moreover, our improved MACA distinctly decreases the average end-to-end time delay of data packets as well as remarkably lowers the average energy consumption for transmitting data packets.

The idea is based on the late acceptance strategy in hill climbing (LAHC). Both LAHC and ALARD use a list to store penalty values of some recently accepted solutions. However, ALARD differs from the basic LAHC as it uses an average quality of accepted solutions in the list as the acceptance criterion, whilst LAHC used the selected solution quality in the acceptance list as the acceptance criterion. Therefore, the performance of ALARD does not rely on the length of list (because the acceptance criterion is based on the threshold value), whilst LAHC is very much depending on the length of the list. Results tested on the Socha's benchmark datasets showed that, ALARD produces significantly good quality solutions compared to LAHC and comparable to other approaches tested on this dataset.","2155-8973;21558973","Electronic:978-1-4244-6718-1; POD:978-1-4244-6715-0","10.1109/ITSIM.2010.5561545","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5561545","Course Timetabling Problem;Late Acceptance Strategy in Hill Climbing","Equations;Robustness","education;search problems","LAHC;acceptance criterion;average late acceptance randomized descent algorithm;late acceptance strategy in hill climbing;university course timetabling problem","","2","","29","","","","15-17 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This factor may indicate that new strategies and methodologies must be addressed and implemented in the classroom context, which must be adjusted to a new learning. The use of casting technologies has been found to be increasingly used associated with their apparent potential impact. Changes and innovations regarding the content of various subjects as well as respective activities are on the horizon. This need for change stems from the new technological environments/contexts within which the students are included.

A field survey has been conducted with 150 learners who had experiences in web-based learning. The proposed hypotheses were examined by structural equation modeling. According to the analysis results, we have found that: 1) the knowledge sharing attitude is mainly influenced by subjective norms, expected contribution, and expected loss; 2) the knowledge sharing attitude is secondarily influenced by disincentives and altruism; 3) the subjective norm is mainly influenced by instructors' expectation; 4) the perceived behavioral control is mainly influenced by the abilities of learners in using information technologies; 5) the knowledge sharing intention is mainly influenced by knowledge sharing attitude and subjective norms.

The definition of user, role, task and privilege, constraint rule, authorization strategy and their relationship are described formally. The privilege is defined as a series of operations on object in the access control model. The constraints of user and role are defined by the constraints of task.

Their results are decisive to the accuracy of next processing, such as information searching, information filtration. As separate problems of English, MA, POS, PDR can be considered independent with each other. In a practical research system, however, they are dependent: solution of the prior one forms the base for processing the next one. Considering different features of these problems in this thesis, after a comprehensive study, a divide-and-conqueror strategy is proposed and resolves them separately. First, a knowledge-based method is put forward for the solution of MA. The whole MA processing is completed by many subordinate functions dealing with different particular marks of English words.

Through the connotation, nature, the strategies of autonomous learning implementation, together with the analysis of the management of autonomous learning mode, we are hoping to enable learners to grasp technical movements rapidly so as to improve the quality and the efficiency of the university of physical education. Autonomous learning is one of the essential targets for educating students in the field of modern education. Physical education is a bilateral activity with high practicality, the traditional methodology teaches students knowledge and technique through explanation and demonstration. For this reason, it is necessary to change the original unilateral passive way of learning and establish and form diversified learning mode aiming at fully mobilizing and exerting students' dominant role, as well as promote student' active and personalized learning and under the guidance of teachers. Therefore, the study and guidance as well as training towards autonomous learning should be an important part of university physical education. The ideal teaching of university physical education can enhance students' initiative and collaboration; and gradually bring about the transfor- ation of the teaching way of presenting the content, mode of learning and teacher-student interaction. Also it can make full use of information technological advantages to provide enriched educational resources and good venues for the students, as well as good guidance for students' life-long physical exercise.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5517-1; POD:978-1-4244-5514-0","10.1109/EDT.2010.5496393","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5496393","Initiative Learning Mode;The Teaching of University Physical Education","Application software;Computer applications;Computer networks;Computer science education;Ecosystems;Educational technology;Multimedia communication;Physics computing;Quality management;Space technology","computer aided instruction;educational courses","autonomous learning;computer aided physical education;information technological advantages;personalized learning;students initiative collaboration enhancement;students life long physical exercise;teacher student interaction;unilateral passive way of learning;university physical education teaching","","0","","5","","","","17-18 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model integrates four main instructional strategies at the program level: mentoring; participation in an online community of professional learning and practice; collaborative concept-mapping with an object-typed knowledge modeling software, and face-to-face seminars in a work setting. Based on interview and observation data collected during two successive small-scale experimentations of the model, we explored potential factors that could have had an impact on students' academic retention and achievement. Four types of factors were identified: personal, professional, institutional and pedagogical. We found that pedagogical and professional factors, which are insufficiently considered in theoretical models of student retention, are of primary concern for students who work full-time as professionals. A blended learning model designed at the program level and strongly “situated” in the professional practice of the students is a promising avenue to adjust to their career constraints and aspirations and, thus, promoting their academic retention and achievement.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5792-2; POD:978-1-4244-4810-4","10.1109/ITHET.2010.5480102","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5480102","Blended Learning;Curriculum Design;Design-Based Research;Non-Traditional Students;Professional Learning;Student Retention","Application specific processors;Collaborative software;Collaborative work;Computer aided instruction;Education;Educational programs;Employee welfare;Engineering profession;Online Communities/Technical Collaboration;Seminars","educational courses;educational institutions;further education;professional aspects","academic retention promotion;blended learning model;collaborative concept mapping;face-to-face seminars;full-time professional workers;higher education professional study programs;in-service teachers;object typed knowledge modeling software;professional learning;school administration;university professional study program","","1","","25","","","","April 29 2010-May 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Academicians are important assets in institutions of higher learning; therefore it is critical to understand tacit knowledge which resides in them. The lack of understanding of tacit knowledge impedes the efforts of managing it as a source of competitive advantage. The research employs the grounded theory approach and data are gathered through semi-structured interviews incorporating the critical incidences technique. It is discovered that tacit knowledge of Malaysian academicians is knowledge internalized in their work practices, which is externalized through action strategies in fulfilling the seven performance indicators introduced by the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education. Three dimensions of tacit knowledge are discovered, namely the intellectual-affirmation tacit knowledge, self tacit knowledge and social tacit knowledge. Theoretical contributions from this study include a paradigm model of knowledge internalization and a theoretical model of tacit knowledge dimensions in Malaysian academia. Practically, the research highlights the tacit knowledge content of successful academicians which is imperative to improve the performance of an academician and the institution.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5652-9; POD:978-1-4244-5650-5","10.1109/INFRKM.2010.5466892","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466892","Grounded Theory;Knowledge Management;Tacit Knowledge;Tacit Knowledge Dimensions","Computer science;Curriculum development;Decision making;Educational institutions;Impedance;Information management;Knowledge management;Management information systems;Product development;Turing machines","educational institutions;further education;knowledge management","Malaysian Ministry of Higher education;Malaysian academia;academicians;action strategies;critical incidences technique;grounded theory;higher learning;institution assets;intellectual-affirmation tacit knowledge;knowledge internalization;performance indicators;self tacit knowledge;semistructured interviews;social tacit knowledge;tacit knowledge dimensions;work practices","","1","","27","","","","17-18 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Motivated by human social learning, we believe that a transparent learning process can help guide the human teacher to provide the most informative instruction. We believe active learning is an inherently transparent machine learning approach because the learner formulates queries to the oracle that reveal information about areas of uncertainty in the underlying model. In this work, we implement active learning on the Simon robot in the form of nonverbal gestures that query a human teacher about a demonstration within the context of a social dialogue. Our preliminary pilot study data show potential for transparency through active learning to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the teaching process. However, our data also seem to indicate possible undesirable effects from the human teacher's perspective regarding balance of the interaction. These preliminary results argue for control strategies that balance leading and following during a social learning interaction.","2167-2121;21672121","Electronic:978-1-4244-4893-7; POD:978-1-4244-4892-0","10.1109/HRI.2010.5453178","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5453178","active learning;human-robot interaction;interactive learning;social robots;socially guided machine learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Chaos;Education;Educational institutions;Educational robots;Hospitals;Human robot interaction;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Uncertainty","human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence)","Simon robot;human social learning;human teachers;nonverbal gestures;pilot study data;social learning interaction;transparent active learning;transparent machine learning approach","","14","","23","","","","2-5 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, an SQL-based database is used to collect clinically-used XML 12-lead ECG files, which are processed to extract ECG waveform data. Second, an interactive ECG browser allowing online ECG waveform measurement is created by using Silverlight technology of vector-based graph visualization. Third, a tree-like XML-based document, which is based on the waveform template of DICOM structure report, is developed to record ECG waveform measurement, treatment strategies, and relative diseases. Results indicate that clinicians can greatly benefit from ECG waveform pattern search. By using this developed system, clinicians can significantly enhance their ability to find out correlations between ECG morphologies and heart diseases.

It also helps bridge the gap between knowledge production and its use whenever academics become involved with open source development contrary to the proprietary model where software is produced within the confines of commercial vendors R&D labs. However in higher education, open source has not broken through the bottom of the software stack where it is confined to fulfilling mostly system computing requirements. At the application and visible level, open source adoption is hampered by a number of factors chief amongst these is the lack of reliable ICT governance structures. The problem is exacerbated in developing country contexts where governance in general is subjected to the power-play between several actors of the higher education scene. The governance conundrum faced by open source adoption in developing countries is illustrated through a detailed case study of an open source project failure at GNU, an American-style university in the Gulf region. The rise and fall of GNU open source project is discussed within a general framework of ICT and open source governance in developing countries higher education sector.

While still considered the gold standard against which alternatives are judged, current educational methods?-? a combination of lectures and laboratory dissections?-? fall short of instilling the requisite 3-D conceptualization, retention, and application of anatomic knowledge to clinical-problem solving. These pedagogical challenges are further complicated by shortened anatomy curricula owing to competition from other courses; the desirability of less dependence on human cadavers because of scarcity, costs, aesthetics, and environmental concerns; and reductions in hours and resources (including faculty) available for wet laboratory coursework. At the same time, many curricula are including greater amounts of anat omic information, including conceptually challenging 3-D relationships, a need that could be well met by VR-based anatomy resources.</P>","","97804712166","10.1002/0471216690.ch8","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=5236555.pdf&bkn=5201685&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","","2001","","","","","Wiley-IEEE Press","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

Egypt is the case study selected for having major problems in healthcare. This research methodology is qualitative with proof of some empirical data, gathered from experiments held online for a group of Egyptian healthcare professionals using two different delivery techniques of content with the same pedagogical strategies. In an attempt to analyze the driven results after delivering this e-course using two different techniques, it was concluded that the WBT method was better as a more learner-centered, motivating, content-focused, allowing collaboration and discussion between peers, at effective timing, however it was harder to implement.

However, according to properties of mobile environments, mobile devices have many considerations, such as mobility management, disconnected operation, device heterogeneity, service discovery, resource sharing, security and so on. To conquest these problems, there are two trends for mobile grid computing: a proxy-based mobile grid architecture and an agent-based mobile grid architecture. We focused on a proxy-based mobile grid architecture with IP-paging, which easily manage idle mobile devices and grid resource status information. In result, to support mobile grid services, we propose the IP-paging scheme based on the mobile grid computing framework.

Pre configured protection cycles (p-cycle) is a kind of preconfigured protection mechanism that can have mesh-like resource efficiency and ring-link protection speed. But under multi-region survivable network, the topology and resource information is not always available due to policy reasons or other else, so distributed approach with agent negotiation is attractable. As the dimensions of WDM optical network grows larger and larger, it tends to be a mesh structure. Based on SURBED, we take extensive simulation to investigate the performance of different signaling strategies by multi-region agent negotiations. Unlike previous work, we focus on the reconfiguring process rather than the switching over operation of control plane in ASON. The backbone is overlaid, in which most of devices are IP router networks. Routers are interconnected by fibers or SDH or WDM links.

In the data confidentiality domain, a secret message is transformed into multiple shares by secret sharing schemes and then forwarding towards destination via multiple neighbours so that even if a small number of relay nodes are compromised, the secret as a whole is not compromised. In the reliable domain, various reliability requirements are supported by probabilistic multipath forwarding in a localized way by employing localized geographic packet forwarding. However, the two domains may conflict. So we propose non-dominated dynamic assignment strategy, which compensates for both local decision inaccuracies and the possible conflict as a packet travels towards its destination. This way, proposed scheme can guarantee end-to-end secure and reliable requirements in a localized way. Simulation results show the correctness and effectiveness of proposed scheme.","1087-4089;10874089","Electronic:978-1-4244-5404-4; POD:978-1-4244-5403-7","10.1109/I-SPAN.2009.86","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381908","Localized Algorithm;Multipath Routing;Reliability;Security;Wireless Sensor Networks","Computer network reliability;Computer science;Computer science education;Cryptography;Educational technology;Information security;Paper technology;Routing protocols;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","multicast protocols;telecommunication network reliability;wireless sensor networks","data confidentiality;local decision inaccuracies;localized geographic packet forwarding;multipath protocol;nondominated dynamic compensation;packet delivery mechanism;probabilistic multipath forwarding;relay nodes;secret sharing schemes;wireless sensor networks reliability","","0","","17","","","","14-16 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

PBL has been used since the 1950' s. Students take responsibility for their own learning as PBL encourages students to identify their learning needs and determine the resources they will need to use to accomplish their tasks. While it originated in universities, it is now also employed in businesses and classrooms. PBL also encourages collaborative and cooperative learning among students and their peers; students play the key role in encouraging learning in this collaborative setting. The objective is to conduct a research which is the best assessment technique for HCI subject either; 1)self assessment, 2)peer assessment or 3)group assessment in PBL application to assist UTeM students in answering PBL questions. This study is also to adopt an assessment technique as a testing tool for PBL application where lecturers are involved in evaluation before the final prototype is developed. Sample of students are second year of Faculty of Information and Communication Technology students in Interactive Media course pursuing Bachelor in Computer Science at Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka (UTeM).

In the effort to enable the nation to compete in the global arena during the knowledge-based era, the Malaysian government introduced the knowledge-based economy strategic plan. One of the thrust is to develop the public sector into a knowledge-based civil service, which directly affected public institutions of higher learning. Public universities must become a knowledge-driven university, a new educational identity which demanded a changing paradigm of the academicians. To be able to adapt to the new identity, academicians have to rely on their tacit knowledge. The research employs the grounded theory approach as the overarching methodology within a case site. Data are gathered through semi-structured interviews and twenty-four experienced academicians are interviewed using the critical incidences technique. Findings revealed that the academicians strategized by internalizing their (tacit) knowledge in their academic practices to adapt to the new educational identity. Three (tacit) knowledge internalization strategies are discovered, which are affirming intellectual capabilities, building interpersonal relationship and capitalizing on self-knowledge. Theoretically, this study contributes towards a theoretical model of knowledge internalization among the Malaysian academicians, besides contributing towards highlighting the action strategies imperative for the success of - n academician.","","POD:978-0-7695-3892-1","10.1109/ICCTD.2009.111","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5360188","","Computer science;Education;Educational institutions;Educational technology;Government;Humans;Information systems;Writing","economics;educational institutions","academic work practice;educational identity transformation;grounded theory;knowledge internalization;knowledge-based civil service;knowledge-based economy strategic plan;knowledge-driven university;public university","","0","","10","","","","13-15 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the two hybrid approaches, catalyst compositional models and catalytic reaction mechanism models are simultaneously constructed for correlating process data comprising values of input variables of catalyst compositional, operating conditions and output variables of performance of catalyst (catalyst selectivity and conversion). Next, in order to improve predictive accuracy and generalization ability of models, the structure and connection weights for ANN and three hyper-parameters for SVR are automatically optimized using chaos particle swarm optimization(CPSO). The CPSO possesses certain unique advantages over the commonly used GA and PSO optimization algorithms, which has high search efficiency, high precision and not the local optimum. The major advantage of the two hybrid strategies are that modeling can be conducted exclusively from the historic data wherein the detailed knowledge of process phenomenology (reaction mechanism, rate constants, etc.) is not required and difficult to get. Another advantage is that they have avoided the blindness and contingency of the traditional catalyst ""trial and error"" method. Finally, ANN-CPSO model and SVR-CPSO model were verified experimentally to be feasible, the forecasting values based on SVR-CPSO model were more close to the measured ones. The SVR-CPSO is a new soft computing methodology for heterogeneous catalysis modeling, which is more suitable for the non-linearity uncertainty, higher-dimension, chaos and small quantity of training data. The obtained results indicate that the SVR-CPSO model can be used as a promising alternative method for chemica- l process modeling.","","POD:978-1-4244-4754-1","10.1109/ICICISYS.2009.5357845","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5357845","chaotic particle swarm optimization;heterogeneous catalysis;modeling;neural networks;parameters optimization;support vector regression","Acceleration;Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Chaos;Costs;Input variables;Network synthesis;Neural networks;Particle swarm optimization;Predictive models","catalysis;chemical engineering computing;neural nets;particle swarm optimisation;regression analysis;support vector machines;syngas","ANN-CPSO model;STD process;SVR-CPSO model;artificial intelligence;catalyst compositional model;catalyst conversion;catalyst selectivity;catalytic reaction mechanism;chaotic particle swarm optimization;dimethyl ether;financial cost reduction;heterogeneous catalysis;industrialization synthesis;neural network;nonlinearity uncertainty;soft computing;support vector regression;syngas;temporal cost reduction","","0","","18","","","","20-22 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Learning can be facilitated by activating prior knowledge from an earlier class and/or context can be created for new material from previous experiences. Conversely, learning can be impeded by misconceptions that originate from personal experience, prior knowledge from previous classes, or inappropriate application of prior knowledge. Misconceptions from prior knowledge and previous experience can be classified according to their origin as a type of Â¿impedimentÂ¿ to learning for which there are two general types, each with subtypes. Null impediment refers to missing information (necessary for learning new material) due to students: (1) not having prior knowledge (deficiency) or; (2) not recognizing links between new material and their prior existing knowledge (transfer). Substantive impediment refers to faulty concept models students hold from: (1) personal experience or observations (experiential); (2) prior courses and teaching (pedagogic) and; (3) bending or misinterpreting of new concepts to fit prior knowledge (misinterpretive).

The grading system was designed to directly link a student's level of comprehension to his or her grade while maintaining the structure of a more traditional course. The grading system clarifies course expectations, helps students to see clearly where they need improvement, and assesses student's total achievement rather than their rate of achievement. Students are evaluated based on their progress with the learning objectives, primarily through quizzes and exams. Because traditional quizzes and exams are used, the assessment method can be implemented without affecting other instructional strategies.

Cao","Dept. of Education Information Technology East China Normal University Shanghai, China","2009 Fourth International Conference on Communications and Networking in China","20091120","2009","","","1","5","In a (t, n) threshold proxy signature scheme, one original signer delegates a group of n proxy signers to sign on behalf of the original signer. When the proxy signature is created, at least t proxy signers cooperate to produce valid proxy signatures and any less than t proxy signers can't cooperatively generate valid proxy signatures. Self-certified public key systems have attracted more and more attention because of its advantages. In 2005, Hsu and Wu designed a self-certified threshold proxy signature scheme with message recovery, nonrepudiation and traceability, which is based on Hsu et al.'s self-certified public key system. Park et al. showed that Hsu and Wu's self-certified threshold proxy signature scheme is insecure against the malicious original signer in 2006. That is, Hsu and Wu's scheme suffers from the cheat attack, where a malicious original signer can cheat CA into extracting a proxy signing key of a proxy signer. We analyzed Park et al's security analysis for Hsu and Wu's scheme and pointed out that the cheat attack proposed by Park et al. can't succeed. In one hand, in self-certified public system, users cannot freely change their private or public keys. If users want to change their private or public keys, CA has some corresponding strategy to limit users' behaviors. In the other hand, if some disagreement about the forged threshold proxy signature occurs, there are two solutions to deal with it. One solution depends on the help of CA and the other solution relies on the help of the delegated proxy signer.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-4337-6","10.1109/CHINACOM.2009.5339886","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5339886","Cryptography;Digital signatures;Proxy signature;Self-certified;threshold proxy signature","Computer science;Computer science education;Computer security;Digital signatures;Information security;Information technology;Protection;Public key;Sun;Systems engineering education","digital signatures;public key cryptography","HW threshold proxy signature scheme;Hsu-Wu security scheme;Park security analysis;digital signature;malicious original signer cheat attack;self-certified public key system","","0","","19","","","","26-28 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing proposals have not done enough work based on the two observations. In this paper, we propose DiffStream, a multi-channel dissemination strategy. In DiffStream, each channel disseminates partial streaming data instead of all, using MDC technology. Meanwhile, service differentiation is also achieved by treating different channels with varying priorities and regulating allocation of network resource to different channels in application layer.

In this paper we argue that a central factor agitating this problem is the tradition of teaching programming using a syntax perspective: Between the initial step of learning syntax, and the end step of achieving practical application, logic exists as a midpoint, representing the students' understanding. In this paper we propose the opposite strategy: We present a qualitative pilot study that within its initial findings indicate that through visualization, the logic component in the learning process can be empowered to facilitate an application perspective to achieve syntax. Previous research in the field shows that there is potential for using visualization to eliminate the obstacle of abstract problem-solving for students of programming. Our study uses the simple but multilayered bubble sort algorithm to examine how visualization can promote a theory of understanding that facilitates learning and comprehension through application rather than through syntax. The initial results of the pilot study indicate that there is definite potential for visualization to assist students of varying backgrounds when learning programming.","","POD:978-1-4244-4456-4","10.1109/ICADIWT.2009.5273943","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5273943","","Computer science;Education;Information systems;Logic programming;Mathematical programming;Problem-solving;Programming environments;Programming profession;Sorting;Visualization","computer science education","IT students;educational background;multilayered bubble sort algorithm","","0","","17","","","","4-6 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In classrooms lecturers are responsible for determining the content of the material they present. They impart this information to those who are there to learn. Additional to the fact that lecturers should act as facilitator in classrooms they also need to motivate the learner. In a more self-directed type of learning, such as e-learning, the learner has responsibility for his or her own learning. Overcoming the so-complicated process of learning by themselves they need also to be motivated. This paper depicts the experience of learning using a graphical based system modeled around the concept of VisuRule. It is based on an interactive interface implemented through a hierarchy of mutually exclusive options presented to the user based on choices made as the user progresses through the various decision levels. This strategy makes learning for students a more active process that is more meaningful and hence more effective.

'Management processes' set the strategy for 'demand/supply processes' which address health priority needs for quality of care services delivered via 'implementation processes'. These systems are very complex. Management processes involve many different perspectives, dimensions, objectives and systems, each with many states. Demand/supply processes involve numerous types of event chains, value streams and pathways of variable maturity, also with many states. Implementation processes involve several types of pathway flows, and interdependencies leading to decision tradeoffs. Taken together, these process variables and their states pose several billion process interaction options. This complexity complicates decision-making for optimizing health care benefits. A transparent common framework architecture has been developed within which all of these processes and their attributes and states many be inter-related and transparently navigated. It provides the ability to develop a common process knowledge base for understanding individual process events, pathway workflows, information flows, and value flows. It also facilitates assessment of key process interdependency tradeoffs that are required for business intelligence and informed management decision-making. A description of the framework, process operands and states is provided. An example illustrates an example of types of physiological/social tradeoffs for guiding breast cancer treatment options. A second example provides a navigation thread for prevention treatments such as vitamin D and related implications for adjustment of prevention, screening and diagnostic protocols.","","POD:978-1-4244-3928-7","10.1109/ITIME.2009.5236471","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5236471","","Biomedical informatics;Business;Decision making;Engineering management;Intellectual property;Marine technology;Navigation;Research and development management;Technology management;US Government","cancer;decision making;health care;information management;knowledge based systems;medical information systems;patient treatment;quality of service","breast cancer treatment;care informatics knowledge base framework;decision-making;demand-supply processes;diagnostic protocol;health care;health system;information flow;management processes;quality of care services;transparent common framework architecture","","0","","","","","","14-16 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Buy-sell strategy model construction with Hybrid XCS","S. Liu; F.

However, only with the forecasting value of the next time, it is difficult to determine the optimal buy-sell strategy and get benefit. On the other hand, because the financial time series change severely, it can hardly be identified by a single global model. One model will just be suitable for some kinds of changing patterns, but fail on other patterns. Then, in this paper, we proposed a Hybrid XCS (eXtended Classifier System) learning method by adopting multiple local models. Each local model is called Slaver-Agent and trained with XCS method. A unique Master-Agent chooses which Slaver-Agent is the most effectively for a given changing pattern. With the hybrid learning structure, multiple Slaver-Agents work alternately, and the limitation of learning by one single agent can be overcome. Their learning objective is to obtain profitable transaction decisions directly and get maximum return benefit after several transactions. Experiments have been performed on several well known securities, and the results have been compared with a single agent and some traditional Technical Analysis strategies.","","POD:978-1-4244-3520-3","10.1109/ICCSE.2009.5228506","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5228506","Buy-Sell Strategy;Financial Time Series;Hybrid XCS;XCS","Artificial neural networks;Chemical technology;Economic forecasting;Educational institutions;Information science;Learning systems;Master-slave;Neural networks;Predictive models;Stock markets","financial data processing;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;stock markets","buy-sell strategy model construction;financial time series forecasting techniques;hybrid extended classifier system learning method;hybrid learning structure;learning objective;master-agent model;profitable transaction decisions;slaver-agent model;stock prices prediction","","0","","18","","","","25-28 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The unscented particle filter uses the unscented Kalman filter to generate particles in the particle filtering framework. This method can give better performance than the standard particle filter in some practical problems that are raised in computer vision field. But one critical issue in the unscented particle filter is that it has very high computational complexity which constrains its broader application. In this paper, we give an improvement strategy aiming at reducing the computational complexity of the algorithm. This strategy combines the general framework of particle filtering with the transition prior and the unscented Kalman filter, taking advantage of the low computational complexity of the standard particle filter and the high estimation accuracy of the unscented particle filter. The experimental results show that this strategy can reduce the running time cost of the unscented particle filter greatly without loss of accuracy.","","POD:978-1-4244-3520-3","10.1109/ICCSE.2009.5228418","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5228418","particle filter;sampling strategy;unscentd Kalman filter","Computational complexity;Computer science;Computer vision;Costs;Educational technology;Filtering;Particle filters;Proposals;Radar tracking;Sampling methods","Kalman filters;computational complexity;computer vision;particle filtering (numerical methods);signal sampling","computational complexity;computer vision;sampling strategy;unscented Kalman filter;unscented particle filter","","3","","11","","","","25-28 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As sensor network own its characteristics, the traditional congestion control strategy can't be used directly any longer. Most of the existing congestion control strategies and algorithms are not fully considered RTT. At the same time as the actual sensor network operating in the nonlinear, time delays and time-varying parameters such as interference factors, if the controller design parameters are fixed, not learning ability, then the actual running of the convergence is poor, slow convergence, not to control the length of queue. For the above-mentioned problems, the controller which is based on gray predicted neural network is proposed to cope with the large delays and time-varying network parameters. The gray GM (1, 1) model is utilized to compensate the time-delay, while RBF neural network is employed to design controller to reduce the number and interaction of tuning parameter. The simulation experimental results show that the integrated performance of the proposed algorithm is obviously superior to that of the existing schemes when the network configuration parameter is largely delayed.","","POD:978-1-4244-3520-3","10.1109/ICCSE.2009.5228446","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5228446","GM (1, 1);Gray prediction;RBF;Wireless sensor network;congestion control","Capacitive sensors;Computer networks;Computer science;Convergence;Delay effects;Educational technology;Interference;Neural networks;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","delays;grey systems;neurocontrollers;radial basis function networks;telecommunication congestion control;time-varying systems;wireless sensor networks","RBF-GM controller;congestion control strategy;gray predicted neural network;radial basis function;time delays;time-varying parameter;wireless sensor network","","1","","11","","","","25-28 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mobile search is quite different from standard PC-based web search in a number of ways: (a) the user interfaces and I/O are limited by screen real estate, (b) key pads are tiny and inconvenient for use, (c) limited bandwidth and (d) costly connection fees. These limitations result in more navigational queries in the mobile search. Furthermore, user location, activities, preferences, and interaction history can also improve accuracy in determining relevance for mobile search. In the past, most personalized search algorithms are studied in the context of PC-based web search. Personalized mobile search should however play a bigger role at improving the user experiences. This paper focuses on the personalization strategies which explicitly and implicitly infer user search context at individual user level. We propose an architecture which collects user information (at mobile device and carrier network) and derives user intention in given situations. We show that personalized mobile search perform well for ambiguous queries and localized searches.","","POD:978-0-7695-3507-4","10.1109/CSIE.2009.718","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5170550","Context Awareness;Mobile Search;Personalized Search;User Profile","Computer science;Computer science education;Educational technology;Entropy;Hardware;History;Mobile computing;Navigation;Search engines;Web search","Internet;mobile computing","PC-based Web search;ambiguous queries;interaction history;localized search;mobile users;navigational queries;personalization strategies;personalized approach;personalized mobile search;personalized search algorithm;user information;user interface;user location;user search context","","2","1","15","","","","March 31 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The dynamic urban land sampling framework (DULSF) is first investigated, in which three parts were built and implemented that: (1) a dynamic changed urban land regionalization (DCULR) in the case area based on the dynamic urban land change degree (ULCD); (2) a dynamic spatial information and sampling framework (DSISF) based on different urban land change rate; and (3) a dynamic changed urban land sampling units (DCULSU). And a crucial metric that dynamic urban land change degrees of sampling unit (DULCDSU) was proposed in the dynamic urban land sampling framework. A dynamic urban land change sampling (ULCS) scheme was then generated while the valid samples were determined, sample distribution strategy was disposed, and accuracy prior and post assessment was carried out.

For the purpose of complex task, chains distributed atom service together is a possible solution. How to link spatial information services quickly, efficiently and adaptively is quite important. This paper presents a model for chaining spatial services by employing Web Processing Service (WPS) and Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL4WS) under the service-oriented architecture (SOA) and OGC standard. Workflow control and SQL Server based register center were employed for chaining spatial services which have been performed functionality decomposition and packed by using extended WPS. For adaptive services chaining in this model, atom service was packed as spatial agent (SA); and statues of single service was monitored. Negotiation strategy was brought in to balance statue (such as servicepsilas prerequisite, time consuming etc.) of multi-SA (exception handling) in services chain for choosing best service to be linked by standard interfaces.","","POD:978-0-7695-3563-0","10.1109/ETTandGRS.2008.64","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5070331","BPEL4WS;OGC;WPS;services chain;spatial agent;spatial information service","Artificial intelligence;Educational institutions;Educational technology;Geographic Information Systems;Geoscience and remote sensing;ISO standards;Kernel;Service oriented architecture;Standards organizations;Web services","Web services;business data processing;information services","Business Process Execution Language;SQL server based register center;Web processing service;adaptive services chaining;atom service;interoperating spatial information;negotiation strategy;reference specifications;service-oriented architecture;spatial agent;spatial information service model;standard interface;workflow control","","1","","28","","","","21-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An analysis of this gap has shown that two key causes for the research-practice gap are lack of effective communication and the relatively light coverage of requirements engineering material in University programmes. We discuss the design and delivery of a masters course in software requirements engineering (SRE) that is designed to overcome some of the issues that have caused the research-practice gap. By encouraging students to share their experiences in a peer learning environment, we aim to improve shared understanding between students (many of whom are current industry practitioners) and researchers (including academic staff members) to improve the potential for effective collaborations, whilst simultaneously developing the requirements engineering skill sets of the enrolled students. Feedback from students in the course is discussed and directions for the future development of the curriculum and learning strategies are given.","","POD:978-1-4244-3770-2","10.1109/ITNG.2009.134","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5070698","Requirements engineering;research-practice","Cause effect analysis;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Communication effectiveness;Design engineering;Education;Feedback;Information technology;Medical services;Peer to peer computing","computer aided instruction;computer science education;formal specification","peer learning;research-practice gap;software requirements engineering;teaching","","7","","26","","","","27-29 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Integrated projects would be a good opportunity to practice this concept if it had been better direction to this objective since it is a longer project that is supported by many chairs. Those projects use to presents the business rules and requirements to the students withdrawing from them the chance to exercises the domain and requirement engineering. It was made an experience to close that gap, so, 20 students were asked to get the requirements to a project. It was expected that the students should got requirements using the use case approach, also, they should realizes the need of domain engineering to empower the requirement's elicitation process. The need of this realization is based on the learning strategy used on the experience called problem-based learning (PBL) where the students should find solutions to a stated problem even before the presentation of the proper concepts that best solves the problem, so, in this study the need of domain engineering was not formally defined. To perform the strategy, the problem should had defined in a way which avoids the student's business rules intuitive inferences, so, it was defined a problem in an unknown domain. Another property of the problem is that should be a unique distributed system sharing the same business rules even the groups had different requirements. It was expected that the students got the requirements and realizes the need of domain engineering from a high level stakeholders' need in a 18 weeks time frame. Despite this, the students neither got requirements neither realizes the domain engineering needs during the first 5 weeks (27% of the time frame) they just had asking to the professor ""which are the requirements?"" and did not performed any requirements procedures. Supposing a conceptual problem, the use case approach concep- ts were retrieved, but it were realized that there were not a conceptual problem, so, the next logical step is consider concept's transfer problems. It was performed a transfer procedure where starting from a high level need, going through the approach till got the first classes of a rental software system (a well know domain to focuses the approach) the domain engineering aspects are commented as demanded by the students. During the transfer, the students tried to just create the requirements on a intuitively way on this time, they had been pushed back to follow the approach and get the requirements using it. During this activity, they once again, tried to escape from the procedure outweigh the lack of business rules just intuitively creating them, once again, they were induced to obtain and elicit the business rules and not just create them. The second part of the induction was very important since it was used to instigate on the students the curiosity about the domain engineering becoming a start point to the solution's search as defined by PBL. Once the transfer procedure was accomplished, the students started to ask the ""correct questions"" and the project could be started. After this point, the students should realizes the need of a unified domain engineering to the whole project positioning themselves as parts of the system, once again it did not happened and a new transfer procedure was made. In this transfer procedure was enough just help the students retrieve the distributed system's concepts and help them to identify each module and their position on them. During the transfer procedure the professor realizes that the students did not considered the modules communications and they had started to create incompatible modules leading the professor to start a new induction to solve this problem. From this point to the end, the project had a normal development.

It is very important to calculate a number of near-optimal routes for the fusion nodes that incrementally collect the data. Based on the multi-tier mobile network model, a new moving control strategy is proposed. This method first divides the monitoring field into several sub-regions so that fusion nodes can collect data in their own parts respectively. Then fusion nodes use constraints-based mobile localization (CML) algorithm to calculate the location information of each sensor node. Finally a new maximum likelihood nearest neighbor (MLNN) algorithm is proposed to design optimal routes for fusion nodes.

So the research on structure and characters of networks will improve the search speed and lower the load of nodes. Though getting the shortest paths is the best choice, in a real network, it is impossible for a node to get global information. For example, there is not a node that has the whole network information in a peer-to-peer network. The shortest paths are available, but the cost, especially in a dynamical network, will be high. The paper first discusses the main characters of complex network and the existing searching strategies with local information, and then defines and analyzes maximum diffuse nodes. After evaluating the stability of maximum diffuse nodes in dynamical network, the paper designs searching strategy based on maximum diffuse principle. To validate the idea, we numerically simulate the most characteristic complex network model of Barabasi and Albert (BA model), and analyze the average path, the network average load and every nodepsilas load in different initial parameter values.

In the retrieval process, images are segmented three layers, raw pixel layer, blob feature layer and global image layer, and retrieval process is refined gradually. Moreover similarity between images is measured with an approximation of the earth moverpsilas distance (EMD), which quickly computes minimal-cost correspondences between sets of signatures.

In grinding and deburring, a human expert moves a tool at an optimal feedrate and cutting force as well as with an appropriate compliance for holding the tool. An experienced worker can select the correct strategy for performing a task and change it dynamically in accordance with the task process state. In this paper, the human expertise for selecting a task strategy that accords with the process characteristics is modeled as an associative mapping, and represented and generated by using a neural network. First, the control strategy for manipulating a tool is described in terms of feedforward inputs and tool holding dynamics. The parameters and variables representing the control strategy are then identified by using teaching data taken from a demonstration by an expert. The task process is also modeled and characterized by a set of parameters, which are identified by using this same teaching data. Combining the two sets of identified parameters, we can derive an associative mapping from the task process characteristics to the task strategy parameters. Using a nueral network, this associative mapping is generated through learning operations. The method is applied to grinding, and implemented on a direct-drive robot. It is shown that the robot is able to associate a correct control strategy with process characteristics in a manner similar to that of the human expert.","","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4791236","","Character generation;Deburring;Education;Educational robots;Humans;Intelligent robots;Machining;Mechanical engineering;Mechanical systems;Psychology","","","","3","","15","","","","23-25 May 1990","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Behavior of each individual is driven by temporal situation of the system and individualpsilas anticipation with respect to future decisions of other individuals, which can be calculated from individualspsila properties, such as strategy-sets, profit functions, beliefs about history information and future situation, and so on. Some learning rules, e.g. reinforcement learning, are also discussed for updating individualspsila properties during evolution of the system. Cellular Automata is employed in the frame to compute and observe the visualized long-term behaviors of the system at higher group level. Experiments show that the modelled collective systems with certain learning schemes can reach some balanced state under restrictive conditions. Our framework is helpful for study of modelling and simulating social dynamic systems, and researching higher-level behaviors of collective system with learning techniques.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2511-2; POD:978-1-4244-2510-5","10.1109/ITME.2008.4743861","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4743861","","Cognitive science;Computational modeling;Educational technology;Game theory;Humans;Learning;Mathematical model;Medical simulation;Neurons;Predictive models","behavioural sciences computing;cellular automata;cognitive systems;learning (artificial intelligence)","cellular automata;collective learning behaviors;learning rules;reinforcement learning;social dynamic systems","","0","","16","","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It shows that the overall efficiency of Australian universities maintains at a high level. Furthermore, the investigation reveals that there is a positive relationship between the improvements in teaching efficiency of Australian universities and the introduction of a major government funding policy related to the university teaching performance. A group-based multi-period data envelopment analysis conducted on the performance of universities shows that teaching oriented universities and so-called innovative universities react positively more to the new funding policies than traditionally research intensive universities do. Such findings provide useful insights for the government and universities on how to improve their efficiency in relation to the formulation and development of specific strategies and policies.","","POD:978-0-7695-3508-1","10.1109/CIS.2008.213","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724705","","Australia;Computational intelligence;Data envelopment analysis;Data security;Education;Educational institutions;Information security;Information technology;Performance analysis;US Government","data envelopment analysis;education;educational institutions;government policies;teaching","Australian universities;government policies;innovative universities;multiperiod data envelopment analysis;teaching oriented universities;university teaching performance","","0","","34","","","","13-17 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the most advanced firms the CIO is the best indicated executive to move to CEO, especially in technology intensive firms. He has become the key Schumpeterian actor in the creative-destructive process mediated by technology. Today technology is the single greatest factor in strategic change in a firm. The CIO is the executive best positioned to manage the creative-destructive power of technology as outlined by Schumpeter and effect firm sustainability in the face of massive changes in markets. Thus the CIO is the best positioned to craft corporate strategy. As such he is best positioned to take advantage. This paper outlines this new and evolving role as determined from interviews of industry, and public sector CIOs and chief technology officers (CTOs) and the study of CIO and CTO position advertisements. Nineteen CIOs and nine CTOs were interviewed for this research project. The emerging picture is that of a new dynamic role for the CIO with new competencies, roles and responsibilities, which vary by sector and organization type and size. This paper presents the new competencies, roles and responsibilities in light of the overwhelming importance of technology to firm sustainability.

This paper first reviews the relevant literature in order to isolate the age group in which the difference is most prevalent, and then identifies the learning strategies that seem to cause the largest difference. The results of students taking a second-year college theoretical mathematical course are then compared to those of students in a third-year college IT course, so as to explain why female students performed better in the mathematical course than in the IT course. Possible causes for the differences are isolated to inform the learning strategy that has subsequently been adopted for the IT course. The main difference between the courses was predicted to be that students may have not been aware of all that was expected of them or that they needed guidance to overcome initial obstacles faced in learning programming. Statistical analysis of the results reveals that female student distributions among the different grade sectors are positively affected by the new approach.

In this paper, an innovative approach to seamless integration of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and multi-agent system (MAS) is proposed. In order to generate a test paper automatically, a modified genetic particle swarm optimization (GPSO) is presented, in which the values of parameters will be decreased linearly with the number of iterations for improving the late convergence rate. For the implementation of GPSO based on multi-agent system, a core agents TPAgent (TPA) is provided to undertake the operations of GPSO and will control the evolution operations of each generation of population. To keep communication between different nodes at a minimum cost, fitness evaluation tasks are implemented by the TPAgents at local nodes, only the local minimum fitness and the corresponding best particle are sent to center node so as to get the global best particle in the parallel computing environment. For avoiding the prematurity, the global best particle will be dispatched to remote node randomly. Based on the JADE, a prototype system is setup , and the simulation results show that the proposed approach is feasible and robust.","1089-778X;1089778X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1823-7; POD:978-1-4244-1822-0","10.1109/CEC.2008.4631085","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4631085","","Area measurement;Automatic testing;Communication system control;Convergence;Distance learning;Genetics;Intelligent systems;Multiagent systems;Particle swarm optimization;System testing","computer aided instruction;distance learning;genetic algorithms;multi-agent systems;parallel processing;particle swarm optimisation","GPSO;JADE;MAS;PSO;TPA;TPAgent;Web-based distance education;Web-based test;agent-oriented design;genetic particle swarm optimization;intelligent test paper generation;learners' knowledge;multi agent system;parallel computing;particle swarm optimization","","6","","9","","","","1-6 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A study on the applications of information-sharing concepts to the teaching in elementary school","Huan-Ming Chuang; Chia-Cheng Shen","Department of Information Management, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Taiwan","2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","20080905","2008","1","","174","179","Shared and retrieval are used for knowledge exchange in learning-groups. Whether a student is willing to contribute knowledge to a shared system presents a educational dilemma: Each student saves time and energy by not contributing any information to the system and by using the system only to retrieve information which was contributed by others. But if all students use this strategy, then the system will be empty and, hence, useless for every student. Based on theoretical approaches, one model for fostering the information-sharing behavior of system students are presented in education. Our empirical study examined the influence of information-sharing on learning outcome and learner satisfaction in e-learning environments. Three different settings were studied: two were e-learning environments - with information-sharing, and non-information-sharing. The third was the traditional classroom environment. Results of the experiment showed that the value of knowledge management for learning effectiveness was contingent upon the provision of information-sharing. Students in the e-learning environment that provided information-sharing achieved significantly better learning performance and a higher level of learner satisfaction than those in other settings. However, students who used the e-learning environment that provided non-information-sharing did not improve either. The findings suggest that it may be important to integrate information-sharing into e-learning systems.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620399","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620399","Collaborative learning;Computer-mediated communication;Information-sharing;Knowledge management;e-learning","Context;Cybernetics;Education;Educational institutions;Electronic learning;Information analysis;Information management;Information retrieval;Knowledge management;Machine learning","computer aided instruction;distance learning;groupware;knowledge management;teaching","collaborative learning;e-learning;elementary school;information-sharing concept;knowledge exchange;knowledge management;teaching","","0","","16","","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Corporate E-Learning Centre (CELC), at Anahuac Mexico Sur University, has made some efforts to implement different approaches for training teachers in ICTs. The first approach consisted of training teachers in the collaborative learning strategy using the technology tools of a learning management system. The second approach consisted of personalised training in a controlled space and with specific tools for teachers courses. This second approach was concluded with the creation of a laboratory called CEIC lab, which has an ergonomic-didactic layout. The third approach is described in this project and unites the experiences and results of the previous two approaches. This third approach called u-training combines instructional design, e-commerce, marketing, ICTs, a metric control programme and a reward management programme to create a ubiquitous training portal so that teacher training can be available anywhere and anytime.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3163-2","10.1109/ICIW.2008.27","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4545590","Metric Control Programme;Reward Management Programme;U-Training;e-Learning","Collaborative work;Communications technology;Educational programs;Electronic learning;Laboratories;Management training;Marketing management;Portals;Space technology;Technology management","computer based training;electronic commerce;ergonomics;groupware;portals;teacher training;ubiquitous computing","CEIC lab;collaborative learning strategy;e-commerce;ergonomic-didactic layout;higher education teachers;higher educational training programmes;information and communication technologies;instructional design;learning management system;marketing;metric control programme;personalised training;reward management programme;teacher training strategies;teachers courses;ubiquitous training portals","","0","","13","","","","8-13 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

E-learning technologies offer learners control over content, learning sequence, pace of learning, time, and often media, allowing them to tailor their experiences to meet their personal learning objectives. In diverse medical education contexts, e-learning appears to be at least as effective as traditional instructor-led methods such as lectures. Students do not see e-learning as replacing traditional instructor- led training but as a complement to it, forming part of a blended- learning strategy. A developing infrastructure to support e-learning within medical education includes repositories, or digital libraries, to manage access to e-learning materials, consensus on technical standardization, and methods for peer review of these resources. E-learning presents numerous research opportunities for faculty, along with continuing challenges for documenting scholarship. Innovations in e-learning technologies point toward a revolution in education, allowing learning to be individualized (adaptive learning), enhancing learners' interactions with others (collaborative learning), and transforming the role of the teacher. The integration of e-learning into medical education can catalyze the shift toward applying adult learning theory, where educators will no longer serve mainly as the distributors of content, but will become more involved as facilitators of learning and assessors of competency.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1752-0; POD:978-1-4244-1751-3","10.1109/ICTTA.2008.4529968","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529968","Internet2;digital libraries;e-learning;e-portfolios;learning management system;medical education;portals;web-based instructions","Collaborative work;Educational technology;Electronic learning;Internet;Management training;Resource management;Scholarships;Software libraries;Standardization;Technological innovation","biomedical education;computer aided instruction;teaching","Internet;adaptive learning;digital libraries;e-learning materials;e-learning techniques;learning management system;medical education","","0","","23","","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is easy to trigger the problem of topic drift. To overcome this weak point, the present paper puts forward firstly the strategy of establishing a three-order adjacency tensor on the 3-dimensional relationship between the seed document, simple document and the author. Secondly, the adjacency tensor is decomposed to obtain the principal component in each dimension. Thirdly, the semantic similarity between authors is defined.

While the first is executed by computing semantic similarity between the sentence and the query, and the other is executed by using semantic graph. Then these two kinds of features are blessed to score each sentence. At last with the help of MMR for reducing redundancy, we get the summary.

More advanced engineers (Mechanical Engineering graduate students) were also interviewed about their mathematical training. The interview responses were analyzed using grounded theory methodology, and the emergent themes were mapped to Schoenfeld's aspects of mathematical thinking: knowledge base, heuristics, monitoring and control mechanisms, beliefs and affects and practices. The emerging findings suggest that engineering students learn problem solving strategies, develop beliefs and feelings about mathematics and engineering, acquire self-monitoring abilities and develop practices as a result of their experiences in their mathematics courses.

Students are required to write a research paper that describes why a certain material is used for a particular product; also, it must include an in-depth analysis of the materials properties that are needed for function. Student must reveal what they conceptually know since they have to articulate why a certain material is chosen over another material, or why a new material has replaced another. Thus, those research papers contain a wealth of information about how students think about materials and on a level that is not possible to explore with concept questions or interviews.

The limited classroom time with students over the summer forces the design of the curriculum to be concise and comprehensive, yet engaging. The curriculum includes basic and intermediate courses with content in Computer Programming, Web Design, Computer Systems, and Mathematics. This work in progress describes the preliminary design and implementation processes and focuses on what should be taught and to a lesser degree the pedagogy. TLI provides an avenue for students to learn about the vast scope of Computer Science, educational and career opportunities, in addition to obtaining transferable knowledge and skills. The curriculum is assessed by an external evaluation team that will collect, analyze and report student-identified competency, student perceptions and interests, as well as actual achievement levels.

We consider bilateral teleoperation of a wheeled mobile robot. Our main objective is to combine position-speed command strategy, which is usual for mobile robot control, with position-position command strategy. Generally teleoperation scheme has two control modes, which are position-speed mode and position-position mode. In position-speed mode, a master haptic manipulator's position defines the linear velocity and heading angle of the mobile robot. In position-position mode, the position of the robot is controlled based on the position of the master device. In this paper we propose a strategy to adapt a reasonable control mode automatically. Sonar sensors were used to detect obstacle range information, which is the source of force feedback to human operator. Developed scheme was tested with numerical simulations and experiments. The different types of navigation tasks were evaluated. Productivity, accuracy and usability of hybrid control strategy are analyzed.

Resorting to the self-organizing, structured overlay network, the anonymous strategy does not need a administrant node. Because of the opening character of overlay network, the relation on the expected value of rerouting path length and forward probability, and the relation on the degree of anonymity and the number of malicious nodes are analyzed in this paper. Moreover, the probability, which malicious nodes find the initiator, is increasing with the rounds which the initiator builds the rerouting path. The calculation result demonstrates that descending forward probability makes the expected value of rerouting path length decreases distinctly, therefore limits the communication delay.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1386-7; POD:978-1-4244-1385-0","10.1109/ISITAE.2007.4409353","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4409353","Anonymous Communication;Overlay network;Rerouting","Buildings;Computer networks;Data communication;Fault tolerance;Information security;Internet;Peer to peer computing;Performance analysis;Protection;Routing","Internet;peer-to-peer computing;probability;protocols;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security","fault tolerant substrate;forward probability;rerouting-based anonymous communication protocol;structured peer-to-peer overlay network","","0","","8","","","","23-25 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a role-based intelligent mobile care system with alert mechanism in chronic care environment is proposed and implemented. The roles in our system include patients, physicians, nurses, and healthcare providers. Each of the roles represents a person that uses a mobile device such as a mobile phone to communicate with the server setup in the care center such that he or she can go around without restrictions. For commercial mobile phones with Bluetooth communication capability attached to chronic patients, we have developed physiological signal recognition algorithms that were implemented and built-in in the mobile phone without affecting its original communication functions. It is thus possible to integrate several front-end mobile care devices with Bluetooth communication capability to extract patients' various physiological parameters [such as blood pressure, pulse, saturation of haemoglobin (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and electrocardiogram (ECG)], to monitor multiple physiological signals without space limit, and to upload important or abnormal physiological information to healthcare center for storage and analysis or transmit the information to physicians and healthcare providers for further processing. Thus, the physiological signal extraction devices only have to deal with signal extraction and wireless transmission. Since they do not have to do signal processing, their form factor can be further reduced to reach the goal of microminiaturization and power saving. An alert management mechanism has been included in back-end healthcare center to initiate various strategies for automatic emergency alerts after receiving emergency messages or after automatically recognizing emergency messages. Within the - - time intervals in system setting, according to the medical history of a specific patient, our prototype system can inform various healthcare providers in sequence to provide healthcare service with their reply to ensure the accuracy of alert information and the completeness of early warning notification to further improve the healthcare quality. In the end, with the testing results and performance evaluation of our implemented system prototype, we conclude that it is possible to set up a complete intelligent health care chain with mobile monitoring and healthcare service via the assistance of our system.","1089-7771;10897771","","10.1109/TITB.2006.888701","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4300837","Alert;Bluetooth;Java programming;mobile care;mobile phone;ubiquitous","Biomedical monitoring;Bluetooth;Condition monitoring;Data mining;Medical services;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Patient monitoring;Prototypes;Signal processing","Bluetooth;diseases;health care;knowledge based systems;mobile computing;mobile radio;patient care;patient monitoring;telemedicine","Bluetooth communication;alert mechanism;arrhythmia;back-end healthcare center;chronic care environment;chronic diseases;emergency messages;front-end mobile care devices;health education;healthcare quality;healthcare service;hypertension;information analysis;information storage;information transmission;mobile care system;mobile phone communication;patient monitoring;physiological parameters;physiological signal recognition algorithm;professional medical care;role-based intelligent mobile care system;signal extraction devices;wireless transmission","Cellular Phone;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography, Ambulatory;Feasibility Studies;Heart Diseases;Humans;Mobile Health Units;Pilot Projects;Remote Consultation;Taiwan","107","","16","","","","Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Student success is important to retention, and one of the premises of this study is that meeting the challenges of demanding curricula often requires more than innate intelligence. To explore this assumption, two intrapersonal variables rarely studied in the computing field were measured: coping strategies and emotional intelligence as contributors to within-major grade point average (GPA). Based on data collected from 613 upper-level undergraduate students enrolled at multiple universities in the USA, the effects of coping strategies and emotional intelligence on academic performance were tested, with self-efficacy (SE) used as a covariate. The results indicate that SE is related to academic success for computing students. Emotional intelligence does predict SE for computing students. However, computing and noncomputing majors differed significantly on emotional intelligence and the ldquoaccommodationrdquo coping strategy. Further, the ldquochange the situationrdquo coping strategy was directly linked to academic success for noncomputing students, but not for computing students.

A survey was conducted of 30 near-graduate and recent graduates of various engineering disciplines asking their motivations for choosing their particular field. From experiences on a university campus, the most effective recruiters are those who actively go after students by: providing meaningful co-op/internship experience as well as by being involved with on-campus information sessions and events.

The IETF Delay Tolerant Network Research Group is developing protocols to enable such networks for a broad variety of Earth and interplanetary applications. The Arctic would benefit from a predictive velocity-enabled version of DTN that would facilitate communications between sparse, ephemeral, often mobile and extremely power-limited nodes. We propose to augment DTN with power-aware, buffer-aware location- and time-based predictive routing for ad-hoc meshes to create networks that are inherently location and time (velocity) aware at the network level to support climate research, emergency services and rural education in the Arctic. On Earth, the primary source of location and universal time information for networks is the Global Positioning System (GPS). We refer to this Arctic velocity-enabled Delay-Tolerant Network protocol as ""GPSDTN"" accordingly.

In this study the value-focused thinking (VFT) [4] method, which filtered out the invalid data and built the customer concerns associated relationships to visualize the text data, was used to avoid this kind of problem. This opportunity map helped him understand the information. We not only discovered the predictable opportunity based on the associated relationships, but also defined the rare opportunity according to the entropy of keywords' link. The short wavelength laser diode as blue-ray, an important strategic factor, was considered as the important technology in the next generation according to the analyst's experience. An associated map was built from a model based on the KeyGraph method using around 1000 DVD news collected from 1996 to 2004. Finally, according to the analyst's demand both the strategic factor (blue-ray) and the links, connecting to other keywords in the associated map, were emerged in our model. As a result, ""Toshiba' was connected with the blue-ray, which meant ""Toshiba' had the chance to be the leader of DVD industry in the next generation. The events in the low occurring area were hardly discovered by previous methods. We proposed the entropy of keywords' link and defined the rare opportunities, which has resulted the discovery of many rare but important keywords. These keywords are as the strategic factors emerging and connecting with other keywords in associated (opportunity) map. In the experiment, ""JVC was found to be the rare but important keyword, standing for the rare opportunity. Almost all important enterprises and technologies were connected with ""JVC"". It indicates that ""JVC had enough resources to adopt the global strategy and became the leaders of DVD industry in the next era.

This includes the challenges in designing intelligent engineering systems to reduce false positives and increases detection capability of intrusion detection systems (IDSs). The high percentage of alerts and false positives generated by IDSs are among the significant problems. We present intelligent systems architecture and integration, including risk management and validation for reduction of false positives and infrastructure protection using a novel approach using adaptive responses from firewall packet filters in what we call, network quarantine channels (NQC). This includes risk assessments and design of integrated virtual private networks (VPNs) and strategic controls via packet filters, which collaborate with the NQC to reply to suspicious hosts, and them deny access to sensitive data servers in the infrastructure. The firewall packet filters provide effective intelligent responses by to granting access to the normal packets and denying malicious traffic access to the network, after the identity of the connections are verified through the statistical analysis in the NQC. These effective strategies reduce false positives and increases detection capability of the IDS. The intelligent systems at the system-of-systems level include systems modeling and simulation, systems engineering education, training, quality management for intrusion detection, computer security and disaster response. The validation includes statistical analysis and modeling of systems integration for handling large-scale and complex systems in emerging commercial networks. This includes large-scale systems integration various applications for technology transfer between academia and industry, and applicable to communications systems, medical systems, management and sustainability.

In a cognitive activity such as learning, communication (between learners and tutors) is one of the fundamental issues, and its quality may influence the learning. Therefore, learning process implies cognitive aspects as well as socio-emotional aspects: in real world, teaching also implies to observe the student's affective behavior in order to detect affective responses which can express interest, excitation, confusion, etc. and suggest a review of the actual interaction flow.

What has been the conventional teacher-centred approach is now seeing a shift into one which emphasises on student-centred learning. Traditional educational content can now be transformed into interactive multimedia content by using authoring packages. It has enabled the teacher to innovate his/her instructional design by presenting the educational content in an interactive and multi- sensory manner rather than the traditional single media format. This infusion of multimedia into teaching and learning has altered instructional strategies in educational institutions. Hence, with the advent of this pervasive information technology, many colleges and universities, including those in Malaysia, are currently gearing their teaching and learning towards one which uses multimedia technology to enhance the student's learning process. With the availability of the devices such as the CD and Internet, in particular the World Wide Web, interactive learning instructions can be delivered to the learners in an asynchronous learning environment. The purpose of the research is to do a comparative study on the impact on student learning when interactive multimedia educational content is delivered to the second year students of the Film & Animation course of Multimedia University via the CD and the Web. A set of instructional materials were developed, implemented and the learners' perception and attitudes towards the use of these multimedia learning instructions recorded.

The development of an ITS is often criticized for being a complex and challenging process as individual students' needs change and often they do not realize that they need help. Consequently, such a system must be capable of dynamically adapting and monitoring each student, developing a model of their knowledge, skills and expertise. Based on the learner student model, an ITS must present instructional strategies in terms of both the content and the style, and provides explanations and practice problems as needed. The advances in the development of the computer technologies has facilitated the use and design of ITS. Nevertheless, ITS research progress has been impeded by the lack of modular system architectures, reusable components and sharable knowledge bases. Each new research or development effort typically starts from scratch, without a foundation on which to build. In this paper some of the actual limiting problems of the ITS are studied. The main contribution of this work is resumed in a proposed framework. The framework incorporates a knowledge base where data and knowledge related to the problem are maintained and a model related to the student, teaching and environmental issues together with pedagogical perspectives. We consider in the ITS context the agents' technology for address issues of modularity and reusability; and Case-Based Reasoning to store students' interactions and feedback with the ITS, in order to maintain past memory experiences and then derive new paths for teaching.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0406-1; POD:1-4244-0405-3","10.1109/ITHET.2006.339795","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141658","","Computer architecture;Computerized monitoring;Control systems;Costs;Education;Feedback;Impedance;Intelligent structures;Intelligent systems;Virtual reality","case-based reasoning;intelligent tutoring systems;teaching","case-based reasoning;instructional strategy;intelligent tutoring system;learner student model;one-on-one instruction;student feedback;student interaction;teaching","","1","","22","","","","10-13 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Especially in rural area in China, it is more useful than traditional web-based learning application for the lack of computers. However, the transition from traditional web-based Learning system to IPTV-based learning is not trivial for the limited input and control capabilities of the devices such as the keyboard and mouse. It is a challenge task to design an IPTV oriented E-Learning system and deliver web-based learning resources to the new IPTV platform. In this paper we study the learning process on IPTV platform and present the design methodology of an interactive IPTV-based E-Learning system. Several critical issues have been investigated carefully. At first a service framework for IPTV based E-Learning service is introduced. The interoperability with other traditional web-based learning system is enabled by the introduction of several interfaces based on Web Services. Then new development methods of IPTV-Oriented learning resources are then proposed. In addition, conversion strategies for traditional web-based learning resources to IPTV platform are also discussed. Thirdly we proposed the design methodologies for the learning interactivity, which is the key feature of IPTV-based application comparing to traditional VOD ones. To evaluate the framework and the methodology that we have proposed, a prototype IPTV-based learning service is developed.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0406-1; POD:1-4244-0405-3","10.1109/ITHET.2006.339809","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141672","Design methodology;Interactive E-Learning System;Internet Protocol TV(IPTV);Service Framework","Application software;Control systems;Design methodology;Electronic learning;IPTV;Keyboards;Learning systems;Mice;TV;Web services","IP networks;Web services;computer aided instruction;digital television;interactive systems","Web-based Learning;e-learning system;interactive IPTV;interoperability;learning resources","","2","","","","","","10-13 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Difficulties experienced by novice programmers in introductory programming courses include deficiencies in problem-solving strategies, misconceptions relating to programming language constructs and the use of traditional programming environments. An introductory programming course should offer students problem solving analysis and design experience as well as exposure to the basic ideas of algorithmic thinking. Generally, introductory programming courses tend to concentrate on the syntax of a programming language at the expense of developing problem solving skills. Coupled to this are the ever-increasing complexity of modern programming languages and the user interfaces of their IDEs. A strategy that addresses the difficulties experienced by novice programmers in introductory programming courses is one that modifies the teaching model, specifically within the context of technological support. One way of implementing this strategy is with the use of visual programming languages, of which the iconic flowchart approach is one. Further, iconic programming environments traditionally attempt to simplify the programming task by reducing the level of precision and manual typing usually required in the conventional textual programming languages. These environments also attempt to increase the speed at which problem-solving and implementation efforts occur. Consequently, B# was developed in order to provide an environment in which programs can be developed using iconic flowcharts. Basic programming concepts such as assignments, conditions, loops, inputs and outputs are supported. Automatic code generation, debugging and program execution is also supported by the system. This paper reports on the development of B#, focusing on insig- - hts that were obtained concerning iconic programming tools. The use of B# by novice programmers in an introductory programming course is discussed and assessed. Recommendations are made as to how an iconic programming environment like B# could contribute to the successful completion of an introductory programming course","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0406-1; POD:1-4244-0405-3","10.1109/ITHET.2006.339788","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141651","Flowcharts;Iconic programming;Introductory programming","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer languages;Education;Educational programs;Educational technology;Flowcharts;Problem-solving;Programming environments;Programming profession;User interfaces","computational linguistics;computer aided instruction;computer science education;flowcharting;program compilers;program debugging;programming environments;teaching;visual programming","B# iconic programming tool;algorithmic thinking;automatic code generation;iconic flowchart;introductory programming courses;problem solving analysis;program debugging;program execution;programming language syntax;teaching;visual programming","","2","","20","","","","10-13 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It defines the purpose of the honeypot, the basic component of a honeynet, as ""an information system resource whose value lies in unauthorized or illicit use of that resource"". The objective of a honeynet is to attract malicious attackers, study their offensive strategy, and track every movement they make. The honeynet becomes a useful tool as one analyzes the data gathered from it to build new security into their system. Including a honeynet project in a Brigham Young University IT security curriculum provides hands-on experience with the dynamic Internet and all of the security components that go into securing a network. A VMware environment was used to create a virtual honeynet (Virtual) and compare its effectiveness to a network of physical computers (Real). This allowed students to learn the strengths and weaknesses of both Real and Virtual systems, and better prepare them to work with both. The areas in which Virtual and Real were compared are setup, deployment, maintenance, data collection, and data analysis. Virtual required only one computer whereas Real required one for each honeynet function. Setup was the area of greatest difference as Virtual dealt with virtual components whereas Real involved physical components. The issue of not being able to disguise a virtual network to appear ""real"" is the major concern as a honeynet is only as effective as it appears to be a real, functioning network. Likewise, it is only as good as the data it collects. Maintenance of the networks is where Virtual gained the advantage over Real. One must constantly rebuild the honeypots as they get attacked and trashed. This returning to a base build is much more efficient in the Virtual realm. Gaining experience with a Virtual honeynet, also, was found to be most effective to train teams to more efficiently implement a Rea- l honeynet","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0406-1; POD:1-4244-0405-3","10.1109/ITHET.2006.339685","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141694","Attack Data Analysis;Honey Net;Honey Pot;Honey Wall;Maintenance;Security Curriculum;Virtualization","Computer networks;Computer security;Data analysis;Data security;Education;IP networks;Information systems;Internet;Physics computing;Tracking","computer aided instruction;computer science education;security of data;teaching","Honeynet Project;IT security curriculum;Internet community;VMware environment;attack data analysis;computer security;honey wall;honeypot;information system resource;malicious attackers;network security;teaching resource;virtual honey net","","5","","2","","","","10-13 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The University of Wollongong has recently implemented a new learner management system however this technology ramp-up has been accompanied by a two year process of interviews and consultation with committees, deans, managers, academics, students and support staff to: 1) more clearly articulate from the educational and strategic perspectives why we use eLearning; 2) understand better how eLearning should be supported in a blended environment; and 3) inform decision-making about priorities for funding and support. This has resulted in a strategic plan for eLearning and eTeaching as well as an eTeaching business plan. The business plan contains 22 actions to accompany the implementation of the learner management system. In this paper, using a revision of the MIT90s framework for IT strategic planning, the 22 actions are categorized by the framework's five key factors: a) strategy, b) structure, c) management processes, d) roles and skills, and e) technology. The revised MIT90s framework proposes that it is never a matter of merely implementing technology, nor a matter of merely stating in a Strategic Plan that technology is important; all five factors must be addressed. This analysis of the University of Wollongong's 22 actions demonstrates that whilst setting the strategy and structure is essential, the majority of actions are in the two areas of management processes, and roles and skills. Although a number of the actions are only relevant to the University of Wollongong context, the paper outlines several actions that may be generalized to other universities","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0406-1; POD:1-4244-0405-3","10.1109/ITHET.2006.339686","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141695","Blended Learning;Planning Frameworks;Strategic Planning;e-Learning","Australia;Councils;Education;Educational institutions;Educational technology;Electronic learning;Environmental management;Multimedia systems;Strategic planning;Technology management","computer aided instruction;educational administrative data processing;strategic planning;teaching","eLearning;eTeaching;learner management system;strategic planning","","1","","13","","","","10-13 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Computer aided training systems offer a flexible and cost-effective method for learning new skills. The satisfactory management of risk situations involves risk identification, the development of risk handling strategies and plans and the conduct and monitoring of those plans. Recognising the importance of tacit knowledge, scenario-based training has gained importance in recent years. For example, USA General Accounting Office (GAO) released a report on Homeland security titled Risk Management approach can guide preparedness efforts. This report provides a list of risk assessment measurements for contingency plan development and a matrix for risk-based scenario development. In this paper, integrating traditional scenario-based training with desktop VR systems using game engineering, we investigate how a virtual reality training system, which draws on research in the areas of computer games, knowledge acquisition, agent technology and natural language processing, can provide a safe learning experience to assist acquisition of the necessary tacit knowledge. The aim of RiskMan is to train police officers to handle high-risk situations. RiskMan is an ARC Discovery project carried out by the Department of Computing in Macquarie University. RiskMan has been developed using a very-high level scripting language of a game engine, Unreal Tournament 2004. It is composed of modules such as a Scenario-based Expert System, a Narrative Engine, a Game Engine, and a CAD package.

Research is currently lacking indicators as to what will be the achievements, advantages, and disadvantages of operating cyber education. Therefore, this paper outlines the objectives of such research. First, this paper discusses the concept and features of cyber education by conducting a preliminary study and reviews its differences with conventional, face-to-face education. Indicators for measuring the efficiency of cyber education and satisfaction of students as the education target are then constructed. Finally, through empirical analysis by measuring the quality level and satisfaction of students taking cyber education, areas for improvement are identified. Cyber education has been considered an independent educational system following countless efforts toward the facilitation of cyber education; still, students are highly dissatisfied when it comes to some factors. In particular, seeking simultaneous interaction with students is known to be important; as in conventional, face-to-face education, both the educational content and professor's competency influence student satisfaction. Furthermore, the excessive control of classes makes encouraging student motivation currently difficult in cyber education","2159-5100;21595100","POD:1-890843-14-8","10.1109/PICMET.2006.296705","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4077527","","Appropriate technology;Area measurement;Computer science education;Costs;Educational programs;Educational technology;Information technology;Internet;Space technology;Time factors","educational technology","conventional education;cyber education;empirical analysis;face-to-face education;information-oriented education;quality level;society;student motivation;student satisfaction","","2","","31","","","","8-13 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The user should be able to access information from e-learning documents in a user friendly way, that is by questioning the system in their native language Hindi and the system returns the intended answer (also in Hindi) by searching in context from the repository of Hindi documents. The language constructs, query structure, common words, etc. are completely different in Hindi as compared to English. A novel strategy, in addition to conventional search and NLP techniques, was used to construct the Hindi QA system. The focus is on context based retrieval of information. For this purpose we implemented a Hindi search engine that works on locality-based similarity heuristics to retrieve relevant passages from the collection. It also incorporates language analysis modules like stemmer and morphological analyzer as well as self constructed lexical database of synonyms.

Research in the area of role-based access control (RBAC) has made fast progress over the last ten years and is well-known to effective techniques to reduce the complexity of role administration and ensure the security policy in large institutions or enterprises. However, we came to faced with two questions in adopting RBAC; how controls the access right of huge users in real world and how restricts the personal data access range of each user who takes the same role in organization. In RBAC model, the accessible data range is defined by role and its' system operation and it is needed to be extend it's model. In this paper we proposed new role and data based access control (RDBAC) platform, which was extended data access control mechanism and deployed in NEIS (National Education Information System). NEIS is a Web based centralized education administration system. It was developed as one of the 11 e-government projects by Ministry of Education and Human Resource Development (MOE&HRD) in Korea.

As context, this paper summarizes the nature of the problem, current Department of Defense (DoD) guidance on the issue, and current DoD methods to capture commercial IT. Subsequently, the paper identifies and discusses the major obstacles that impede DoD's use of commercial IT: non-attractiveness; non-transparency; non-agility; non-dominance; an isolating market; and attitudes of primes. In order to ameliorate these obstacles, a balanced mix of initiatives is recommended: 1) Enhance communications/organization (e.g., create a new organization at JFCOM to coordinate DoD's use of commercial IT); 2) Increase resource flexibility(e.g., provide combatant commands appropriate limited acquisition authority); 3) Decrease barriers (e.g., change DoD rules on intellectual property rights); 4) Stimulate cultural change(e.g., increase DoD education and training for commercial IT procurement); 5) Review testing (e.g., evaluate expanding ""underwriter lab "" testbeds); 6) Adapt requirements for specific missions(e.g.,undertake studies on the use of commercial IT in stabilization and reconstruction operations).","","POD:0-7695-2515-6","10.1109/ICCBSS.2006.5","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1595755","","Cultural differences;Defense industry;Global communication;Impedance;Information technology;Intellectual property;National security;Procurement;Technological innovation;Testing","military computing;public administration","Department of Defense system;IT innovation;commercial information technology;cultural change;intellectual property right;limited acquisition authority;military strategy;resource flexibility","","0","","15","","","","13-16 Feb. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In one experimental condition, groups could see the positions of each member; while in the other location-awareness was not provided. All users could use the tablet PC to communicate through annotations. We found no differences between the two conditions with regard to the task performance. Neither were there any differences in terms of cognitive workload. However, players without the location-awareness indications had a better representation of their partners' paths.

In the final stages of the course, 3D modelling of different heritage sites was integrated as a design study medium. We compared two cohorts from two academic years, following the above module. Qualitative results suggest that the integration of 3D environments in a conventional academic course can be engaging and beneficial in improving learning capabilities. Throughout this study, the respective curricula and views expressed by lecturers and students served as test bed to assess whether this paradigm has good potential to be used to create novel resources for different undergraduate curriculum.

Gerhardt","","2005 6th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training","20051219","2005","","","F1A/1","F1A/2","The paper first presents the basic premise and rationale covering distance learning development. It shows that with the emergence of distributed learning technologies, universities have increased access to markets outside of their normal geographic region through distance learning. Also, as new technologies emerge, they impact the way in courses are delivered to remote audiences. As technology evolves, it continues to be a great enabler of education, and universities should have deliberate strategies for selecting and employing technology in support of distributed education. The paper then addresses the three generations of distributed learning technology, and their impact on the development of both the process and product. The first generation was broadcast technologies for distribution of learning beyond the campus with very little change in the instructional model. The second generation used interactive television and the initial use of the Internet to support education (Web sites, electronic course materials, etc.), but still saw very little change in the instructional model. The third generation uses Internet technologies that enable two-way communication and collaboration for increased interaction between students and more of a virtual learning community (online conferencing, chat rooms, etc.), and forces changes in the instructional model. In the fourth generation, the paper peeks into the future utilization of the newest technologies for distance learning, such as PDAs, wireless devices, iPods, etc., to provide innovative learning experiences for students that further revolutionize the way in which instruction is provided. In each of these, the authors take advantage of their extensive Rensselaer experience, as well as more broadly discuss the global implications of; the role distance learning plays in the university relative to its vision and mission; the way in which technologies for distance learning are selected and deployed; the impact technology has on the design and delivery of courses via distance; the need for faculty development and support in integrating technology into their course delivery and the organizational and budgetary models for supporting technology for distributed learning.","","POD:0-7803-9141-1","10.1109/ITHET.2005.1560265","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1560265","Distance learning","Broadcast technology;Computer aided instruction;Continuing education;Educational institutions;Educational products;Educational technology;Internet;Online Communities/Technical Collaboration;Paper technology;TV","Internet;distance learning;educational technology","Internet;broadcast technology;distance learning;distributed learning;electronic course materials;innovative learning;interactive television;virtual learning community","","0","","","","","","7-9 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then a micro-GA is presented and subsequently introduced its parallel implementation with coarse grain. The so-called micro-GA is a GA with micro-population scheme. Taking advantage of the merit of multi-population, population size can be cut down appropriately by means of inter-population crossover. Because of the inter-population operator, the individuals' diversity will not turn worse due to the shrunken population size. The parallel strategy comprises a mapping of one (or a few) population(s) onto each processor of MIMD multiprocessing system. Both the micro and parallel approach can speed up the whole genetic evolutionary procedure.

In this paper, we present our study of a course website design project in a public high school to investigate new teaching strategies in technology education. We observed how students and teachers shifted roles during the project, i.e., students became technology consultants and trainers while teachers, although still acting as facilitators of the process, also became learners.

The search using metadata guarantees more fitting results for user??s various queries and can return the results based on resources. Therefore, the metadata will play an important role in the future and the standard model for representing metadata like RDF is needed. RDF is written as a XML serialization using XML-based syntax. The existing XML documents also can be converted to RDF document with some modification. Designing XML to be in the RDF format has numerous benefits. So, the representation of data using the RDF format is activated for the next generation of Web. In this paper, we propose the strategy for the transition from existing XML documents into RDF.

In client-server applications, this adaptability is very important to enhance the reliability of the system and maintain the consistency of the objects. We describe a framework that can detect the changes in performance of the execution environment, and provide strategies in order to adapt such changes. Using these access strategies the client objects can access the server objects efficiently in a dynamically changing environment. We do not only consider the dynamic changes of the network characteristics but also consider the end-hosts performances before changing to the optimal strategy. Therefore the client objects can achieve the maximum usefulness of the environment. Here, we introduce three access strategies, namely client migration, direct access, and lazy access to impart an adaptive behavior to the client objects in the distributed environment. Advancing from the conventional static access models we propose algorithms to select the best-suited access strategy for the dynamic environment. Moreover the proposed model is to be implemented to the ""juice"" distributed object-oriented environment.","","POD:0-7695-2051-0","10.1109/AINA.2004.1283834","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1283834","","Artificial intelligence;Bandwidth;Biomedical informatics;Computer networks;Distributed computing;Educational technology;IP networks;Maintenance;Network servers;Object oriented modeling","client-server systems;object-oriented methods;open systems","adaptable access strategy;client migration;client-server application;direct access;distributed object-oriented environment;end-host performance;lazy access;network characteristics;open distributed environment;static access model","","1","","9","","","","29-31 March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This concentration has evolved only lately when people began to realize the importance of scalability and tailorability as opposed to generic strategies and approaches in software development. Modest efforts were there to build primitive taxonomies and frameworks. However, these efforts established a roadmap for forthcoming research. Yet, specialized system development is not only new and broad but also critical for the success of today's businesses and software developers alike. Generic approaches are considered weak strategies unless they are tailored to specific needs in terms of application scope, application nature or the certain requirements of industries or organizations .This requires extensive focus on the application domain of software systems. The rationale for this is the diversity of needs across system stakeholders, levels and types of business problems and resources that make the concept of one -size-fits-all almost obsolete. Some sub-generic super-specific areas can bridge the gap between common software development and specialized development since these areas are global to many industries but have strong focus on a specific application domain.","","POD:0-7803-7724-9","10.1109/ITRE.2003.1270587","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1270587","","Application software;Bridges;Glass;Problem-solving;Programming;Scalability;Software engineering;Software systems;Standardization;Taxonomy","software engineering;systems analysis","business problems;software development;specialized system development;system stakeholder","","0","","6","","","","11-13 Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes a methodological approach that enables practitioners to use the IB model to identify potential areas of value creation. It presents a pragmatic way of employing the IB model for the HIV information system and discusses possible ways to conceptualize, operationalize, and ultimately measure value creation in collaborative environments, such as those encountered in worldwide networked research environments. Technical and human aspects are inseparable factors for value creation in organizations. The technological aspects include the application of technology as well as organization concepts such as strategy. Human aspects include collaboration and the collaborative interplay between humans employing technology. With the IB model it is possible to emphasize the importance of both dimensions. This model makes pragmatic data analysis possible without requiring practitioners to deal with complicated statistical analyses.

Packaging related aspects are mainly covered by the technological design and electronic circuit's courses. The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence of such Electronic Packaging information in our curricula during the past ten years. The curricula restructuring process relies on the continuous adaptation and updating of the delivered teaching activities in order to compensate the main drawbacks of the last years: the student's change of professional interest from hardware design to software design and the technological gap between our current equipment endowment and the current level of technology worldwide required. Thus, the process of upgrading the equipment involved promoting actions for the IT features and benefits in design and teaching processes. The paper presents the main strategy to include IT features in Electronic Packaging teaching process. The strategy covers a large domain: from modern CAD tools to Internet access to relevant and useful information and even by creating new virtual platforms for Electronic Packaging lab sessions (e.g. using Matlab).

Often the student would like to search this material for topics over single lectures, entire courses, sets of multiple courses, multiple instructors, or a combination thereof. Since the goal of Infusion is to relieve the instructor of such time-consuming tasks as inserting hand edited meta-tags and time indices, an automated solution is desired.

Consequently, an instructor can use the information to refine his/her teaching strategies in the classroom or virtual classroom. We propose a statistical model of word usage, which originates from information retrieval technology, to group learners' discussion messages by concept similarity into time dependent topics.

The ICT industry for instance has an enormous potential for making the world more sustainable by using their technological know how to reduce environmental burdens, fostering education and participation through applications of advanced technological products. However, the current development of electronics and information and communication technology reflects no considerations of ethical or sustainability values. This paper presents one example on how technological development and product manufacturing might be changed in the near future due to the growing recognition of sustainable development within the ICT industry. Taking the mobile communication industry, with its network provider, system technology and handheld device manufacturer, expanding markets and global supply chains, as an example, it is discussed how this branch might change their technological development and management praxis to more sustainability in a sense of a global value that focus on a well balanced ecological, economical and social development as well as equal opportunities for present and future generations. It is briefly discussed what sustainability means in the context of mobile communication technology. Then a close look is taken at the growing sustainability initiatives in the field of mobile communication and the 3G Greenbook Initiative of T-Mobile Germany in particular. With regards to environmentally benign and sustainable technology development and production socio-ethical standards for procurement and supply chain management are an important issue within the 3G Greenbook. As more and more companies are implementing environmental management systems, e.g. EAMS or ISO 14001, starting environmental and sustainability reporting, e.g. Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), green procurement requirements are flourishing.","1095-2020;10952020","POD:0-7803-7743-5","10.1109/ISEE.2003.1208042","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208042","","3G mobile communication;Communications technology;Consumer electronics;Educational products;Educational technology;Environmental economics;Manufacturing industries;Procurement;Pulp manufacturing;Supply chain management","3G mobile communication;design for environment;sustainable development","3G Greenbook Initiative;Global Reporting Initiative;ICT industry;T-Mobile;communication technology;education;environmental burdens reduction;environmental management systems;environmentally benign technology;equal opportunities;global supply chains;green procurement requirements;handheld device manufacturer;information;life cycle engineering integration;management;mobile communication industry;product manufacturing;sustainable development;technological development;technological developments","","0","","6","","","","19-22 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the long term, the project also aims at developing a strong regional competency kernel through the use of technology as a tool to encourage the development, documentation and use of indigenous information and knowledge about tropical islands environment: evaluate what is available, how it can be preserved, strengthened, amplified or improved through the introduction of ICT and how it could participate, in the basket of globalisation, as our share for a common identity. The authors show how enhancement and dissemination of research results can be achieved by a combination of an upstream strategy based on IKBS, a generic software for building knowledge bases on the Internet in natural sciences, and a downstream one, based on a pedagogical approach borrowed from the DARWIN world.

Discussion and exchange of ideas enable learners to learn together. However, the granularity of the Web-based learning context is extensive; consequently, e-courseware design faces new dilemmas. Only through targeted research will it be known with any certainty whether Web-based learning gives rise to a new type of learning dissonance. It has been proposed that converged theoretical paradigms that underpin particular digitised or context-mediated learning systems are forcing learners into new ways of thinking. This paper presents an overview of the plans for an experimental project designed to understand the ontological requirements for experiential instructional environments.

At the moment, there are more than 1 million EduCitizens registered in EduCities. 2,000 schools (more than half of schools in Taiwan) have built their EduTowns (smaller version of EduCities) and 18,000 classes are running their EduVillages. But these figures only represent an infrastructure, a bare skeleton, of a future network learning society. Based on the authors' work on EduCities, they argue that a network learning society will not be a 'tribal' learning society or a learning ecology, as portrayed by John Seely Brown in his keynote at ICCE98. Instead, it will be a 'structured' learning society. This structure mimics the current real world society we are used to today. The essence of the power of network is connectivity - connecting people, physical objects, information repositories, almost everything in the world. The question is how we use this network capability to link the old social structure, and from that, cultivate and diffuse learning elements into this structure, and expand the structure to form a larger but connected learning society. These strategies and actions taken are what we call the social design of a network learning society. If network learning is a learning ecology, then it must evolve around an existing structure.","","POD:0-7695-1509-6","10.1109/CIE.2002.1185850","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1185850","","Cities and towns;Computer science education;Continuing education;Educational institutions;Educational programs;Educational technology;Environmental factors;Joining processes;Power system modeling;Skeleton","Internet;computer aided instruction;distance learning;social aspects of automation;teaching","EduCities;Taiwan;connectivity;learning ecology;network city;network learning society;social design;structured learning society","","1","","4","","","","3-6 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, most theoretical findings are obtained by using students as subjects. We are interested in knowing the practicability of groupware embedded in a professional community of practice. To gain insights into the reality of knowledge sharing and creation through collaborative technologies in a real setting, we recruited teachers from a teachers' professional cyber community to form special interest groups and conducted three phases of on-job training projects using the grounded action research approach. Teachers from primary and junior high schools were mediated by groupware technology and learned to design lesson plans collaboratively. Various data sources such as system logs, group memories, interviews, and questionnaires were also collected. Through these three phases, we identify several types of processes of team-based knowledge sharing and creation in the professional cyber community, defined by the causal conditions, action/interaction strategies, and consequences. Some phenomena identified through these three phases are elaborated in this study.","","POD:0-7695-1874-5","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1173750","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1173750","","Bridges;Collaboration;Collaborative software;Collaborative tools;Collaborative work;Education;Educational institutions;Information management;Information technology;Recruitment","educational computing;groupware;knowledge management;professional communication;team working","action research;action-interaction strategies;data sources;groupware;interest groups;on-job training projects;professional cyber community;system logs;team collaboration;team-based knowledge creation;team-based knowledge sharing","","0","","31","","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, rare research focused on improving students' web learning performance according to their needs, learning behaviors' records, and personal characteristics. The purpose of the research was to construct the web-based learning environment based on students' needs and develop suitable teaching strategies for each individual. In the research, the concept of customer relationship management (CRM) was applied to provide a satisfied learning experience. Kano's (1984) evaluation table for classifying the students' needs into three types (must-be, one-dimensional, and attractive) was first applied to conduct functional or dysfunctional form of questions on students of a Cyber University in southern Taiwan. Then, according to students' needs, learning behaviors' records, and personal characteristics, teaching strategy reasoning was utilized to select more suitable materials for each student.

In order to assist the children to express themselves more fluently in writing, especially the writing of argumentative texts, the class uses synchronous test-based computer mediated communication to debate topics of interest. Computer generated logs of the debate have been analysed to determine the types, of strategy used by the teachers both to facilitate the discussion and to manage the class within the computer-mediated context. The responses of the children are also examined in order to determine the effectiveness of different types of strategy.

The images were made available to middle school students and teachers across the country and overseas through the World Wide Web. The KidSat Project was one of the first NASA programs to attempt to use the web as a means of distributing image data within minutes of the time they were captured in space. After the first hurdle, getting the image data online in a timely manner, was cleared, it became the goal of the data system to present that data in an understandable context. The development of the system was a collaborative effort. Members of the data system team conferred continually with teachers, students, and other members of the KidSat Project. Modifications to the data system were made as often as was possible, while attempting to avoid confusing the users. The goal was to create an online system that presented the KidSat images in a manner that allowed the students to better understand and interpret these images. In short, that goal was reached, but whether the users agreed with this judgment may be directly related to the speed with which they could connect to the Internet. Many lessons were learned along the way, and strategies for future similar projects were devised. For the three KidSat missions, over 1500 images were captured and made available on the data system. Additionally, metadata describing the shuttle location and orientation, satellite weather data (captured at or near the time of the KidSat image), and digital maps of the area directly surrounding the KidSat image were made available.

Part 1 of the program is devoted to general matters. In it, the student is presented with situations which are accompanied by the question `How would you handle this?'. This is followed by a learning style test (Kolb, 1984). The student's preferred approach or learning style is determined on the basis of the outcome of Part 1. This preference forms the input to Part 2 of the program, which is devoted to Business Economics. Assistance offered in this part of the program is tailored to the learning style the student uses to solve Business Economics problems.

This work fits in the paradigm in which computers are used as cognitive tools to help learners recognize, judge and organize patterns of information. We adopt the concept of epistemic games and forms as discussed in Collins and Ferguson (1993). Epistemic games act as structured concept maps that help organize information. EPIGAME teaches epistemic games in the context of discussing some domain of interest. Faced with a task for organizing or creating knowledge, the learner is first presented with the epistemic form and then guided to fill in the epistemic form in order to organize or create knowledge. Her moves will be constrained by the rules of the game. In this paper, we propose and discuss the design of EPIGAME.

The author spent 18 months working with her engineering colleagues to develop strategies to enhance the incorporation of instructional technology in engineering classes. She concluded that (1) faculty development activities should first address the pedagogy, not the technology, (2) faculty peers must be involved in introducing instructional technology into an institution, and (3) the increase in technology use was directly related to the number of strategies in which the faculty participated.

The legislation required a change in approach and procedure. In particular the new regulations emphasised both the duties and responsibilities of directors and those of all employees throughout the organisation. This tacit acknowledgement of the need to institutionalise or integrate health and safety considerations in all aspects of organisational life has made it inappropriate to charge single individuals such as safety officers with overall responsibility for safety within a company or division. Rather, the regulations have stated clearly that while employers are required to provide education and training regarding Display Screen Equipment (DSE) work and recommended practice to their employees, there is a reciprocal legal obligation for the employees to apply this expertise in the conduct of their work. The content of the regulations therefore has implications for induction, for Information Technology training, for performance assessment criteria, for reward systems, and for job design.

Two major efforts, the Portal to the Future Workshop and the Geoscience Digital Library (GDL) project, have established a vision for the library, a governance process to enable community ownership, management, and construction, and have begun development of a testbed collection, discovery system, and user interface. The DLESE Community Plan lays out in detail the need for this facility, a community vision for its goals and priorities, and a strategy for initial construction of the library. From this initial work, two conclusions emerge as paramount in moving forward with the library. First, it is essential that development of the library community and the building of the technological infrastructure for the library go hand in hand. Second, the library will be most effectively built as a highly coordinated, but distributed community effort. In this way, the full range of talents in the community can be leveraged and rapid development of the library is possible. This paper briefly reviews our technical accomplishments to date and outlines their plans for further development. Progress and plans can be charted in the following three areas: 1.

The increasing recognition that sophisticated management of knowledge is essential to maintaining competitive advantage suggests the importance for firm investment in strategic management development. This paper presents the argument that management development must be results oriented and closely linked to business goals such as competitiveness, disseminating common culture, and driving change. As a result, management development has become a force for not only improving the skills and knowledge but for overall organizational development. This paper discusses the role of management development programs in fulfilling the following criteria: improving management skills of technical managers; encouraging the technical managers from different disciplines to work together cross-nationally to share product and market information; helping firms define the role of the general manager in developing clear business objectives and performance measures in line with their missions and vision; and providing a mechanism for effective management networking and enhancement of professional interpersonal relationships. The discussion includes a review of the trends in management development, the links between management development and strategy, and role of managerial skills in gaining a sustained competitive advantage.

Negative consequences for the talent pool available for the future workforce and equal opportunity. Mentoring has been lauded as a strategy to improve retention of women students in engineering and related fields. Electronic communications now can support a cost-effective opportunity for mentoring which transcends previous constraints to extensive mentoring programs-time, synchronous communication, and geography. In early 1998, WEPAN, the Women in Engineering Programs and Advocates Network, launched ""MentorNet"", a national electronic industrial mentoring program. MentorNet pairs undergraduate and graduate women studying engineering and related sciences with volunteers in industry in a year-long structured mentoring relationship conducted via e-mail. MentorNet offers online applications, matching, training, and ongoing coaching for participants, and evaluation. In its pilot semester in early 1998, MentorNet paired 204 student from 15 universities with mentors in industry. In 1998-99, 539 students from 26 universities were matched with mentors.

Two models tend to dominate current offerings-an expensive audio/video real time interaction place dependent model and an inexpensive Internet based delayed interaction place independent model. By combining the most favorable elements of these models with technology prevalent in the MOO/MUD culture, a new MDU model was developed and field tested. This was a text based inexpensive distance learning model that offered real time interaction and place independent accessibility. The key element of this MDU or virtual learning environment (VLE) model was Diversity University-an experimental object oriented virtual reality college that enables same time different place text based interaction over the Internet. During the Spring 1995 semester, it served as a platform for conducting an entire information systems (IS) seminar style graduate capping course field study. A comparative analysis was done between the VLE course and the PLE (physical learning environment) courses. The replicatable strategy and results of this successful field study are presented.

Easy equation sets have one unknown variable in each equation such that the equations can be solved sequentially. Hard equation sets have one critical unknown located in many (or all) of the equations in the set such that many (or all) of the equations must be solved simultaneously. We call these equations ""coupled"" and we teach students how they can analyze equation sets (based on the location of known and unknown variables) to ""decouple"" the equations and make the solution path easy. We describe the algorithm called the DeCoupler, which is used to identify variable interactions to determine the optimal decoupling variables. We also describe the SmartSwapper algorithm, which uses information from the DeCoupler to simplify the solution path and parametrically iterate to a solution. The algorithms are logic based rather than numerically focused. The algorithms have been implemented into an equation solving software program (SmartSolve2) to demonstrate their effectiveness compared to other commercial strategies. It has been shown that these algorithms can solve nonlinear simultaneous equations without the need for highly refined initial guesses. By teaching the concepts of these algorithms, students are assisted in becoming more effective problem solvers.","0190-5848;01905848","POD:0-7803-5643-8","10.1109/FIE.1999.839271","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839271","","Algorithm design and analysis;Convergence of numerical methods;Logic;Nonlinear equations;Optimized production technology;Systems engineering and theory","computer aided instruction;mathematics computing;nonlinear equations","DeCoupler algorithm;SmartSolve2;SmartSwapper algorithm;coupled equations;easy equation sets;equation solving software program;hard equation sets;nonlinear equation systems solution;nonlinear simultaneous equations;optimal decoupling variables;problem solvers;simulation","","0","","7","","","","10-13 Nov. 1999","10 Nov 1999-13 Nov 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper starts off addressing the integration of the field devices into the plant information and control system, facilitating the effective use of their capabilities. To achieve this goal it is also necessary to consider the digital information infrastructure at the field level, known as the fieldbus. The various options available are covered, concentrating on important factors which should be taken into account before applying these emerging technologies and keeping in mind the ISA and IEC standards. These factors are, amongst others: the migration of intelligence to field devices, the execution of control strategies in the field, intrinsic safety, performance, security, physical installation, maintenance, plant availability, openness, interoperability, process monitoring and diagnostics, installation and operation costs","1091-5281;10915281","POD:0-7803-4797-8","10.1109/IMTC.1998.679779","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=679779","","Africa;Control systems;Digital communication;Educational institutions;Field buses;IEC standards;Instruction sets;Instruments;Microprocessors;Safety devices","computer networks;computerised control;computerised instrumentation;control engineering education;digital communication;educational computing;educational courses;field buses","Eduardo Mondlane;Mozambique;South Africa;control system;diagnostic information;diagnostics;digital communication systems;digital information infrastructure;educational environment;emerging technologies;fieldbus;installation;intelligence;intelligent instrumentation;intelligent microprocessors;interoperability;intrinsic safety;maintenance;openness;operation costs;performance;physical installation;plant availability;process monitoring;security;tertiary institutions","","0","","16","","","","18-21 May 1998","18 May 1998-21 May 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, enormous challenges are facing today's educational institutions, to reduce costs, improve access, and cater to a changing population more interested in lifelong learning using distance education. This societal change promises to have a profound impact on the traditional university system. Schools have responded by spawning a variety of methods and technologies for delivering distance education. This is in turn transforming how knowledge is delivered to students. Not only does the instructor need to learn how to use the new technologies, the nature and style of delivery of the course content itself has to be adapted to the new medium of delivery. It has become axiomatic that teamwork and cooperative learning are essential ingredients in engineering and engineering technology education. Cooperative learning becomes a challenge in a commuter school where the students are widely dispersed throughout the community and many of whom have significant out-of-school commitments including work and families.

ESS marshals the resources a variety of scientific and technical fields to explore interactions among the Earth's component subsystems in order to understand the Earth as a system, to explain Earth dynamics and Earth evolution, and to address the problem of the affects of human actions on global change. In order to investigate the Earth system, teachers and students need access to expertise in a broad variety of disciplines: chemistry, physics, computer science, biology, mathematics, statistics, and political science. A variety of relatively new skills are also required: networked computing, tools and techniques for retrieving, visualizing, and analyzing remote sensing data, and building dynamic systems models. The question of visualization of remote sensing data became a central issue in curriculum development efforts of the Earth System Science Community (ESSC), a three-year project supported by NASA's Information Infrastructure Technology and Applications and High Performance Computing and Communication programs. The thrust of the curriculum development effort was to enable students and teachers to conduct investigations in global change topics using remote sensing data gathered by NASA and other science agencies. The curriculum was project-based, with the intention of producing an authentic and living sense of understanding and participation in science research. Students and teachers were to collaborate online with their peers in other schools, and with scientists/mentors in universities and government science agencies. In this effort students and teachers become researchers and learn to design and carry out a research strategy, involving the proposal and articulation of a hypothesis, the building of a system model, and the search, retrieval, manipulation, visualization and analysis of appropriate data. Students conclude their research by testing their hypothesis with available data, using visualization software, and information available in print and on-line.

A graph called the classified typed task graph is used to describe the current status of tasks of different types at each scheduling step. With the graph, the algorithm dynamically evaluates the priorities of tasks only when there are multiply executable candidates, and then schedules an appropriate one onto the currently available processors of the corresponding type.

The lectures exploit the i-book, transforming the classroom into an interactive teaching laboratory. An electronic white board is used in every lecture to teach from the text and run the simulations. Our goal is to teach adaptive systems to undergraduate electrical engineering students. Undergraduates do not have the mathematical background to comprehend the equation-based approach utilized in graduate-level adaptive systems courses. We have used the i-book for undergraduate instruction with very positive results. We are now ready to extend the format for distance learning.

Since the students of today will be the employees of tomorrow, we should be keenly interested in how the educational experience will affect the styles of management that will have to be employed for organization to achieve peak performance. The current teaching and learning styles most likely to affect organizational values and expectations are direct access and remote learning, integrated curriculum, and collaborative learning process. In the past, the impact of this early programming was minimized until the workers had reached a policy-making level within the organization. Due to an expected shortage of qualified workers, it will be necessary for management to build an organization that meets the expectations of the next generation of workers. The shortage of qualified workers will also necessitate that management develop strategies to employ some of the unqualified workers. In-house training programs and job design are two strategies future management will probably have to employ to meet the demand for labor. Regardless of the strategies employed, the value of the skilled workers will increase. To retain those valuable resources, management must be willing to create an environment that meets the expectations of the new workforce, invest in skills training and education, and allow some degree of autonomy in selection of assignments. In the future, even more than now, managers will have to serve as mentors, establish a learning environment, facilitate peer-to-peer learning, and share information acquired through experience","","POD:0-7803-3574-0","10.1109/PICMET.1997.653362","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=653362","","Collaborative work;Education;Educational programs;Environmental management;Humans;Job design;Management training;Marine animals;Programming profession;Waste management","management education;personnel;teaching","collaborative learning process;direct access;educational methodology;in-house training programs;information sharing;integrated curriculum;job design;learning environment;learning styles;management styles;organizational values;peer-to-peer learning;policy-making level;qualified workers;remote learning;teaching;unqualified workers","","0","","","","","","27-31 Jul 1997","27 Jul 1997-31 Jul 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes how the change has been achieved through: a corporate teaching and learning strategy focused on student centred approaches; a conscious identification of flexible delivery and assessment through the use of computers; the need to define and deliver graduate attributes consistent with professional practice and accrediting bodies. The Information Technology Alignment Program (ITAP) and the Distributed Learning System (DLS) have been established to provide a standard university wide infrastructure and interface for program development and delivery. Changes of this magnitude and nature are not possible over a very short period.

The NSF Engineering Scholars Education Workshop addresses these concerns by helping participants make the transition from graduate student to professor. The week-long workshop is intended to provide new and future faculty members with the information they need to survive and flourish as academics. In terms of teaching and learning, there is a wealth of published material which new faculty members simply do not have time to read. Some of the more important and theoretical information, especially from the field of cognitive psychology, is not always readily applied to learning and teaching situations. Furthermore, becoming an effective teacher takes time and experience, and the trial and error process that one goes through is painful to both the students and the teacher.

Since many university budgets are shrinking, accountability is expected for all invested funds, including those used for recruitment and retention. To better allocate resources to recruitment and retention efforts, a pilot survey was first administered to engineering freshman at ASU in the fall of 1994. This survey was refined and continued for an additional four years. Evaluations of the surveys in the first few years revealed some surprises. In the first survey, the primary reasons for attending ASU for an engineering degree was similar for both women and men: a good engineering school, close to home, and good weather. Surprising results, obtained from early surveys, showed that over fifty percent of the junior college transfers only decided on engineering after they attended college. Contrary to expectations, the data also showed that for underrepresented minority engineering students, it made no difference if they took the Introduction to Engineering class in their first or second semester.

Univ., Miami, FL, USA","IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","20020806","1994","16","12","1212","1218","Describes a new feature-based stereo matching technique which exploits the Walsh transformation. The established matching strategy adopts and integrates the fundamental steps of the stereo vision problem: (a) detecting and locating feature points, (b) searching for potential matches, (c) validating a match through a global consistency check, and (d) determining the disparity of the matched feature points. The unique representation of stereo images into Walsh-based attributes unites the aforementioned steps into an integrated process which yields accurate disparity extraction.

ESS marshals the resources a variety of scientific and technical fields to explore interactions among the Earth's component subsystems in order to understand the Earth as a system, to explain Earth dynamics and evolution, and to address the problem of the effects of human actions on global change. In order to investigate the Earth system, teachers and students need access to expertise in a broad variety of disciplines: chemistry, physics, computer science, biology, mathematics, statistics, and political science. A variety of relatively new skills are also required: networked computing, tools and techniques for retrieving, visualizing, and analyzing remote sensing data, and building dynamic systems models. The question of systems modeling became a central issue in curriculum development efforts of the Earth System Science Community (ESSC), a three-year project supported by NASA's Information Infrastructure Technology and Applications and High Performance Computing and Communications programs. The thrust of the curriculum development effort was to enable students and teachers to conduct investigations in global change topics using remote sensing data gathered by NASA and other science agencies. The curriculum was project-based, with the intention of producing an authentic and living sense of understanding and participation in science research. Students and teachers were to collaborate on-line with their peers in other schools, and with scientists/mentors in universities and government science agencies. In this effort students and teachers become researchers and learn to design and carry out a research strategy, involving the proposal and articulation of a hypothesis, the building of a system model, and the search, retrieval, manipulation, visualization and analysis of appropriate data. Students conclude their research by testing their hypothesis with available data, using visualization software, and information available in print and on-line","","POD:0-7803-3836-7","10.1109/IGARSS.1997.615227","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=615227","","Curriculum development;Data analysis;Data visualization;Earth;Electronic switching systems;Evolution (biology);Geoscience;Information retrieval;Modeling;Remote sensing","climatology;education;geology;meteorology;oceanography;pollution;teaching;terrestrial atmosphere","Earth system science classroom;System thinking;atmosphere;climate;education;environmental science;geology;land surface;meteorology;ocean;pollution;sea;system modeling;systems analysis;teaching","","0","","16","","","","3-8 Aug 1997","03 Aug 1997-08 Aug 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

VRS lets the operator dictate directly into word processing software avoiding the need to use the keyboard for typing. Most applications type at least 70 wpm which is faster than the average typing speed. VRS has possibilities to alleviate some of the problems associated with the assimilation of information by tertiary students with SLD.

A multimodal user direction approach combining command and control methods is a very promising way to achieve this goal. This multimodal design is motivated by the idea of minimizing the user's burden of operating a robot manipulator while utilizing the user's intelligence and available mobilities. With this design, the user with a physical disability simply uses gesture (pointing with a laser pointer) to indicate a location or a desired object and uses speech to activate the system. Recognition of the spoken input is also used to supplant the need for general purpose object recognition between different objects and to perform the critical function of disambiguation. The robot system is designed to operate in an unstructured environment containing objects that are reasonably predictable. A novel reactive planning mechanism, of which the user is an active integral component, in conjunction with a stereo-vision system and an object-oriented knowledge base, provides the robot system with the 3D information of the surrounding world as well as the motion strategies","","POD:0-7803-3088-9","10.1109/SECON.1996.510021","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=510021","","Command and control systems;Intelligent robots;Laser theory;Man machine systems;Manipulators;Mobile robots;Object recognition;Optical design;Rehabilitation robotics;Speech","handicapped aids;image matching;manipulators;natural language interfaces;object-oriented databases;path planning;speech recognition;stereo image processing","3D information;command and control methods;disambiguation;gesture-speech based human-machine interface;motion strategies;multimodal design;object-oriented knowledge base;reactive planning mechanism;rehabilitation robot;robot manipulator;stereo-vision system;unstructured environment","","2","12","18","","","","11-14 Apr 1996","11 Apr 1996-14 Apr 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First a problem statement (text) is translated into a sketch (diagram) which visually articulates the essential problem parts. Mechanical models and free-body diagrams are instances of this first transformation. The qualitative model is then transformed into a set of mathematical formulae (symbols), which drive the problem solution. Thus, the problem is solved using three types of representational systems: textual, diagrammatic and symbolic. At each step the engineer translates information from one representational system to another, enacting an abstract cultural algorithm.

"Workshop — Developing active learning classroom exercises for use with Tablet PCs","J. G. Tront","Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech","2011 Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","20120202","2011","","","W1D-1","W1D-2","Tablet PCs use their inherent ability to accept electronic ink (e-ink) input to enable users to interact with the device in a more natural way. This is especially important in learning environments where the user needs to focus on subject material rather than on the device used to record or store the subject information. Using Tablet PCs, instructors are able to increase their effectiveness by making more dynamic presentations and by including active exercises into their classroom environments. Tablet PCs also facilitate better and more natural note-taking by students and easier after-class review of course material and notes. Further, Tablet PCs facilitate better interaction with persons participating in classroom sessions from remote locations since they easily involve students exchanging visual descriptions of concepts with the instructor and the rest of the class. Several software packages are available to support the pedagogical needs of the university classroom as well as typical group collaborative environments. Classroom Presenter, DyKnow, WriteOn and MS OneNote with the Interactive Classroom add-in are examples of some of the packages that provide excellent classroom capabilities. These packages allow for a highly interactive environment with both teacher-student and student-student bi-direction real-time interaction. See www.ee.vt.edu/∼jgtront/tabletpc/ to download tablet PC software. In this hands-on tutorial faculty will receive an introduction to the use of Classroom Presenter, OneNote, Interactive Classroom, VectorPad, and PDF Annotator. We will provide sufficient instruction for faculty to have a basic competency with the technology. Most importantly, we will show faculty various pedagogical practices that we have found helpful in using these technology tools in the classroom over the past seven years. Active learning exercises for various disciplines will be emphasized. Faculty will be tasked with developing short active learning exercises s- arting from the development of goals for the exercise, through the desired student interaction, and ending with the exercise assessment and improvement strategy. These active learning exercises will be targeted to students who are expected to be in the classroom as well as those who may be taking the course at extended campus locations. Exercises will be determined by the individual faculty member's disciplinary interests.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-61284-469-5; POD:978-1-61284-468-8; USB:978-1-61284-467-1","10.1109/FIE.2011.6143096","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6143096","Tablet PC;active learning;educational technology;electronic ink;electronic note-taking;slate computers;student engagement","","","","","0","","","","","","12-15 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In professional education, it is necessary to take into account value levels that are important for the development of personality individuality and social expression. We suggest a strategy for sustainability of interactivity in e-teaching technologies, applying the laws of axiological logic. Expert assessment of 26 e-teaching courses according to nine criteria is presented. It was established that e-teaching courses were best programmed with regard to realization of systemic approach to solving educational problem, quality of preparation of self-assessment tasks, logical structuring of the material and worse programmed in purposefulness and meaningfulness of the teaching media used in the course processes, value aspect of the course content (suitability and quality of interactivity realizing emotional (affective) educational goals, expressed in the form of affective educational goals), validity of methodology for holistic assessment of the acquired competencies.","1330-1012;13301012","CD-ROM:978-953-7138-13-4; POD:978-953-7138-12-7","10.1109/ITI.2008.4588460","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4588460","E-teaching;axiology of e-teaching products;emotional goals of professional education;epistemic and instrumental knowledge;interactivity","Agriculture;Distance learning;Education;Educational products;Globalization;Information technology;Instruments;Logic;Physiology;Psychology","distance learning;educational courses;expert systems;formal logic;teaching","axiological logic;e-teaching courses;e-teaching product interactivity;e-teaching technology;expert assessment;personality individuality;professional education;self-assessment tasks","","1","","16","","","","23-26 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
