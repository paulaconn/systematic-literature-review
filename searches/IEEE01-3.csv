This expansion of the use of cloud applications comes with some significant learning and adoption challenges to the end users along with the technical advantages that allow greater accessibility and ease of use. The influence of individual user perceptions toward these technologies is an issue that merits further investigation. Several technology acceptance models have demonstrated some degree of success in predicting adoption behaviors utilizing individual user traits and beliefs. However, there have been limited investigations of variables after the technology has been implemented and used. This paper focuses on the associations between variables identified in the literature that are considered to be influencing use and perceptions of technology for undergraduate students of technology at a mid-sized university in Southeast Michigan. The results statistically present significant correlations between each measured variable and support the interaction between perceived ease of use, computer anxiety, computer self-efficacy, and internet self-efficacy with the perceived usefulness of cloud applications in a higher education setting.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8297-7; POD:978-1-4673-8298-4","10.1109/CSE.2015.36","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371372","cloud computing;computer anxiety;effectiveness;higher education;self-efficacy","Biological system modeling;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Computers;Education;Information technology;Organizations","cloud computing;computer aided instruction;further education;statistical analysis","Internet self-efficacy;cloud computing effectiveness;computer anxiety;computer self-efficacy;higher education institution;perceived ease of use;statistical analysis;student perception","","1","","33","","","","21-23 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While ECS has been well-received by its students and successful in reaching many students of diverse backgrounds, it currently suffers from a final module which is expensive and offers no easy transition to text-based programming. This module, which teaches robotics as an application of computing, rests on the LEGO Mindstorms1 platform. The Mindstorms have a block-based programming language that abstracts too much code to be of any use for making a transition from block-based programming to text-based programming. They are also more expensive than most schools can afford. This paper reports on one aspect of our successful effort to create an alternative curriculum which meets the same curriculum objectives as the current sixth module, but for a reduced price.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8367-7; POD:978-1-4673-8368-4","10.1109/BLOCKS.2015.7369021","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7369021","Arduino;Computer Science;ECS;block-based programming;paper","Computer languages;Hardware;Keyboards;Programming profession;Visualization","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational institutions;embedded systems;object-oriented languages;object-oriented programming","ECS;LEGO Mindstorm;MUzECS;block-based programming language;embedded block;exploring computer science education;schools;text-based programming","","","","7","","","","22-22 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Apart from technical issues for u-learning, new questions can arise concerning what are desirable ways of u-learning. As a basic work in this direction, the vision and agendas of u-learning will be discussed in terms of two aspects: 1) building up better and higher level of learning environment supported by ubiquitous computing and 2) establishing a wholesome education community. Last but not least, key elements required for learners in u-learning era are proposed at the end of the presentation, which compose of six core capabilities: cognitive capability relational capability, emotional capability, adaptability, technology literacy and effective learning ability.","","Electronic:978-1-61284-406-0; POD:978-1-61284-407-7","10.1109/ICPAIR.2011.5976940","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5976940","","Buildings;Collaboration;Communities;Education;Pattern analysis;Robots;Ubiquitous computing","Internet;cognition;computer aided instruction;ubiquitous computing","UCT;Web 2.0;adaptability;cognitive capability;collaborative environment;educational issues;emotional capability;instructional activity;learning ability;learning environment;pervasive computing technology;relational capability;seamless computing technology;technology literacy;u-learning;ubiquitous computing technology;ubiquitous learning;ubiquitous society;wholesome education community","","0","","","","","","28-29 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our finding indicated that the experiences of teachers and students on using digital technologies is fair. However, there is only limited access to multimedia rich digital learning resources, and premature practice of integrating them into the curriculum. The mapping of these results to the models of integrating digital learning into the curricula showed that the schools' status correspond to the initial phase and further recommendations on successful digital learning integration is provided.

We hypothesized that a higher level of immersion and involvement in a mobile VR disability simulation that leads to a high sense of presence will help the user to improve information recall. We also looked into whether there is any adverse effect of cybersickness on the information recall task in our DS.

The quality of the employed semantic space is a crucial element for establishing an ideal ITS. How accurate the student's responses can be identified and how precise the teaching content can be distributed all depend on the characteristics of the semantic space. A semantic space can be derived from the so-called term-document matrix or word-word co-occurrence matrix. However, how the associated factors, such as the number of terms, the number of documents, and the length of the documents, will affect the quality of the semantic space is still an important question. This issue is particular substantial in some application fields, such as the limit concept in Calculus written in traditional Chinese, where the accessibility of documents might be a problem due to its rareness or cost. In this research, several candidate factors were adopted for evaluating their effects on the quality of the semantic space using semantic representation analysis. Also, a corresponding scree plot is proposed to observe the effect of factors. Moreover, this scree plot can serve as a valuable tool and reference during the process of building a semantic space.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4897-7; POD:978-1-5090-4898-4","10.1109/ICASI.2017.7988509","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7988509","intelligent turouing system;semantic representation analysis;semantic space","Calculus;Computers;Conferences;Education;Matrix decomposition;Semantics;Technological innovation","calculus;intelligent tutoring systems;mathematics computing","ITS;calculus;limit concept;scree plot;semantic representation analysis;semantic space quality;traditional Chinese intelligent tutoring system","","","","","","","","13-17 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A large number of learners globally enrol in such courses. Despite the flexible accessibility, results indicate that the completion rate is quite low. Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics are emerging fields of research that aim to enhance the delivery of education through the application of various statistical and machine learning approaches. An extensive literature survey indicates that no significant research is available within the area of MOOC data analysis, in particular considering the behavioural patterns of users. In this paper, therefore, two sets of features, based on learner behavioural patterns, were compared in terms of their suitability for predicting the course outcome of learners participating in MOOCs. Our Exploratory Data Analysis demonstrates that there is strong correlation between click stream actions and successful learner outcomes. Various Machine Learning algorithms have been applied to enhance the accuracy of classifier models. Simulation results from our investigation have shown that Random Forest achieved viable performance for our prediction problem, obtaining the highest performance of the models tested.

However, field trips are underutilized due to numerous constraints, a situation that current mass development in immersive technologies promises to eliminate. This paper presents an educational project that aims at creating and empirically evaluating virtual reality (VR) experiences for the geosciences: an interactive volcano experience based on LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) and image data of Iceland's Thrihnukar volcano. This work-in-progress prototype addresses the lack of content and tools for immersive virtual reality (iVR) in geoscientific education and research and how to make it easier to integrate iVR into classroom experiences. It makes use of environmentally sensed data such that interaction and linked content can be integrated into a single experience. We discuss our workflows as well as methods and authoring tools for iVR analysis and creation of virtual educational experiences. These methods and tools aim to enhance the utility of geospatial data from repositories such as OpenTopography.org through unlocking treasure-troves of geospatial data for VR applications.

Another continuing challenge is the low level of participation of women and other groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines. As a partial remedy for these issues, we established a Virtual Engineering Sciences Learning Lab (VESLL) that provides interactive objects and learning activities, multimedia displays, and instant feedback procedures in a virtual environment to guide students through a series of key quantitative skills and concepts. Developed in the online virtual world Second Life™, VESLL is an interactive environment that supports STEM education, with potential to help reach women and other underrepresented groups. VESLL exposes students to various quantitative skills and concepts through visualization, collaborative games, and problem solving with realistic learning activities. Initial assessments have demonstrated high student interest in VESLL's potential as a supplementary instructional tool and show that student learning experiences were improved by use of VESLL. Ultimately, the VESLL project contributes to the ongoing body of evidence suggesting that online delivery of course content has remarkable potential when properly deployed by STEM educators.","1939-1382;19391382","","10.1109/TLT.2015.2419253","Innovations in Engineering Education, Curriculum, and Infrastructure (IEECI); US National Science Foundation; 10.13039/100000001 - National Science Foundation (NSF); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081334","Computer science education;computer uses in education;computer-assisted instruction;multimedia information systems","Conferences;Education;Electrical engineering;Games;Logic gates;Second Life;Virtual environments","Internet;STEM;computer aided instruction;computer games;educational courses;engineering computing;engineering education;groupware;interactive systems;mathematics computing;natural sciences computing","STEM education;Second Life;VESLL;Virtual Engineering Sciences Learning Lab;collaborative games;course content online delivery;engineering education;interactive objects;learning activities;multimedia displays;online virtual world;supplementary instructional tool","","0","","26","","","20150407","Jan.-March 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We tested four types of NoSQL systems: Redis, MongoDB, Cassandra, and Neo4j. With each system, students performed a few realistic lab exercises with either Amazon EC2 or Hood VCL. Based on student feedback, while Amazon EC2 and Hood VCL are comparable to students with respect to accessibility, easy setup and maintenance, and reliability, survey results show a majority of students (86%) are more likely to use Amazon EC2 for similar data processing course work in the future. In addition, 64% of students believe Amazon Web Services (AWS) are cost-effective and 82% of them believe that the AWS experience gained on public cloud infrastructure and pay-as-you-go resource allocation is helpful to their career development.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5510-4; POD:978-1-5090-5511-1","10.1109/CSCI.2016.0069","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7881362","Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2);NoSQL database systems;Virtual Computing Lab (VCL);cloud computing;instructional computing platform","Art;Cloud computing;Education;Linux","SQL;Web services;cloud computing;computer aided instruction;educational institutions;relational databases","AWS;Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud;Amazon Web services;Cassandra system;EC2 platform;HOOD VCL platform;Hood college virtual computing lab;MongoDB system;Neo4j system;NoSQL;Redis system;cloud computing;computer science curriculum;database systems;instructional computing platforms;liberal arts college;pay-as-you-go resource allocation;public cloud infrastructure","","","","","","","","15-17 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Correctly locating DNA-binding residues solely from protein sequences is an important but challenging task for protein function annotations and drug discovery, especially in the post-genomic era where large volumes of protein sequences have quickly accumulated. In this study, we report a new predictor, named TargetDNA, for targeting protein-DNA binding residues from primary sequences. TargetDNA uses a protein’s evolutionary information and its predicted solvent accessibility as two base features and employs a centered linear kernel alignment algorithm to learn the weights for weightedly combining the two features. Based on the weightedly combined feature, multiple initial predictors with SVM as classifiers are trained by applying a random under-sampling technique to the original dataset, the purpose of which is to cope with the severe imbalance phenomenon that exists between the number of DNA-binding and non-binding residues. The final ensembled predictor is obtained by boosting the multiple initially trained predictors. Experimental simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TargetDNA achieves a high prediction performance and outperforms many existing sequence-based protein-DNA binding residue predictors.

However apps repositories do not allow them to be easily found. Besides, most mobile devices or their apps are not accessible to people with a visual disability. Recently attention has focused on accessibility issues in this technology. This paper presents an analysis of 94 apps that have been specifically designed for people with visual disability or that could be used by them. The main characteristics of the apps will be examined in order to determine if could be considered as serious games and if they are suitable for users with visual impairments. We will encounter some difficulties in getting information about them because of current inappropriate classifications, unsuitable search terms and incomplete descriptions. Our objective is to improve their classification and therefore their searchability and their ability to make recommendations to users with visual impairment based on the user's profile and on information from their current context. We propose some changes aimed at apps repositories to improve search and classification.","","","10.1109/SeGAH.2016.7586263","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586263","accessibility;app repositories;ontology;serious games;visual disability","Context;Education;Games;Google;Mobile handsets;Software;Visualization","handicapped aids;mobile handsets;serious games (computing)","apps repositories;mobile devices;serious games;user profile;visual impairment","","1","","","","","","11-13 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It assists the progress of learners by creating abilities, impacting qualities, states of mind and determination and expanding expertise. Quality education which empowers the society can be achieved through information and communication Technologies (ICT) in teaching learning process to accomplish the concurred learners' level of ability. The rapid increase in student enrolment, knowledge explosion, advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs), globalisation, economic restructuring, and financial constraints have all contributed to reforms in higher education. ICT as an artifact facilitates information gathering, exchange and makes learning more easy and productive. It also offer students tools for knowledge construction, reflecting, sharing and collaboration in project work, while also connecting to communities, network and resources of their own interest. With globalization, there is a great need for higher education to provide a platform for gradual integration of its degrees with the best available in the world. The implementation of ICT in OBE can effectively accomplish the goals of quality education which is a process that reduces consumption of resources and increases learning outcomes. Quality can be ensured only if institutions can face competition to attract talented students, provide choices and innovate subject combinations. This paper demonstrates the role of ICT to restructure higher education to Outcome based model and its effective usage to improve quality and accessibility of education.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8286-1; POD:978-1-4673-8287-8","10.1109/IACC.2016.155","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7544944","Curricula;ICT;Instructors;Learners;OBE;Outcome;Technology","Art;Education;Face;Globalization;Information and communication technology;Standards;Technological innovation","computer aided instruction;economics;financial management;further education;globalisation;information technology;knowledge management;quality management;student experiments","ICT;OBE;economic restructuring;financial constraints;globalisation;higher education;information and communication technologies;information exchange;information gathering;knowledge construction;knowledge explosion;outcome based education;quality education;student enrolment;students tools;teaching learning process","","","","","","","","27-28 Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

OER are digital contents for teaching-learning purpose available through websites, released under an open intellectual property license to allow their free use for self-learners and educators. The OER-based learning is involved in formal and non-formal education and can be included in different educational environments, including Elearning. However, despite the growing availability of OER, most of these resources are not accessible to people with disabilities. Hence, the accessibility issues need to be addressed in order to include this vulnerable group of population in OER-based learning opportunities. An accessible environment should be twofold: accessibility of resources and accessibility of OER website that offers the resources. In this paper, we propose a process to guide the creation and release of accessible educational resources and their application to a case study. This case refers the creation of an educational resource accessible for people with severe visual impairments and its release through important OER websites. This accessible resource is a full online course that includes downloadable PDF documents. Moreover, OER websites, where this resource is released, are accessible for people with disabilities. Furthermore, this paper highlights the specific considerations for visual impairments in the design of this resource, and accessibility validation tests conducted with automated tools, simulation software, and user testing. The results of this experience allow recognizing certain problems in the creation of accessible resources as well as the limitations of OER websites to serve people with disabilities.

In the last years, both MOOCs and OERs have steadily increased its presence in online learning, especially in higher education. Their massive and open reach have also raised the need of designing them accessible to learners with disabilities. Nevertheless, new approaches are necessary to use them successfully in the context of corporate training where the goal is to facilitate employees learning of job-related competencies within their company culture and goals. This paper proposes an ecosystem to have a sustainable mechanism to enable accessible MOOCs and OERs deployment in corporate training contexts.

These learning environments can take advantage of Open Educational Resources. Using OER is a growing trend and it is turning into a recommendation by some governments and international education forums. Nevertheless, in spite of the availability of OER websites, quite a few of them do not consider accessibility design principles, therefore these websites present access barriers for users with disabilities. Besides, only a reduce number of these websites offer accessible resources, i.e. digital contents suitable for users with disabilities. On the other hand, in web environment, findability is a design consideration that improves the user's searchable experience by simplifying the location and acquisition of elements in websites. In this restricted scenario, findability of educational resources is a key issue for users with disabilities. In this research, we address the issue of findability of Open Educational Resources (OER), from the perspective of inclusive participation of users with disabilities, by considering three aspects: web accessibility, some usability best practices oriented to users with disabilities and Information Architecture.

In order to ascertain the feasibility of this research, we validated the effectiveness of aboriginal virtual patient cases over life patient cases, the following metrics were used: accessibility, privacy, accuracy, security, availability and skill-acquired. Questionnaire, developed based on these metrics, was used to interview 80 medical students and 30 doctors from Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso. A common generic web-based architecture was then developed for the creation, management and evaluation of web-based aboriginal virtual patient cases. In order to evaluate the performance of the developed Web AVP system over existing foreign Web-based VP system, the following performance measures were used: privacy, security, accessibility, user-friendliness, ease of use and efficiency. Forty five (45) medical students and 25 doctors from LAUTECH, Ogbomoso tested the developed Web AVP system and an existing Web-based VP (called Web SP). Results of the initial feasibility study show that medical learners and trainers considered VP more effective in acquiring clinical skills in all the measures used except for accuracy where real patients have higher rating than VP. Furthermore, the developed Web AVP system has higher performance when compared to Web SP in training Nigerian medical students.

CART professionals are widely available at universities as an accessibility provision for d/Deaf and hard-of-hearing students. Several engineering education research pilots indicate that CART can change the researcher/subject dynamic and reduce or eliminate the need for a separate member-check session. This paper explains the procedures and considerations behind employing CART for a qualitative study, including setup details for realtime transcription and the tradeoffs of pursuing such an approach. Following these pragmatic details, we investigate the implications of this technique on researcher/subject positionality and the role of transcription in research methodology.

We propose a game-based learning environment that can be used in class and at home by visually impaired students. The game was developed for middle school mathematics but can be adapted for primary school and secondary school. The main goal of the game is to help and motivate blind teenage students to learn and like mathematics. The graphics are designed for low vision students but to guarantee accessibility to blind students, the game can be played without the need to see the graphics. All the features are complemented with audio and the game uses 2D spatialized audio. Having graphics also contributes to the integration of visually impaired students with their sighted colleagues. The game was tested in two schools with blind and low vision children. Both teachers and students were very enthusiastic with the game and gave us very positive feedback. The results of the test suggest that the game can have a positive influence in mathematics performance.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4799-3922-0; POD:978-1-4799-3923-7; USB:978-1-4799-3921-3","10.1109/FIE.2014.7044493","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044493","education for the blind;educational computer game;game-based learning","Cognition;Educational institutions;Games;Graphics;Mathematics;Navigation","computer aided instruction;computer games;computer graphics;educational courses;handicapped aids;mathematics;mathematics computing;student experiments","educational courses;game-based learning environment;graphics;higher education;human sciences;low vision students;mathematics;visually impaired students","","0","","15","","","","22-25 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tablets and iPads, which are prevalent, can be utilized with dementia patients in portraying favorite music and family photographs via apps developed in close partnership with geriatric facilities. Anecdotal research has shown that non-verbal late-stage dementia patients have become stimulated when iPods played their beloved tunes. There is an unmet need in geriatric facilities for stimulating dementia patients, as well providing hard-core data for proving increased cognitive abilities with technology. Technology can help bridge the gap between patients and staff to improve the quality of life for the cognitively impaired. This study addresses cognitive functioning and quality of life for people diagnosed with dementia via technology. In recent times, the influx of older adults suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia related illness has impacted the U.S. Healthcare system. Cognition significantly declines in older adults with AD or dementia over the course of the disease, causing most to be dependent on caregivers, thus routinely institutionalized. Caregivers are often required to focus their attention on addressing the agitation or discomfort of the AD or dementia patient. Research has shown that technology instruments such as iPods, help stimulate those with dementia. This study focuses on innovative devices such as iPads and tablets, which are mainstream and easy to use, cannot only help determine stage of dementia, but also provide stimulation to improve cognitive functioning. It is hoped that this research will analyze that specially created apps and existing assistive software can be used to decrease the symptoms and improve cognition of older adults suffering from AD or other dementia related diseases. Via service-learning courses, students developed an easy-to-use application for tablets to help- older adults with disabilities more readily use the technology. Student programmers produced apps and performed usability tests with the dementia patients, as well as met with geriatric facility personnel to produce application software that meets the patients, family, and caregiver needs and expectations. For example, a student term project produced an application entitled Candoo that utilizes Google's voice recognition and synthesis engine to navigate the web, provide the weather, and supply pill reminder alerts. Another application example included one that allows families to electronically send photographs, video clips, and favorite music from anywhere to loved ones for enjoyment. Furthermore, older adults were assessed by nursing students for cognitive functioning before, and after the semester's intervention. Such mobile apps could allow dementia persons to become less agitated and stay in their homes longer, while also providing awareness and positive change of attitude by those of another generation towards the elderly. This research will discuss student developed mobile applications in the scope of helping improve the quality of life of patients with AD or dementia.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6245-0; POD:978-1-4673-6244-3","10.1109/LISAT.2013.6578252","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6578252","Accessibility;Aged User;Assistive Technologyies;Computer Science Education;Elderly;Older Adults;Senior Citizen;Software Engineering;Sundowning","Animals;Dementia;Mobile communication;Sociology;Statistics;Tablet computers","cognition;diseases;geriatrics;handicapped aids;mobile computing;patient treatment;speech recognition;speech synthesis","AD;Alzheimer patients;Candoo;Google voice recognition;Google voice synthesis engine;US healthcare system;caregiver anecdotes;cognitive abilities;cognitive functioning;geriatric facilities;iPads;iPods;mobile app development;music;nonverbal late-stage dementia patients;older adults;photographs;service-learning courses;student programmers;tablet application;usability research;usability tests;video clips","","5","","19","","","","3-3 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Work has been transformed from a place you go to a function you perform, whenever and wherever you are. Laptops, smartphones, and tablets enable users to transition seamlessly between work and personal activities anytime and anywhere. The effect of this capability on an individual's ability to balance their work and personal life and manage personal stress remains under study. One thing is clear. Modern societies are still in the early stages of this transformation. While 88% of Americans have cell phones, only 46% have Smartphones and just 19% have Tablet PCs. These devices are fast, powerful, and quickly become integrated into our lives as constant companions. This paper presents the results of a survey of engineering and technology students at a Midwestern university. No significant relationship between laptop use and personal stress was found and work-life balance was only negatively impacted when usage exceeded 3 hours on days off. While significant percentages of smartphone users reported increased stress, similar percentages felt the accessibility of the smartphone reduced their stress levels.

Existing motion recognition techniques are not easy to apply to the smartphone directly, since it has limited resources compared to the desktop or notebook computer. But, smartphones have an advantage over any other computer, since smartphones are equipped with various sensors including orientation sensor and acceleration sensor. Nowadays, smartphones have various input ways to communicate with user through text, image or QR code and user's motion. Also, smartphones are able to communicate and exchange data with other electronic devices using Wifi or Buletooth technique. It gives lots of possibilities to offer convenience to consumers and one of examples is smartphone can be used as an input devices or a remote controller for home appliances. It will be particularly helpful to elders or disabled persons since the phone is the closest to person than any other electronic device on the current human life style. To develop better application software as a remote controller operated by user's motion, the motion should be investigated and analyzed trajectories of smartphone to get dynamic characteristics of user's actions. In this research, three different periodic motions such as tilt, zooming in-out and swing were studied by analyzing trajectories of a smartphone using outputs of orientation sensor and acceleration sensor. The result of our experiment shows that the average one period time of three motions is 1.88±0.07sec while one period time for three motion are 1.84sec for tilt, 1.98sec for zoom in-out and 1.81sec for swing. The result of additional experiment of additional two motions shows that two motions' one period time are within the range of three motions'. At the current stage, the result shows that stereotype of hand motion's one gesture is about 1.9sec, but it needs further research to reconfi- m. However, the stereotype of hand motion's one gesture means that any repetitive hand motion using smartphone could be utilized as one of input way, such as motion of moving up-down and moving right-left. Furthermore, if the motion shows a periodic aspect, user does not need to wait until sensor is stabilized or calibrated at the initial operating stage. The result of this research will be applied to the universal design or barrier free design of home appliances to give better accessibility and convenience to everybody including elders and handicapped persons.","","Electronic:978-89-94364-18-6; POD:978-1-4673-1326-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6418692","design for all;guide line;human-smartphone-interface;motion analysis;stereotype","Acceleration;Character recognition;Home appliances;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Mobile communication","domestic appliances;gesture recognition;product design;production engineering computing;smart phones;user interfaces","Bluetooth technique;QR code;Wi-Fi;acceleration sensor;barrier free design;dynamic characteristic analysis;electronic device;home appliance;human smartphone interface;image code;motion recognition technique;orientation sensor;periodic motion;remote controller;smartphone trajectory;swing motion;text code;tilt motion;universal design;user hand-motion;wireless fidelity;zooming in-out motion","","0","","11","","","","27-29 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is primarily due to the high cost and lack of accessibility to imaging and tracking systems. We provide a software and data infrastructure which addresses both challenges. Our infrastructure allows students, patients, and clinicians to develop an understanding of the key technologies by using them, and possibly by developing additional components and integrating them into a simple navigation system which we provide. Our approach requires minimal hardware, LEGO blocks to construct a phantom for which we provide CT scans, and a webcam which when combined with our software provides the functionality of a tracking system. A premise of this approach is that tracking accuracy is sufficient for our purpose. We evaluate the accuracy provided by a consumer grade webcam and show that it is sufficient for educational use. We provide an open source implementation of all the components required for a basic image-guided navigation as part of the Image-Guided Surgery Toolkit (IGSTK). It has long been known that in education there is no substitute for hands-on experience, to quote Sophocles, “One must learn by doing the thing; for though you think you know it, you have no certainty, until you try.”.

Recently, emotions and human values are gaining space, demanding new directions for the design of systems. As an emerging subject, the need for models that associate emotions and affective quality with human-computer interaction design is still to be addressed. This paper presents a literature review and critical analysis about existing frameworks and models, organizing the state of the art in emotional quality, towards educational system design. This review puts in evidence the missing core in the subject. We then present the concept of Affectibility as the guiding point from which the use and design of system-user interaction could be treated. Similar to the concepts of Learnability and Playability, Affectibility refers to the aspects that make the system of good - or bad - affective, emotional and hedonic qualities, potentially evoking certain affective responses in the users.","","Electronic:978-0-9564263-8-3; POD:978-1-61284-148-9","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5978511","Affective design;affective computing;computers and education;design with children;emotional design;usability","Atmospheric measurements;Educational institutions;Games;Humans;Particle measurements","human computer interaction;user centred design;user interfaces","accessibility;affectibility;affective computing;educational system design;emotional faces;human-computer interaction design;usability;user interfaces","","0","","51","","","","27-29 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The realization of the benefits of grids to a larger extent is based on the effective discovery of resources (which could be heterogeneous in nature) that are part of the grid. Thus making resource discovery an integral part of grid environments. An Accessible grid is one that consists of a collection of devices (or resources) which could be fixed or mobile and the connectivity could be wired or wireless with infrastructure being pre-defined or adhoc. The accessibility criteria requires resource discovery to be dynamic as wireless grids focus on wireless connectivity, mobile grids on issues related to mobility and ad hoc grids on ad hoc nature. With resource discovery methods falling broadly under centralized, distributed and semi-distributed (hybrid) models and computing environments falling under structured (it includes grid and p2p), semi-structured (it includes p2p) and unstructured (it includes p2p and adhoc) categories, the suitability of existing resource discovery approaches to wireless, mobile and adhoc grids is still an open research issue.","1738-9445;17389445","Electronic:978-89-5519-155-4; POD:978-1-4244-8830-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5745863","Computing Environments;Grid;Grid Computing Classification;RD classification;Resource Discovery","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computational modeling;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Peer to peer computing;Wireless communication","ad hoc networks;grid computing;mobile computing","ad hoc grids;mobile grids;resource discovery;wireless connectivity;wireless grids","","1","","9","","","","13-16 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Student role changed to be knowledge and information hunter rather than receiver, and teaching, meanwhile, is becoming a peripheral activity. Several interactive and new methods of learning has evolved in the last two decades aimed to utilizing the information and communication technology tools to improve the educational process availability and accessibility. The learning management system (LMS) is the system responsible for integrating all learning services and managing teaching and learning activities. It provides a collection of tools and functions to support teaching and learning processes, usually including course management tools, online group discussion, homework collections and grading, and course evaluation. This study was conducted to evaluate different open source learning management systems that were under consideration to be implemented by the College of Medicine, King Saud University (CMKSU), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The study reviewed open source and commercial LMS systems as a future strategy. Objectives: the main objective of the current study was to assess the open source LMS systems based on conducting literature review and practical evaluation. The study included a literature review on LMS including commercial and open source systems. The study focused on evaluating three open source LMS systems, Jusur, Sakai, and Moodle. Jusur is the LMS adopted by the National E-learning center in Saudi Arabia, and the other two LMS systems are considered as the principal open source LMS systems implemented worldwide. Methodology: this study depended on published technical reports, LMS systems official websites, and industry reviews, as well as examining the products features and evaluating how they meet CMKSU needs and requirements. Results: All the three LMS systems provide excellent tools including discussion boards, chat sessions- - , and other collaboration tools. Jusur has a strong localization features and technical support and training. On the other hand Sakai and Moodel were ranked better for the user interface and other content and course management features. Sakai is having the advantage of being developed in Java platform. Moodle and Sakai support integration with other systems, while Jusur support the integration in the offline mode only. Conclusion: Open source LMS systems is more recommended because of its popularity among reputable universities, and the benefits of such systems including exchange of experience and e-courses if the development efforts are guaranteed, as well as the availability of the skills required for the development. In the current study, the evaluation focused on the features of LMS systems and a combination of several frameworks to enhance the evaluation process. All three LMS systems provide excellent tools for student interactions and activities. Standards and integration that make these systems able to communicate with other students and hospitals systems are critical features. In addition, the LMS system should be able as well to mange and accommodate a huge amount of information that needed among medical and educational content, including different subjects, lecture notes, lecture videos, text books, videos of surgeries, and radiology images.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8618-2; POD:978-1-4244-8616-8","10.1109/ICEMT.2010.5657569","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5657569","","Biomedical imaging;Educational institutions;Electronic learning;Information systems;Information technology;Least squares approximation","Java;Web sites;biomedical education;courseware;educational courses;educational institutions;information technology;interactive systems;medical computing;public domain software;teaching","Java platform;Moodle;Sakai;Saudi Arabia;Web site;course management tool;educational process;homework collection;information and communication technology;interactive learning method;learning service;online group discussion;open source learning management system;teaching;university medical education","","6","","32","","","","2-4 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By using the effective SCORM-based Sharable CRMS to manage their files, teachers can reduce their workload and thus focus their efforts on substantiating content of teaching. Once teachers upload their content objects, the system would promptly produce a SCORM-based file and create a content package for use and retrieval by users. On the other hand, teachers can browse and download desired content packages through the system to assemble new content objects. Finally, the study proceeds an evaluation and discusses system satisfaction. The internal consistence of evaluation reach up to 0.902 under consistence analysis. Based on the results of this study, several suggestions are also made regarding the design of material filing system for future research references.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5264-4; POD:978-1-4244-5263-7","10.1109/ICIME.2010.5477433","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5477433","Content Respository Managemet System;Digital Content;Grade 1–9 Curriculum;SCORM;XML","Assembly systems;Computer science;Computer science education;Content based retrieval;Content management;Costs;Educational institutions;Packaging;Resource management;Usability","content management;open systems;peer-to-peer computing","SCORM-based sharable content repository management system;consistence analysis;content package;data management;interoperability;material filing system","","0","","10","","","","16-18 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This fact can be also illustrated on the case of contemporary lack of IT students like in other engineering disciplines. The dynamics of software engineering and the requirement that IT should be widely used in other disciplines imply that IT professional should understand various knowledge domains and skills like but more intensively than in classical engineering disciplines. This ability is sometimes called versatility. It is difficult for teachers to teach it as they are induced to do research being typically fragmented into small research areas. We give examples when IT experts should behave like classical engineers and when software engineering specific skills are needed. An example is the solution of the problem of falling interests of young people to study engineering and science disciplines, software engineering inclusive. The solution of this issue can have the greatest long term impact on engineering education. It can moreover change the rules for the accessibility and analysis of the data collected by e- government systems. We show that it is necessary to apply IT tools to evaluate the quality of schools and education systems by the success on labor market.

In this short paper, a third option - a remote FPGA Laboratory - is illustrated. This option uses software to allow students and researchers in geographically distributed locations to remotely access a pool of 64 Xilinx ML-310 Boards over the Internet. To the best of our knowledge, a remote FPGA facility of this kind is unique. The infrastructure described here gives remote users the ability to dynamically power on/off the FPGA boards, upload/download files, configure the boards online and execute synthesized designs while sending input and output through the Internet.

These properties allow new methods to support persons with special needs and handicaps. So far the existing approaches have been able to expand the accessibility to static Web-based information. However, the development of ""barrier-free"" eLearning and eResearch environments is still a barely investigated field due to the lack of concepts to support accessibility of interactive components and to transform between different media types. In this paper we discuss the resulting barriers, and some approaches which have the ability to at least contribute to overcome these problems focusing on eLTR-environments (eLTR := eLearning, eTeaching, eResearch) for mathematics and natural sciences.","","POD:0-7695-2348-X","10.1109/AXMEDIS.2005.5","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1592104","","Communications technology;Computer science education;Electronic learning;Government;Guidelines;Mathematical model;Mathematics;Portals;Power engineering computing;Space technology","computer aided instruction;handicapped aids;mathematics computing;natural sciences computing;teaching","eLTR-environments;eLearning;eResearch;eTeaching;handicaps;mathematics;natural sciences;static Web-based information;virtual knowledge spaces","","0","","8","","","","30 Nov.-2 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the support of the self-regulated system, the learner can identify his best way for learning, where a learner can get supports from the environmental resources in a scaffolding manner and improve his performance of self-regulated learning. Based on the self-regulatory learning and scaffolding theories, two subsystems, ""learning scheduler subsystem"" and ""content accessibility subsystem"", are proposed. The learning scheduler subsystem helps learners schedule their learning process and enhance the capability of self-regulated learning. With the use of the content accessibility subsystem, the instructor can organize the contents and teaching materials such that different level of supports can be dynamically provided to learners. Comprehensively, the proposed self-regulated learning system not only assists the learner to cultivate his self-regulated learning behavior, but also provides the learner a mobile, portable, and personalized learning environment.","","POD:0-7803-8932-8","10.1109/ITRE.2005.1503060","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1503060","","Computer science;Control systems;Councils;Education;Explosions;Fractals;Learning systems;Scheduling","computer aided instruction;mobile computing","content accessibility subsystem;learning scheduler subsystem;mobile learning;personalized learning environment;portable learning;scaffold support;self-regulated e-learning;self-regulated learning system;self-regulated m-learning","","4","","23","","","","27-30 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Learning through telemedicine networks","Liqiong Deng; M. S. Poole","Texas A&M Univ., College Station, TX, USA","36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2003. Proceedings of the","20030206","2003","","","8 pp.","","Telemedicine is advocated for its potential to improve the accessibility and quality of health care delivery while lowering costs. Although the potential benefits of telemedicine have long been a subject of research and intense discussion, the results of actual implementations have been far from conclusive. Most current research, which views telemedicine as a substitute for travel and a basis for economies of scale, is rather limited in exploring the full potential of telemedicine. In this paper, we develop a new framework in which organizational learning is the theoretical basis for explaining the development and potential benefits of telemedicine. We conceptualize telemedicine as an integrated IT-enabled health care network of collaborative relationships. A well-developed telemedicine network is high in density, maintains a balance of strong and weak network ties, and is comprised of a diverse set of relationships. This type of network facilitates learning through the exchange, transfer and distribution of medical information/knowledge, the generation and dissemination of new knowledge about how to collaborate effectively via telemedicine, and the application of this knowledge in telemedicine practice. Viewing telemedicine in this light directs our attention to outcomes not emphasized in most prior research, including the diffusion of medical knowledge and expertise, and the development of collaborative knowledge shared by the health care parties. This paper develops a research model to explain how learning occurs in telemedicine practice, identify factors influencing the learning process, and indicate how thriving telemedicine networks can be built. The model focuses on flexibility of information technology, network density, strength of network ties, and network diversity as key factors having impacts on learning. It also views the acquisition, transfer and sharing of medical knowledge and the development of telemedicine collaborative knowledge as two learning processes occurring simultaneously and recursively, and reinforcing each other. Ultimately, learning is the core process that helps realize the potential of telemedicine.","","POD:0-7695-1874-5","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174377","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174377","","Collaboration;Communications technology;Costs;Current measurement;Economies of scale;Information technology;Knowledge acquisition;Medical services;Space technology;Telemedicine","biomedical education;computer aided instruction;health care;information dissemination;information networks;medical computing;telemedicine","collaborative knowledge;collaborative relationships;health care delivery;information distribution;information exchange;information technology;information transfer;integrated IT-enabled health care network;knowledge dissemination;knowledge generation;learning processes;medical expertise;medical information;medical knowledge;network density;network diversity;network ties;organizational learning;telemedicine networks","","0","","30","","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, the articulation and verification of software system requirements remains one of the most difficult and error-prone tasks in the software development lifecycle. The use of formal methods, based on mathematical logic and discrete mathematics, holds promise for improving the reliability of requirements articulation and modeling. However, formal modeling and reasoning about requirements has not typically been a part of the software analyst's education and training, and because the learning curve for the use of these methods is nontrivial, adoption of formal methods has proceeded slowly. As a consequence, technology transfer is a significant issue in the use of formal methods. In this paper, several efforts undertaken at NASA aimed at increasing the accessibility of formal methods are described. These include the production of the following: two NASA guidebooks on the concepts and applications of formal methods, a body of case studies in the application of formal methods to the specification of requirements for actual NASA projects, and course materials for a professional development course introducing formal methods and their application to the analysis and design of software-intensive systems.

The emulator checks and executes most instructions in the occam 2 language, providing a useful tool for debugging simple occam programs, and also provides accessibility to allow monitoring of execution. A “user friendly” graphical interface is an integral part of the emulator. The paper describes the emulator and its use in teaching the occam language and parallel programming concepts to final year undergraduates. The teaching context is given and laboratory notes outlined along with sample programs that illustrate features of the language","0018-9359;00189359","","10.1109/13.554664","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=554664","","Computer languages;Concurrent computing;Education;Emulation;Hardware;Information analysis;Milling machines;Parallel programming;Programming profession;Virtual machining","Occam;computer science education;graphical user interfaces;multiprocessing programs;program debugging","concurrent programming;final year undergraduates;high-level language;laboratory notes;occam 2 language;occam emulation;occam programs debugging;parallel programming language;sample programs;standard occam source code;teaching;user friendly graphical interface","","4","","22","","","","Feb 1997","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The social significance of our decisions and behaviors is an essence of social sciences, at any level of educational institutions. As compared with natural sciences, social sciences somewhat lack maturity in instructional technology, in Japan at least. The authors focus on the visualization and simulation of cause-and-effect relations in social systems, hoping to make some progress in computer based learning environments for social science education","","POD:0-7695-0653-4","10.1109/IWALT.2000.890635","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=890635","","Computational modeling;Computer science education;Computer simulation;Data visualization;Demography;Educational institutions;Environmental economics;Government;Humans;Internet","Internet;courseware;data visualisation;digital simulation;social sciences computing;teaching","Internet Age;Japan;cause-and-effect relations;computer based learning environments;data accessibility;educational institutions;holistic understanding;human beings;instructional technology;natural sciences;simulation perspective;social science education;social significance;social systems;society;visualization","","0","","3","","","","2000","04 Dec 2000-06 Dec 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents SEDA-VRML, a VR-based learn-by-doing system developed for the training of maintenance workers in the troubleshooting and inspection of power transformers at Hydro-Quebec that is accessible from a Web browser. SEDA-VRML is a prototype application of a reuse-driven design incorporating VRML, Java and an expert system within a user interface system (UIS) architecture. The paper describes the functionality and design principles of SEDA-VRML, with key implementation results, to show how SEDA-VRML's design can indeed answer to the limitations of VRML to act as a cost-effective alternative to traditional operator training systems for operator training in VR, as well as a basis for the rapid development of future operator training systems","0885-8950;08858950","","10.1109/59.780889","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=780889","","Costs;Expert systems;Inspection;Java;Power system modeling;Power transformers;Prototypes;Virtual environment;Virtual reality;Web sites","computer based training;information resources;inspection;maintenance engineering;power engineering computing;power engineering education;power transformers;virtual reality languages","Java;VRML interpreters;Virtual Reality Modelling Language;Web-based virtual environment;World Wide Web;expert system;learn-by-doing system;maintenance workers;power system operator training;power transformer inspection;power transformer troubleshooting;user interface system architecture","","16","1","16","","","","Aug 1999","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For a preliminary familiarization and experimentation with instrumentation and measurement procedures, the use of virtual equipment is often considered more than sufficient from the didactic point of view, while the hands-on approach with real instrumentation and measurement systems still remains necessary to complete and refine the student's practical expertise. Creation and distribution of workbenches in networked computer laboratories therefore becomes attractive and convenient.
