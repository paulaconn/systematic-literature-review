The rapid growth of technology has accelerated the change in teaching methods and has given birth to new methods like distance learning and online learning, where lectures notes and material are shared via educational platforms. This leaves traditional face to face lecture session to a discussion type session where tutor and student discuss about topics and do more class activity. Technology offers new ways in transferring data and information in large amounts very rapidly and also offers the accessibility not only to large information pools such as the internet but also offers access to online storage remotely accessible. One way education can benefit from this is to make use of Quick Response (QR) Code. With its potential, QR Codes can be exploited to change the ways both tutors and students interact in class. This can be achieved by combining Mobile technology, Quick Response Code technology and Cloud technology.","","CD:978-1-5090-2575-6; Electronic:978-1-5090-2576-3; POD:978-1-5090-2577-0","10.1109/ICACCE.2016.8073777","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8073777","QR codes;cloud technology;education;educational platforms;mobile technology","Bar codes;Business;Cloud computing;Education;Mobile applications;Mobile communication;Uniform resource locators","Internet;QR codes;computer aided instruction;computer science education;distance learning;mobile computing;teaching","Cloud technology;Mobile technology;QR Codes;Quick Response Code technology;accessibility;class activity;discussion type session;distance learning;educational platforms;educational potential;information pools;lecture session;lectures notes;online learning;online storage;teaching","","","","","","","","28-29 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous research has found that the use of VR technology in education may facilitate improved learning outcomes. However, it is still an active research topic as the learning outcomes can vary widely and from a practical perspective, mobile VR displays may improve the accessibility of VR while keeping costs low. We hypothesized that a higher level of immersion and involvement in a mobile VR disability simulation that leads to a high sense of presence will help the user to improve information recall. We also looked into whether there is any adverse effect of cybersickness on the information recall task in our DS. The results from our study suggest that participants were able to recall the information effectively and that mobile immersive VR is a feasible modality to facilitate post experience information recall.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5812-9; POD:978-1-5386-1203-3; USB:978-1-5090-5811-2","10.1109/VS-GAMES.2017.8056580","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8056580","","Correlation;Education;Games;Mobile communication;Multiple sclerosis;Solid modeling","human computer interaction;human factors;mobile computing;virtual reality","cybersickness;information recall task;mobile VR disability simulation;mobile VR displays;mobile immersive VR;mobile immersive virtual reality disability simulation;sense-of-presence effect","","","","","","","","6-8 Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent studies have focused on the use or reuse of digital resources with specific reference to the open data field. Moreover, open data can be reused - for both commercial and non-commercial purposes - for uses such as developing learning and educational content, with full respect for copyright and related rights. This work presents a rating system for open data as OER is proposed. This rating system present a framework to search, download and re-use digital resources by teachers and students. The rating system proposed is built from the ground upwards on Open data principles and Semantic Web technologies. By following open data best practices and Linked Data principles, open data initiative ensures that data hosted can be fully connected into a Web of Linked Data. This work aims at sharing good practices for administrative/academics/researchers on gathering and disseminating good quality data, using interoperable standards and overcoming legal obstacles. In this way, open data becomes a tool for teaching and educational environments to improve engagement and student learning.

Geographical barriers, socioeconomic position, race, education, and cost all contribute to health care disparities. These disparities may not only obstruct access to the most appropriate rehabilitative care, but may contribute to psychological problems, reduced quality of life, and unsuccessful return to meaningful community participation. Information and communications technology (ICT) when combined with robotic technology can enhance the accessibility of rehabilitation in low-resource, capacity-constrained settings. In this paper we introduce a low cost, limited supervision, portable robot (H-Man) designed for upper extremity rehabilitation. A usability and feasibility study indicates that out-patient robotic treatment with the H-Man leads to positive improvements in arm movement, and that the system is usable and well accepted by key stakeholders. This paper also introduces an implementation strategy to assess the effectiveness, benefits and barriers of using the H-Man robot for community-based neurorehabilitation in underserved populations, such as those that live in low income neighborhoods or in rural areas.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2432-2; POD:978-1-5090-2433-9; USB:978-1-5090-2431-5","10.1109/GHTC.2016.7857338","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7857338","information and communications technology;low-income;rehabilitation;stroke","Blades;Conferences;Decision support systems;Fingers;Games;Shoulder;Training","health care;human-robot interaction;medical robotics;patient care;patient rehabilitation","H-Man robot;ICT;arm movement;community-based neurorehabilitation in;education;geographical barriers;information and communications technology;long-term adult disability;low cost limited supervision portable robot;low income neighborhood;low-resource capacity-constrained setting;national healthcare system;out-patient robotic treatment;post-stroke rehabilitation;psychological problem;quality of life;rehabilitation accessibility;rehabilitative care access;robotic technology;rural area;socioeconomic position;underserved population;upper extremity rehabilitation;usability","","","","","","","","13-16 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It assists the progress of learners by creating abilities, impacting qualities, states of mind and determination and expanding expertise. Quality education which empowers the society can be achieved through information and communication Technologies (ICT) in teaching learning process to accomplish the concurred learners' level of ability. The rapid increase in student enrolment, knowledge explosion, advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs), globalisation, economic restructuring, and financial constraints have all contributed to reforms in higher education. ICT as an artifact facilitates information gathering, exchange and makes learning more easy and productive. It also offer students tools for knowledge construction, reflecting, sharing and collaboration in project work, while also connecting to communities, network and resources of their own interest. With globalization, there is a great need for higher education to provide a platform for gradual integration of its degrees with the best available in the world. The implementation of ICT in OBE can effectively accomplish the goals of quality education which is a process that reduces consumption of resources and increases learning outcomes. Quality can be ensured only if institutions can face competition to attract talented students, provide choices and innovate subject combinations. This paper demonstrates the role of ICT to restructure higher education to Outcome based model and its effective usage to improve quality and accessibility of education.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8286-1; POD:978-1-4673-8287-8","10.1109/IACC.2016.155","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7544944","Curricula;ICT;Instructors;Learners;OBE;Outcome;Technology","Art;Education;Face;Globalization;Information and communication technology;Standards;Technological innovation","computer aided instruction;economics;financial management;further education;globalisation;information technology;knowledge management;quality management;student experiments","ICT;OBE;economic restructuring;financial constraints;globalisation;higher education;information and communication technologies;information exchange;information gathering;knowledge construction;knowledge explosion;outcome based education;quality education;student enrolment;students tools;teaching learning process","","","","","","","","27-28 Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Upon entering adolescence, patients are expected to adopt a greater role in self-management. However, adolescents often have difficulty adhering to management regimens, which can lead to poor health outcomes. There is a need for a technology that addresses the compound social and technical needs of these patients and their informal caregivers while filling the gaps of current information technology management tools. Through an IRB-approved process, group and individual interviews were conducted with ten adolescents with T1D ranging in age from 11-17 and informal caregivers. The purpose of these interviews was to learn about (1) adolescents' day-to-day management of T1D, (2) the role of the informal caregiver and (3) the role of technology in this management. Qualitative content analysis presented four key themes: the person (the adolescent and informal caregiver), the interactions between the adolescent and informal caregiver, interactions with technology, and physical environments where these interactions occur. These themes led to the development of user-centered design considerations. Final design recommendations included the importance of customization, integration with current T1D technologies, accessibility while maintaining security, and diabetes education. These findings provide insight into remote monitoring features that must be properly addressed in order to ease adolescents' transition to self-management and promote long-term adherence.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0970-1; POD:978-1-5090-0971-8","10.1109/SIEDS.2016.7489311","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7489311","Adolescent Self-management;Human factors design;Informal caregiver;Information technology;Type 1 diabetes","Conferences;Diabetes;Information technology;Interviews;Monitoring;Pregnancy;Security","diseases;medical information systems","IRB-approved process;T1D patients;adolescent self-management;critical design factor;diabetes education;informal caregivers;information technology management tools;physical environments;qualitative content analysis;remote monitoring features;security maintenance;social needs;technical needs;type-1 diabetes management;user-centered design","","","","15","","","","29-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in practice there are still some obstacles, such as learning resources are not evenly distributed, limited access to services provided, qualified educators resources are concentrated in specific areas. This led to the emergence of disparities educational process, and technology gap due to differences in ICT infrastructure owned by any educational institution. Therefore this study proposes architecture of cloud-based open learning to solve these problems. The term open learning is used in order to encouraging the development of the concept of Indonesia Open Educational Resources (IOER) and as well as the adoption of concept of cloud computing. There are several phase that we conducted in this research such as analysis, design, implementation, testing, and evaluation phase. The design of the proposed architecture consists of six layers: (1) Infrastructure, (2) Platform, (3) Application, (4) Service, (5) Access, (6) User. As a result of the implementation from this architecture is a prototype of Indonesia - Virtual Open Learning System (iVOLS). In experiment, personalization e-learning runs as a service that need large storage and other shared facilities to conduct the program so the system can delivered different learning materials to different learners. The e-learning personalization in cloud environment classified successful if the learners got the best performance on learning and it shown by their evaluation score.

These learning environments can take advantage of Open Educational Resources. Using OER is a growing trend and it is turning into a recommendation by some governments and international education forums. Nevertheless, in spite of the availability of OER websites, quite a few of them do not consider accessibility design principles, therefore these websites present access barriers for users with disabilities. Besides, only a reduce number of these websites offer accessible resources, i.e. digital contents suitable for users with disabilities. On the other hand, in web environment, findability is a design consideration that improves the user's searchable experience by simplifying the location and acquisition of elements in websites. In this restricted scenario, findability of educational resources is a key issue for users with disabilities. In this research, we address the issue of findability of Open Educational Resources (OER), from the perspective of inclusive participation of users with disabilities, by considering three aspects: web accessibility, some usability best practices oriented to users with disabilities and Information Architecture.

However, in most of the cases, the computing resources in an organization are not being completely utilized due to various reasons. Adopting some of the latest technologies can improve resource utilization and simultaneously provide other benefits. In recent years, cloud computing has been an emerging technology playing a great role in technology deployment scenarios, making technology more efficient and convenient to use. In this paper, we propose a cloud based architecture that enables maximum utilization of resources and improves the accessibility of information to students, thereby enhancing the learning experience. An architecture based on hybrid cloud model can be a perfect fit, with lot of benefits. The proposed architecture is explained with its benefits, and the security issues, implementation scenarios are discussed.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5013-8; POD:978-1-4799-7977-6","10.1109/ICMIRA.2013.119","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918896","Cloud Architecture;Cloud Models;Educational Institutions;Hybrid Cloud","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Educational institutions;Organizations;Security;Servers","cloud computing;computer aided instruction;resource allocation;security of data","cloud based architecture;colleges;computing resources;educational institutions;hybrid cloud model;information accessibility;learning experience;resource utilization;schools;security issues;technology deployment scenario;technology use;universities","","2","","20","","","","21-23 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These courses are known by the generic name of Geo-MOOCs. A MOOC is an online course that is open to the general public for free, which causes a massive registration. A GIS is a computer application that acquire, manipulate, manage, model and visualize geo-referenced data. The goal of a Geo-MOOC is to expand the culture of spatial thinking and the use of geographic information, enabling geospatial web technologies for widespread use. However, the Geo-MOOCs, by nature, have inherent problems of accessibility. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), Article 24, recognize the right of persons with disabilities to education. “States Parties must ensure that persons with disabilities are able to access general tertiary education, vocational training, adult education and lifelong learning without discrimination and on an equal basis with others” [1]. Therefore, it is important to have accessible Geo-MOOCs. In this paper, we present the results of the evaluation of a Geo-MOOC called “Maps and the Geospatial Revolution” using three tools available for free on the Internet: Chrome Developer Tools - Accessibility Audit, eXaminator and WAVE; and included a selection of web content and geographical data representative of the course. This provided feedback for establishing recommendations to improve the accessibility of the analyzed course. Other Geo-MOOCs can also benefit from these recommendations.","2165-9559;21659559","Electronic:978-1-4799-3191-0; POD:978-1-4799-3192-7; USB:978-1-4799-3190-3","10.1109/EDUCON.2014.6826167","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6826167","Automatic Accessibility Evaluation Tools;Chrome Accessibility Audit;Geo-MOOC;Geographical Information Systems;Massive Open Online Courses;WAVE;Web Accessibility;eXaminator","Cascading style sheets;Geospatial analysis;Image color analysis;Internet;Vectors;Web pages","Internet;computer aided instruction;educational courses;geographic information systems;information retrieval;interactive programming","Accessibility Audit;CRPD;Chrome Developer Tools;Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities;GIS;Geo-MOOC;Internet;WAVE;Web accessibility evaluation;eXaminator;geographical information systems;massive open online courses","","8","","20","","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

According to the prediction of the European Commission in 2015 this sector will be lacking 900 000 professionals. While annually more than 100 000 jobs or employment opportunities are created by the ICT industry, there is a lag in relevant professionals.” (Nemzetközi összefogás az it-s szakemberhiány ellen, 2013) Moreover, this trend is not only impacting Europe as in 2006 58 000 work visas were available in America for ICT professionals. (McCormack, 2010) Although it has become clear that only education can provide an effective answer to the problem of the lack of professional experts, only business firms offer IT and ICT related training opportunities and higher education institutions do not provide programs aiming to meet relevant employer demands. Consequently, any improvement of the present situation requires a familiarity with the concept of ICT along with an overview of is history and continually increasing role in the education process. Thus the present effort aims to answer the following questions: As a direct connection can be established between ICT and Information Technology, since when can ICT be considered as an educational tool? What did the conceptual system of ICT replace? How did ICT supersede the concept of Educational Technology? Can ICT be merely viewed as an all-round education tool, or there is more to its application? “Educational tools or devices are objects, materials, instruments and technological equipment, facilitating the realization of pedagogical goals and vigorously promoting the school-based learning process, specific knowledge acquisition efforts and the direct (in some cases indirect) familiarization with reality via their capability of transmitting, recording, and storing information in an effective way.” (Fodor, 2008) Since when has ICT fulfilled such roles in the - ducation process? “The application of information and communication technology in education primarily manifests itself in a cybernetic, system in addition to a communication theory based planning and organization strategy of the learning and information acquisition process guaranteeing the optimalization of the accessibility and the reception of information with the use of modern information carriers, methodologies, and technologies.” (Kis-Tóth, 2008. p.3.) The present research effort focused on the total spectrum of articles published in full textual form between 2000 and 2010 in the periodical titled Educational Media International. Frequency analysis or computerized content analysis, a branch of quantitative content analysis was the main research method. The main goal of the inquiry was not to perform a statistical analysis on the totality of expressions, rather an examination of the occurrence of such terms as ”Information and Communication Technology,” “Information Technology,” “IT,” and “ICT.” Consequently, the research samples consist of the words of the text, or “mutually independent components of the source language flow.” (Krippendorff, 1960, p.60) The research effort includes the investigation of the textual context of the aforementioned terms via the standard keyword in context (KWIC) method providing a report on the terms:”Information and Communication Technology,” ”Information Technology,” ”IT,” and ”ICT.” It is expected that the research will facilitate the determination of the proliferation time of the given expression, which due to the unique nature of the respective periodical can be dated from the time when education started to provide a response to the challenge of technological development.

Therefore, the possible source of historical data is through oral tradition, which is have limited trace only to several generations back. In order to preserve their cultures and beliefs, a thorough study on remote communities is required in order to present a precise software architecture that can represent their cultures and beliefs in digital form. This paper will discuss the elicitation process and techniques on remote community cultures which related to marriage process, including preparations, events and beliefs before and during the marriage ceremony. These cultures are integrated into a proposed architecture of genealogy software for remote communities. The proposed genealogy software not only accommodates basic information about individuals, including births, marriages, and deaths but the most important component is the culture behind every event for historical records.

Since u-learning heavily relies on ubiquitous computing technology (UCT), features and trends of UCT will be described. In addition, the impact that UCT can possibly bring on the future ubiquitous society is furthermore discussed. Apart from technical issues for u-learning, new questions can arise concerning what are desirable ways of u-learning. As a basic work in this direction, the vision and agendas of u-learning will be discussed in terms of two aspects: 1) building up better and higher level of learning environment supported by ubiquitous computing and 2) establishing a wholesome education community. Last but not least, key elements required for learners in u-learning era are proposed at the end of the presentation, which compose of six core capabilities: cognitive capability relational capability, emotional capability, adaptability, technology literacy and effective learning ability.","","Electronic:978-1-61284-406-0; POD:978-1-61284-407-7","10.1109/ICPAIR.2011.5976940","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5976940","","Buildings;Collaboration;Communities;Education;Pattern analysis;Robots;Ubiquitous computing","Internet;cognition;computer aided instruction;ubiquitous computing","UCT;Web 2.0;adaptability;cognitive capability;collaborative environment;educational issues;emotional capability;instructional activity;learning ability;learning environment;pervasive computing technology;relational capability;seamless computing technology;technology literacy;u-learning;ubiquitous computing technology;ubiquitous learning;ubiquitous society;wholesome education community","","0","","","","","","28-29 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Major findings are as follows: In Lujiazui functional area, with Century Avenue as the principal axis, the area of high global integration roads is wide and its distribution presents a multi-polar development model. In the Finance and Trade Zone, a unipolar development mode was presented, the global integration value is low, and viewpoint movement is particularly important for spatial cognition. Nearly 85% of the road accessibility is good, so the transmission of people, logistics and information flow is convenient; the entire road network is conducive to the coordinated development of commercial, residential, education, industry and other land use types, and there is still room for improvement.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6349-7; POD:978-1-4244-6347-3","10.1109/ICCET.2010.5486300","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5486300","land use type;road network;space syntax;urban spatial morphology","Cities and towns;Finance;Geographic Information Systems;Land use planning;Morphology;Pattern analysis;Roads;Space technology;Telecommunication traffic;Urban planning","geographic information systems;statistical analysis","GIS;Lujiazui functional area;geographic information system;geostatistical methods;land use type;space syntax theory;syntactic parameters;urban spatial morphology research","","0","","18","","","","16-18 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

E-learning system is classified as either synchronous or asynchronous. It is the effective learning process so that the Web-based learning system has become a promising paradigm in education. Agent based E-learning can manage the information overload, serve as academic experts, and create programming environments for the learners. There are several characteristics specific to E-learning system such as Interaction, Personalization, Adaptation, Intelligence, Interoperability, Accessibility and Security. Agent based architecture for E-learning system provides the above mentioned features to support instructional design, to retrieve relevant learning materials, to process and analyze data to enable meaningful E-learning recommendations to instructors and learners. But most of the existing E-learning architectures doesn't consider all the features in a single system. So there is a need for a generic architecture that should support all the features to make the E-learning system more efficient. In this paper, we provide a generic architecture for E-learning system.

This paper uses GIS technology to analyze the distribution of rural primary schools in a mountainous county of China. Analyzing population, school distribution, relevant education resource databases, and combined altitude map, allowed us to calculate the spatial accessibility of every administrative village in the county. The main evaluation factors for school distribution are spatial accessibility, fairness, and efficiency. Using a spatial accessibility index, we constructed a Gravity Model and an Improvement Gravity Model to explore the spatial distribution of rural schools. Through our analysis, we found there were differences in regard to education resources, school distribution, and spatial accessibility in Zhenyuan County, where our study was conducted. In some villages, the education resources are inadequate, some villages the distance to school is too far, more than half of the villages were poorly for the accessibility to school. We suggest that when school adjustments are being made, instead of merely considering efficiency alone, fairness should also be taken into account. Providing rural students with a school near their home is the most suitable and beneficial situation for rural families.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3013-6; POD:978-1-5386-3014-3","10.1109/ICISCE.2017.50","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8110277","GIS;Rural schools;School planning;Spatial accessibility","Education;Geographic information systems;Gravity;Planning;Sociology;Spatial databases;Statistics","","","","","","","","","","21-23 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its employment in scientific and engineering studies often leads to an oversimplification of the underlying flow physics. In reality, complex flows are ubiquitous, and commonly arise from fluid-body interactions with man-made structures, such as bridges as well as from natural flows along rocky river beds. Studying flows outside of laboratory conditions requires more detailed information in addition to time-averaged flow properties. The choice of in situ measuring device capable of delivering turbulence metrics is determined based on site accessibility, the required measuring period, and overall flow complexity. Current devices are suitable for measuring turbulence under controlled laboratory conditions, and thus there remains a technology gap for turbulence measurement in the field. In this paper, we show how a bioinspired fish-shaped probe outfitted with an artificial lateral line can be utilized to measure turbulence metrics under challenging conditions. The device and proposed signal processing methods are experimentally validated in a scale vertical slot fishway, which represents an extreme turbulent environment, such as those commonly encountered in the field.

The main goal of this study is to determine if even people with disabilities can access and use websites of the universities with higher academic prestige. Besides, in our approach we also make use of the Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) is an approach for determining how well a website conforms to WCAG 2.0. The WCAG-EM provides a guidance on using the methodology and considerations for specific situations. From the results, we can conclude that the majority of the tested websites do not achieve an acceptable level of compliance. Universities with high academic prestige do not show a greater level of web accessibility. By performing the evaluation of university websites, we have identified that there are major barriers to a large number of users.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0778-3; POD:978-1-5090-0779-0; USB:978-1-5090-0777-6","10.1109/ITHET.2016.7760703","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7760703","Disability;W3C;WCAG 2.0;Web content accessibility;ranking of universities;usability","Guidelines;Navigation;Robustness;Usability;W3C;Web pages","Internet;Web sites;computer aided instruction;educational institutions;further education","W3C;WCAG 2.0;WCAG-EM;Web accessibility;Web content accessibility guidelines 2.0;Web site accessibility conformance evaluation methodology;World Wide Web Consortium;higher education Web sites;universities","","","","","","","","8-10 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Correctly locating DNA-binding residues solely from protein sequences is an important but challenging task for protein function annotations and drug discovery, especially in the post-genomic era where large volumes of protein sequences have quickly accumulated. In this study, we report a new predictor, named TargetDNA, for targeting protein-DNA binding residues from primary sequences. TargetDNA uses a protein’s evolutionary information and its predicted solvent accessibility as two base features and employs a centered linear kernel alignment algorithm to learn the weights for weightedly combining the two features. Based on the weightedly combined feature, multiple initial predictors with SVM as classifiers are trained by applying a random under-sampling technique to the original dataset, the purpose of which is to cope with the severe imbalance phenomenon that exists between the number of DNA-binding and non-binding residues. The final ensembled predictor is obtained by boosting the multiple initially trained predictors. Experimental simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TargetDNA achieves a high prediction performance and outperforms many existing sequence-based protein-DNA binding residue predictors.

However apps repositories do not allow them to be easily found. Besides, most mobile devices or their apps are not accessible to people with a visual disability. Recently attention has focused on accessibility issues in this technology. This paper presents an analysis of 94 apps that have been specifically designed for people with visual disability or that could be used by them. The main characteristics of the apps will be examined in order to determine if could be considered as serious games and if they are suitable for users with visual impairments. We will encounter some difficulties in getting information about them because of current inappropriate classifications, unsuitable search terms and incomplete descriptions. Our objective is to improve their classification and therefore their searchability and their ability to make recommendations to users with visual impairment based on the user's profile and on information from their current context. We propose some changes aimed at apps repositories to improve search and classification.","","","10.1109/SeGAH.2016.7586263","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7586263","accessibility;app repositories;ontology;serious games;visual disability","Context;Education;Games;Google;Mobile handsets;Software;Visualization","handicapped aids;mobile handsets;serious games (computing)","apps repositories;mobile devices;serious games;user profile;visual impairment","","1","","","","","","11-13 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This expansion of the use of cloud applications comes with some significant learning and adoption challenges to the end users along with the technical advantages that allow greater accessibility and ease of use. The influence of individual user perceptions toward these technologies is an issue that merits further investigation. Several technology acceptance models have demonstrated some degree of success in predicting adoption behaviors utilizing individual user traits and beliefs. However, there have been limited investigations of variables after the technology has been implemented and used. This paper focuses on the associations between variables identified in the literature that are considered to be influencing use and perceptions of technology for undergraduate students of technology at a mid-sized university in Southeast Michigan. The results statistically present significant correlations between each measured variable and support the interaction between perceived ease of use, computer anxiety, computer self-efficacy, and internet self-efficacy with the perceived usefulness of cloud applications in a higher education setting.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8297-7; POD:978-1-4673-8298-4","10.1109/CSE.2015.36","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371372","cloud computing;computer anxiety;effectiveness;higher education;self-efficacy","Biological system modeling;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Computers;Education;Information technology;Organizations","cloud computing;computer aided instruction;further education;statistical analysis","Internet self-efficacy;cloud computing effectiveness;computer anxiety;computer self-efficacy;higher education institution;perceived ease of use;statistical analysis;student perception","","1","","33","","","","21-23 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These electronic resources (e-resources) have enhanced information retrieval and improved accessibility of quality academic materials. As a result, academic institutions such as universities have invested vast amounts of money to make the best use of these e-resources. Notwithstanding these efforts, research shows that, students have made little effort to utilize these resources. The objective of this study therefore, was to identify factors that influence the use of e-resources in higher institutions of learning. Based on the literature, a conceptual framework was developed from the identified factors that were considered to be influencing the use of e-resources. Data was collected using a close-ended questionnaire from learners at different levels of study at Tshwane University of Technology, South Africa. The collected data was analyzed quantitatively and results indicated that; awareness, training programs, reliability of network connections and low bandwidth are critical to the use of e-resources. The developed framework is expected to be used by other researchers while extending research addressing technology usage. Further still, institutions of learning would consider the designed framework to readdress factors that are essential for the use of technology in their settings.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6600-4; POD:978-1-4799-6601-1; USB:978-1-4799-6599-1","10.1109/ICCSE.2015.7250253","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7250253","Electronic resources;Information Systems;Information Technology usage;Online Library resources","Complexity theory;Computers;Libraries;Reliability;System performance;Training","information resources;libraries","South African higher institutions;Tshwane University of Technology;academic resources;e-resources usage;electronic form;information retrieval;quality academic materials","","0","","18","","","","22-24 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, for hearing-impaired students who have difficulties in internet multimedia systems associated with audio and visual information require further design to overcome their limitation. To this end, the present study develops an interactive online learning environment to increase accessibility and interactivity for hearing-impaired students based on hyperlink techniques, modular concepts and online discussions. In particular, for increasing accessibility, in Course Design, to capture attention and arouse interests, 1) we provide pre-course briefing with sign language and lip language, and displaying learning outcome, for reducing cognitive loading, and 2) categorize topics and simplify course contents, for providing enough time to comprehend, moreover, we add 3)self-assessment and online forum as synchronized discussion. For increasing interactivity, in Interface Design, we provide 4) index buttons for fast understanding of course outline and 5) self selection of course, and 6) impressive visual guide to highlight important points and to help comprehension of course contents. Our empirical experiments based on 60 hearing-impaired students showed that the abovementioned five enhancement designs have significant increase their intention to use interactive online learning environment manifested in Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The results showed that the accessibility and interactivity respectively produced significant effects on perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, and then that the hearing-impaired students felt helpful and intended to use the interactive online learning environment as often as needed. However, it was also found that perceived ease of use did not produce direct effects on the hearing-impaired students' intention to use.

This is particularly evident in the case of open access information resources. The idea of open access to scientific information resources promotes use of mostly free of charge scientific information resources thus substituting use of fee based access to scientific information resources. Open access has both advantages and disadvantages. Main advantages would be greater visibility of published research, greater accessibility of scientific content in general, higher rates of citations etc. and disadvantages would be questionable quality of peer review, absence of peer review in some cases, charging authors for publishing their articles, lack of long term preservation policy etc. This paper also presents results of a study of use of digital information resources by students enrolled in two university courses at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Zagreb over period of three years. The results showed that students prefer digital over printed information resources in researched two courses and that they are oriented more towards use of different types of free information resources for writing their term papers instead use of fee based information resources.","","CD-ROM:978-953-233-081-6; Electronic:978-953-233-077-9; POD:978-1-4799-5657-9","10.1109/MIPRO.2014.6859644","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6859644","","Educational institutions;Internet;Libraries;Open Access;Web pages","Internet;educational courses;electronic publishing;further education;information resources;teaching","Croatia;Internet;digital information resources;free information resources;higher education institutions;open access information resources;open access initiative;peer review;scientific information resources;teaching","","0","","28","","","","26-30 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Comprehension of basic mathematics among children with hearing impairment using multimedia in accessible and non-accessible format a comparative study","P. K. Gupta; P. J. M.

Same is the condition for the hearing impaired learners. Multimedia can be a big facilitator in order to render simpler and effective learning methods in the field of teaching mathematics to the hearing impaired students. The guidelines of United Nations Convention of Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD, 2007), makes provision for creation of information in accessible format. However there are no research studies to establish that teaching mathematics through the accessible format of multimedia would increase comprehension levels in children with hearing impairment. According to Mary Ellen Foster (2003) in her study on visual comprehension found that `Intuitively, one way of determining the usefulness of any presentation of data is by measuring the ease with which tasks involving that data can be performed using that presentation'. It may be noted that children with hearing impairment use visual techniques in their thought process, therefore accessible format of multimedia will enhance their comprehension levels. Accessible format includes techniques such as captioning, sign language and audio description. This can be very helpful in processing information by hearing impaired children. The study investigated the effects of multimedia in accessible format, through the use of captioning and Indian sign language (ISL), on hearing impaired children. Hearing impaired viewers watched twice, the short multimedia with and without accessibility formats respectively. Their reactions were recorded on a questionnaire developed for the purpose of the study. Forty nine students participated in this study from two deaf schools of Mumbai, India. Analysis of the data showed that there was difference in the effects of accessible and non accessible formats of on the Hearing Impaired viewers. The study also showed that accessible formats increase the comprehension of the subject of the multimedia- and use of ISL and captioning helped hearing impaired students to understand concepts better. The hearing impaired persons correlated watching the ISL interpreter with understanding the concept of the topic of multimedia. Placement of the ISL interpreter in the screen was also covered under the study.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3216-0; POD:978-1-4799-2753-1","10.1109/CICEM.2013.6820182","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820182","Accessible format;Captioning;Comprehension;Education Multimedia;Hearing Impairment;Indian Sign Language","Assistive technology;Auditory system;Conferences;Education;Gesture recognition;Mathematics;Multimedia communication","computer aided instruction;educational institutions;handicapped aids;multimedia communication;natural language processing;sign language recognition","ISL;Indian sign language;Mumbai deaf schools;audio description;captioning;comprehension level enhancement;hearing impaired children;hearing impaired learners;mathematics subject;multimedia accessible format;visual techniques","","0","","5","","","","1-4 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

According to different sources, the number of users over age 65 has more than doubled since 2000. Besides, the inevitable effect of younger users aging will increase the number of older people using the Internet the next decades. Unfortunately, older people face several challenges when using the web due to diminishing capacities related to aging, such as vision decline, hearing loss, decremented motor skills and cognition issues. On the other hand, e-learning can be an opportunity in helping older people become integrated with the rest of society. In this context, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) bring great opportunities to enhance the quality of life of older people by enabling lifelong learning and inclusion in learning communities. However, MOOCs can present some barriers that could hamper full participation by elderly students. In order to avoid these barriers, MOOCs have to meet different user needs, skills and situations: MOOCs have to successfully address web accessibility challenges for elderly students. The purpose of this paper is to raise awareness towards a better understanding of the web accessibility challenges that elderly students of MOOCs face.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-0086-2; POD:978-1-4799-0084-8; USB:978-1-4799-0085-5","10.1109/ITHET.2013.6671024","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671024","aging users;coursera;elderly people;massive open online course;older users;web accessibility;world-wide web consortium","Aging;Educational institutions;Image color analysis;Media;Senior citizens;Synchronization;Visualization","Internet;computer aided instruction;educational courses;public domain software","Internet;MOOC;Web accessibility;e-learning;elderly students;learning communities;massive open online courses;older people;younger users","","14","","19","","","","10-12 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to develop an e-learning environment that supports collaborative learning one should cope with learning content, communication and collaboration facilities, technological infrastructure, and run-time execution (i.e. learning process). Collaboration scripts are employed to specify the components of the learning process including collaboration and interaction patterns within groups of participants. In this paper we present a Computer Supported Collaborative Learning platform which includes a collaboration script authoring tool based on the Business Process Modeling Notation as the model for the graphical representation of scripts. Collaboration scripts are parsed and transformed to IMS Learning Design Level C learning flows. The second important component of the platform is the run time environment which is based on the Copper Core Engine that executes the IMS Learning Design learning flows and a Message Oriented Middleware which is built over the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol. This middleware layer enables group management and social interaction among participants. The platform integrates external learning tools by implementing the IMS Learning Tool Interoperability (IMS LTI) specification. IMS LTI is used to enable the dynamic integration of external tools through services.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5094-5; POD:978-1-4673-5095-2","10.1109/ICeLeTE.2013.6644340","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644340","Business Process Modeling Notation;Collaboration scripts authoring;Computer supported collaborative learning;Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol;IMS Learning Design;IMS Learning Tool Interoperability;Message oriented Middleware","Business;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Engines;Logic gates;Protocols;Real-time systems","computer aided instruction;middleware;open systems;real-time systems","CoLearn;IMS LTI specification;IMS learning design learning flows;IMS learning tool interoperability;business process modeling notation;collaboration facilities;collaboration scripts;communication facilities;computer supported collaborative learning;copper core engine;e-learning environment;extensible messaging;graphical representation;interaction patterns;learning content;learning process;message oriented middleware;presence protocol;real-time collaborative learning environment;run-time execution;social interaction;technological infrastructure","","2","","26","","","","23-25 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Tablets and iPads, which are prevalent, can be utilized with dementia patients in portraying favorite music and family photographs via apps developed in close partnership with geriatric facilities. Anecdotal research has shown that non-verbal late-stage dementia patients have become stimulated when iPods played their beloved tunes. There is an unmet need in geriatric facilities for stimulating dementia patients, as well providing hard-core data for proving increased cognitive abilities with technology. Technology can help bridge the gap between patients and staff to improve the quality of life for the cognitively impaired. This study addresses cognitive functioning and quality of life for people diagnosed with dementia via technology. In recent times, the influx of older adults suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia related illness has impacted the U.S. Healthcare system. Cognition significantly declines in older adults with AD or dementia over the course of the disease, causing most to be dependent on caregivers, thus routinely institutionalized. Caregivers are often required to focus their attention on addressing the agitation or discomfort of the AD or dementia patient. Research has shown that technology instruments such as iPods, help stimulate those with dementia. This study focuses on innovative devices such as iPads and tablets, which are mainstream and easy to use, cannot only help determine stage of dementia, but also provide stimulation to improve cognitive functioning. It is hoped that this research will analyze that specially created apps and existing assistive software can be used to decrease the symptoms and improve cognition of older adults suffering from AD or other dementia related diseases. Via service-learning courses, students developed an easy-to-use application for tablets to help- older adults with disabilities more readily use the technology. Student programmers produced apps and performed usability tests with the dementia patients, as well as met with geriatric facility personnel to produce application software that meets the patients, family, and caregiver needs and expectations. For example, a student term project produced an application entitled Candoo that utilizes Google's voice recognition and synthesis engine to navigate the web, provide the weather, and supply pill reminder alerts. Another application example included one that allows families to electronically send photographs, video clips, and favorite music from anywhere to loved ones for enjoyment. Furthermore, older adults were assessed by nursing students for cognitive functioning before, and after the semester's intervention. Such mobile apps could allow dementia persons to become less agitated and stay in their homes longer, while also providing awareness and positive change of attitude by those of another generation towards the elderly. This research will discuss student developed mobile applications in the scope of helping improve the quality of life of patients with AD or dementia.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6245-0; POD:978-1-4673-6244-3","10.1109/LISAT.2013.6578252","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6578252","Accessibility;Aged User;Assistive Technologyies;Computer Science Education;Elderly;Older Adults;Senior Citizen;Software Engineering;Sundowning","Animals;Dementia;Mobile communication;Sociology;Statistics;Tablet computers","cognition;diseases;geriatrics;handicapped aids;mobile computing;patient treatment;speech recognition;speech synthesis","AD;Alzheimer patients;Candoo;Google voice recognition;Google voice synthesis engine;US healthcare system;caregiver anecdotes;cognitive abilities;cognitive functioning;geriatric facilities;iPads;iPods;mobile app development;music;nonverbal late-stage dementia patients;older adults;photographs;service-learning courses;student programmers;tablet application;usability research;usability tests;video clips","","5","","19","","","","3-3 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Healthcare, education, business, and many other domains look at cloud computing as an endeavor to solve the continuous shortage in volume, infrastructure, accessibility, and monitoring potency. However, moving data to the cloud implies shifting control of the customer's data to the cloud service provider indefinitely. Hence, the security and privacy of the customer's information becomes an important issue. Being an emerging field, there is a lack of experience in cloud security and lack of consensus on security and privacy. Assessing and comparing among potential cloud computing services, poses an issue for novice customers interested to move their work to the cloud to choose security options that are sufficient and robust at the same time. This paper attempts to identify and categorize a list of attributes which reflect the various aspects of cloud security and privacy. These attributes can be used to assess and compare cloud computing services so that consumers can make well educated choices.

Most of the current existing VLEs are being developed using the system-based approach whereby if an education institute needs a VLE, they need to purchase the whole complete system and install it at their IT server. This limits the personalization of their VLEs in terms of user interface design and functionalities for both students and teachers (e.g. learning and coaching services). In considering the reusability, interoperability and integration of the services, Web 2.0 is adopted to improve the accessibility and flexibility of the web services. In this paper, we propose to develop VLE 2.0 using web services approach whereby the services implemented can be easily invoked, composed and reused according to the service consumer's requirements.

The study included a literature review on LMS including commercial and open source systems. The study focused on evaluating three open source LMS systems, Jusur, Sakai, and Moodle. Jusur is the LMS adopted by the National E-learning center in Saudi Arabia, and the other two LMS systems are considered as the principal open source LMS systems implemented worldwide. Methodology: this study depended on published technical reports, LMS systems official websites, and industry reviews, as well as examining the products features and evaluating how they meet CMKSU needs and requirements. Results: All the three LMS systems provide excellent tools including discussion boards, chat sessions- - , and other collaboration tools. Jusur has a strong localization features and technical support and training. On the other hand Sakai and Moodel were ranked better for the user interface and other content and course management features. Sakai is having the advantage of being developed in Java platform. Moodle and Sakai support integration with other systems, while Jusur support the integration in the offline mode only. Conclusion: Open source LMS systems is more recommended because of its popularity among reputable universities, and the benefits of such systems including exchange of experience and e-courses if the development efforts are guaranteed, as well as the availability of the skills required for the development. In the current study, the evaluation focused on the features of LMS systems and a combination of several frameworks to enhance the evaluation process. All three LMS systems provide excellent tools for student interactions and activities. Standards and integration that make these systems able to communicate with other students and hospitals systems are critical features. In addition, the LMS system should be able as well to mange and accommodate a huge amount of information that needed among medical and educational content, including different subjects, lecture notes, lecture videos, text books, videos of surgeries, and radiology images.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8618-2; POD:978-1-4244-8616-8","10.1109/ICEMT.2010.5657569","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5657569","","Biomedical imaging;Educational institutions;Electronic learning;Information systems;Information technology;Least squares approximation","Java;Web sites;biomedical education;courseware;educational courses;educational institutions;information technology;interactive systems;medical computing;public domain software;teaching","Java platform;Moodle;Sakai;Saudi Arabia;Web site;course management tool;educational process;homework collection;information and communication technology;interactive learning method;learning service;online group discussion;open source learning management system;teaching;university medical education","","6","","32","","","","2-4 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Users who are physically disabled require a variety of access technology and learning depending on the nature of their disability. The intention of modern technology policy is to enable users with intellectual disabilities to have as much choice and control as possible over their lives, be involved in their communities, and make a valued contribution to the world at work. However, in order to achieve these aims, more effective educational and training media are needed as well as an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) for improving their skills and removing the barriers that turn cognitive impairments into intellectual disability. This paper proposes an (ITS) framework dedicated to users who are deaf as a solution for such a challenge.

This fact can be also illustrated on the case of contemporary lack of IT students like in other engineering disciplines. The dynamics of software engineering and the requirement that IT should be widely used in other disciplines imply that IT professional should understand various knowledge domains and skills like but more intensively than in classical engineering disciplines. This ability is sometimes called versatility. It is difficult for teachers to teach it as they are induced to do research being typically fragmented into small research areas. We give examples when IT experts should behave like classical engineers and when software engineering specific skills are needed. An example is the solution of the problem of falling interests of young people to study engineering and science disciplines, software engineering inclusive. The solution of this issue can have the greatest long term impact on engineering education. It can moreover change the rules for the accessibility and analysis of the data collected by e- government systems. We show that it is necessary to apply IT tools to evaluate the quality of schools and education systems by the success on labor market.

The main causes of these problems are the prevalence of password sniffing and the difficulty of password management due to the increased number of accessible systems. In this paper, we propose a personal password management system called ""One Touch Logon"", which replaces the annoying password-based authentication systems with a simple touch-and-login method. The effectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated by implementing it on widely-used legacy systems such as Microsoft Windows and Web site logons. This mechanism is easy to implement and integrate with current password-based systems through the use of an inexpensive consumer electronic device allowing for fingerprint recognition. Moreover, eliminating the burden of memorizing multiple passwords enables the user to choose hard-to-guess passwords and further increases the utilization of Internet services while improving their accessibility. Our empirical study shows that One Touch Logon gives more benefits as the number of employing sites increases, especially when exceeding the number three1.","","POD:0-7695-2687-X","10.1109/CIT.2006.128","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4019947","","Authentication;Biometrics;Computer science education;Consumer electronics;Costs;Dictionaries;Educational programs;Fingerprint recognition;Information security;Web and internet services","","","","1","","16","","","","Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the support of the self-regulated system, the learner can identify his best way for learning, where a learner can get supports from the environmental resources in a scaffolding manner and improve his performance of self-regulated learning. Based on the self-regulatory learning and scaffolding theories, two subsystems, ""learning scheduler subsystem"" and ""content accessibility subsystem"", are proposed. The learning scheduler subsystem helps learners schedule their learning process and enhance the capability of self-regulated learning. With the use of the content accessibility subsystem, the instructor can organize the contents and teaching materials such that different level of supports can be dynamically provided to learners. Comprehensively, the proposed self-regulated learning system not only assists the learner to cultivate his self-regulated learning behavior, but also provides the learner a mobile, portable, and personalized learning environment.","","POD:0-7803-8932-8","10.1109/ITRE.2005.1503060","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1503060","","Computer science;Control systems;Councils;Education;Explosions;Fractals;Learning systems;Scheduling","computer aided instruction;mobile computing","content accessibility subsystem;learning scheduler subsystem;mobile learning;personalized learning environment;portable learning;scaffold support;self-regulated e-learning;self-regulated learning system;self-regulated m-learning","","4","","23","","","","27-30 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings of the","20030206","2003","","","8 pp.","","Telemedicine is advocated for its potential to improve the accessibility and quality of health care delivery while lowering costs. Although the potential benefits of telemedicine have long been a subject of research and intense discussion, the results of actual implementations have been far from conclusive. Most current research, which views telemedicine as a substitute for travel and a basis for economies of scale, is rather limited in exploring the full potential of telemedicine. In this paper, we develop a new framework in which organizational learning is the theoretical basis for explaining the development and potential benefits of telemedicine. We conceptualize telemedicine as an integrated IT-enabled health care network of collaborative relationships. A well-developed telemedicine network is high in density, maintains a balance of strong and weak network ties, and is comprised of a diverse set of relationships. This type of network facilitates learning through the exchange, transfer and distribution of medical information/knowledge, the generation and dissemination of new knowledge about how to collaborate effectively via telemedicine, and the application of this knowledge in telemedicine practice. Viewing telemedicine in this light directs our attention to outcomes not emphasized in most prior research, including the diffusion of medical knowledge and expertise, and the development of collaborative knowledge shared by the health care parties. This paper develops a research model to explain how learning occurs in telemedicine practice, identify factors influencing the learning process, and indicate how thriving telemedicine networks can be built. The model focuses on flexibility of information technology, network density, strength of network ties, and network diversity as key factors having impacts on learning. It also views the acquisition, transfer and sharing of medical knowledge and the development of telemedicine collaborative knowledge as two learning processes occurring simultaneously and recursively, and reinforcing each other. Ultimately, learning is the core process that helps realize the potential of telemedicine.","","POD:0-7695-1874-5","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174377","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174377","","Collaboration;Communications technology;Costs;Current measurement;Economies of scale;Information technology;Knowledge acquisition;Medical services;Space technology;Telemedicine","biomedical education;computer aided instruction;health care;information dissemination;information networks;medical computing;telemedicine","collaborative knowledge;collaborative relationships;health care delivery;information distribution;information exchange;information technology;information transfer;integrated IT-enabled health care network;knowledge dissemination;knowledge generation;learning processes;medical expertise;medical information;medical knowledge;network density;network diversity;network ties;organizational learning;telemedicine networks","","0","","30","","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the growth in employment of all occupations in the U.S. information technology (IT) industry between 1996-2006 is projected at 88.25%, the growth of college/university IT faculty is only projected at 18.3% (http://www.ed.gov). These findings motivated us to propose the NSF-CCLI-EMD project to create a basis for several IT online degree programs in the US colleges and universities. A design and development of the online object-oriented programming (OOP) curriculum is a vital part of this project","0190-5848;01905848","POD:0-7803-6424-4","10.1109/FIE.2000.897637","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=897637","","Educational institutions;Employment;Information technology;Internet;Object oriented programming;Online Communities/Technical Collaboration;Programming profession;TV;Technology forecasting;Web sites","Internet;computer science education;educational courses;educational technology;information resources;object-oriented programming","IT industry;Internet;World Wide Web;colleges;computer science education;information technology industry;object-oriented programming education;occupations;online degree programs;online undergraduate curriculum;universities","","0","","3","","","","2000","18 Oct 2000-21 Oct 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Using virtual reality for distance teaching a graduate information systems course","J. A. McBride; J. F.

Two models tend to dominate current offerings-an expensive audio/video real time interaction place dependent model and an inexpensive Internet based delayed interaction place independent model. By combining the most favorable elements of these models with technology prevalent in the MOO/MUD culture, a new MDU model was developed and field tested. This was a text based inexpensive distance learning model that offered real time interaction and place independent accessibility. The key element of this MDU or virtual learning environment (VLE) model was Diversity University-an experimental object oriented virtual reality college that enables same time different place text based interaction over the Internet. During the Spring 1995 semester, it served as a platform for conducting an entire information systems (IS) seminar style graduate capping course field study. A comparative analysis was done between the VLE course and the PLE (physical learning environment) courses. The replicatable strategy and results of this successful field study are presented. It was found that the MDU model developed was able to satisfactorily replicate the real learning environment for the chosen course. Further it did so conveniently, inexpensively and without compromising the target course learning objectives. A summary of findings and recommendations is presented","","POD:0-8186-7324-9","10.1109/HICSS.1996.493197","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=493197","","Computer aided instruction;Cultural differences;Delay effects;Diversity reception;Educational institutions;Internet;Multiuser detection;Object oriented modeling;Testing;Virtual reality","Internet;computer science education;educational courses;information systems;teaching;virtual reality;word processing","Diversity University;IS seminar style graduate capping course field study;Internet based delayed interaction place independent model;MDU model;MOO/MUD culture;academic institutions;audio/video real time interaction place dependent model;distance learning models;distance teaching;experimental object oriented virtual reality college;graduate information systems course;place independent accessibility;real learning environment;real time interaction;text based inexpensive distance learning model;text based interaction;virtual learning environment;virtual reality","","2","1","11","","","","3-6 Jan 1996","03 Jan 1996-06 Jan 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For a preliminary familiarization and experimentation with instrumentation and measurement procedures, the use of virtual equipment is often considered more than sufficient from the didactic point of view, while the hands-on approach with real instrumentation and measurement systems still remains necessary to complete and refine the student's practical expertise. Creation and distribution of workbenches in networked computer laboratories therefore becomes attractive and convenient.
