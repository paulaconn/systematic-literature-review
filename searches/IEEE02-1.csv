Some software engineering instructors have incorporated projects that either simulate product development for a corporate customer or have students work directly with corporate sponsors to solve a problem or produce an artifact. The rationale for the activity is to provide ""real world"" experience, a foretaste of what a professional in the field will be asked to do. Other instructors may forgo the project as taking too much time from an already full curriculum or due to the difficulty of making and maintaining corporate connections. They rely on the lecture format to convey the material. Are there other reasons for including ""project-type"" activities in software engineering instruction over and above the practical experience they provide? Are there reasons to try to incorporate strategies other than lecture into courses? This paper reviews those areas of educational theory that speak to practical strategies to enhance learning and remembering. Constructivism as a way to view the learning process will be highlighted. Vygotsky's social interaction theory, and scaffolding will be tied to group endeavors. Bloom's hierarchy of the cognitive domain will be viewed in terms of writing course learning outcomes.

It is difficult to teach process concepts effectively in an undergraduate degree but we feel the issue is too important to be deferred to be learned in work experience and postgraduate degrees. Most undergraduate computing courses have a project component that attempts to convey some of the aspects of a `real life' development project but these can easily degenerate into (large-scale) programming exercises if the emphasis is on products and not the process-particularly of students have been exposed to process concepts before commencing the project. Many courses attempt to address process topics-lifecycle, configuration management, etc.-from a theoretical approach, but this serves little purpose without relevant hands-on experience within a realistic project context. Our experience indicates that when taught in parallel with a large-scale project it is often too little, too late. We are making the concept of software process central to our software development teaching and assessment. In order to illustrate the applicability in practice of what we preach, we are applying process improvement concept in the education process itself.

In addition to FFS, we are currently adopting the Five Factor Model (FFM), which is a well-accepted personal characteristic model, to dig deeper the relationship in different courses on IT systems and software development conducted at various universities.

The learning of the basic concepts of circuit theory, the type of concepts and the form of experimentation, traditionally acquired in educational laboratories, are fundamental and demand new and better tools. The teaching of electric circuit analysis requires students to compare theory and practice of “learning by doing”, using physical or virtual didactic benches. Virtual learning environments (VLE) allow the organization of more controlled courses, combining classroom and distance lessons, the use of only virtual classes, new possibilities of interaction over the internet, and a closer interaction between teachers and students. The goal of this project was to provide a virtual environment where students can learn and experiment electrical concepts in a user-friendly environment. The software used for this project was Autodesk® 3DS Max, VizUp, Wirefusion and Dreamweaver. An experimental model was designed, which provides the necessary simulations as well as a variety of configurations, to be used as part of the learning process. This prototype of a virtual lab, referred to as VEMA (Virtual Electric MAnual), was developed at the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Coimbra (ISEC/DEE) to teach circuit theory. The aim of this prototype is the development of three-dimensional replicas of real electrical systems, so that the electrical components can be moved virtually, enabling an easy handling and control of lessons and educational activities in a virtual form. The main objective of the prototype is to be a tool for internet-based distance education (e-learning), complementary to the class contents of Circuit Theory I, also used by students and teachers in or outside the classroom.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4650-8; POD:978-1-5090-4651-5","10.1109/UPEC.2016.8114126","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8114126","3D lab internet;Electronic learning;Interactive systems;Software packages;Virtual prototyping","Education;Prototypes;Software;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Tools","","","","","","","","","","6-9 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we select software engineering course and use Hstar teaching platform and smart classroom as the supporting environment, where students are allowed to choose the learning content according to their own plans and interests. Then we implement the blended formative evaluation method to evaluate learning effect and find that blended teaching pattern can break through the limitations of traditional education and e-learning.

It is important to understand the challenges involved in GSEE for improving the quality and experience of educators and students. This paper reports the findings of an empirical study on the socio-cultural aspects of GSEE. A case study was conducted involving 14 participants from ten different universities in eight countries. The data was analyzed using grounded theory's open coding procedure. The key contributions of this paper are the identification and description of seven dimensions of socio-cultural distance that caused several significant challenges in the courses: 1) language differences; 2) concept of time; 3) attitude toward grades; 4) assumptions about national culture; 5) differences in autonomy; 6) influence of the course lecturer; and 7) work habits. Recommendations from this paper that are expected to benefit GSEE educators and students include: cross-cultural orientation of students prior to the course; use of various strategies to support better comprehension of different English accents (e.g., speaking slowly, replaying recorded video messages, and text chatting); and educators familiarizing themselves and their students with the relevant GSE and GSEE literature.","0018-9359;00189359","","10.1109/TE.2016.2624742","Project ¿¿¿NeXGSD¿¿¿; 10.13039/501100001537 - University of Auckland; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7755765","Curriculum design;design projects;experiential learning;global software engineering (GSE);grounded theory;higher education;software engineering (SE) education;teamwork","Context;Cultural differences;Global communication;Software;Software engineering;Training","computer science education;software engineering","GSEE;cross-cultural orientation;global software engineering education;open coding procedure;socio-cultural challenges","","","","","","","20161123","Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, GT is a complex method based on an inductive paradigm that is fundamentally different from the traditional hypothetico-deductive research model. As there are at least three variants of GT, some ostensibly GT research suffers from method slurring, where researchers adopt an arbitrary subset of GT practices that are not recognizable as GT. In this paper, we describe the variants of GT and identify the core set of GT practices. We then analyze the use of grounded theory in software engineering. We carefully and systematically selected 98 articles that mention GT, of which 52 explicitly claim to use GT, with the other 46 using GT techniques only. Only 16 articles provide detailed accounts of their research procedures. We offer guidelines to improve the quality of both conducting and reporting GT studies. The latter is an important extension since current GT guidelines in software engineering do not cover the reporting process, despite good reporting being necessary for evaluating a study and informing subsequent research.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-3900-1; POD:978-1-5090-2071-3","10.1145/2884781.2884833","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7886897","Grounded theory;guidelines;review;software engineering","Computer science;Encoding;Guidelines;Interviews;Software;Software engineering;Sorting","software engineering","GT practices;grounded theory;software engineering research","","2","","","","","","14-22 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally hardware experiments dominate the electronics engineering laboratory work. Course on Mobile communications has problems due to limited scope of available hardware especially for students' conceptual learning. As a result, the lab work in the Mobile Communications course is carried out using simulation software such as Matlab, Scilab etc. Students are able to verify various concepts studied in theory using these simulations. The problem of using these software simulations is that the students focus shifts from understanding the concepts underlying the experiment to writing the Matlab or Scilab code. We carried out a pilot study to address this problem using the new technology Virtual Laboratories available online. In this paper we present the results of the pilot study carried out with 150 students at UG level and 18 students at PG level in an autonomous college under university of Mumbai using Mobile Communications Virtual laboratory. The results indicate an increase in the students' understanding of core concepts such as frequency reuse, channel fading and various handoff strategies. The students' have given a positive feedback in the course exit survey regarding their experience with the new lab format. They find working with these labs more interesting and motivating. The performance of students in the test at the end of semester has improved in questions related to the core concepts.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6115-0; POD:978-1-5090-6116-7","10.1109/T4E.2016.011","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7814786","Mobile communications;Virtual laboratories;conceptual understanding","Engineering students;Hardware;MATLAB;Mobile communication;Wireless communication;Writing","computer aided instruction;educational institutions;electronic engineering computing;electronic engineering education;fading channels;laboratories;mobility management (mobile radio);virtual instrumentation","Matlab simulation software;PG level;Scilab simulation software;UG level;channel fading;frequency reuse;handoff strategies;mobile communications course;student conceptual understanding;student feedback;university of Mumbai;virtual laboratory","","","","","","","","2-4 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This urges for the enhancements in all aspects of education including engineering. Enhancement of the learning experience for the students, by the incorporation of experimentation in classroom teaching is one of the potential methods to do that. This paper proposes a system for enhancement of the classroom teaching of telecommunication engineering courses by the incorporation of experimentation demonstration with the theoretical concepts using a remotely accessed Software Defined Radio based system. This will allow the faculty members to combine the practical results with the complicated communication theories to provide the students with better learning environment. Also this immediate and tangible experience will benefit the students in applying the complex theoretical concepts that they are trying to capture. Two examples of possible innovative classroom demonstrations of system developed with software defined radio are presented in this paper. To support the demonstration of the proposed system, a remotely accessed SDR based low cost experimentation setup has been designed and developed, details of which is also presented here.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8460-5; POD:978-1-4673-8461-2","10.1109/SAI.2016.7556073","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7556073","Software defined radio;communication systems;engineering education;experimentation;teaching quality enhancement","Constellation diagram;Education;Phase shift keying;Quadrature amplitude modulation;Software radio;Wireless communication","educational courses;software radio","activating framework;classroom teaching;enhance classroom teaching;learning environment;software defined radio;technological capability;telecommunication engineering courses;wireless communication courses","","","","","","","","13-15 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This demand requires engineers with specialized skills and knowledge. For this, the higher education institutions are developing training strategies aimed primarily at lectures and laboratory practices. However, these strategies are insufficient for the development of technical and social skills required by engineers. In addition, currently there is a lack of a common framework to facilitate teaching-learning process and achievement of learning objectives. In this paper, the authors present a proposal for representation of teaching and learning practices about embedded systems, which have been oriented to track and encourage competency development. The proposal is based on the SEMAT kernel as universal framework for representing software engineering practices, defining an extension to such kernel. In addition, a methodology is proposed with a practical approach for creating theories related to computing, this methodology is used to define an extension of the SEMAT kernel for another discipline domain. In this paper, a first form of general representation of teaching and learning practices about embedded system is proposed. The proposal includes the minimum elements that should have any practice of teaching and learning about embedded systems, and the extension mechanisms to represent specific elements.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1074-5; POD:978-1-5090-1075-2","10.1109/CONISOFT.2016.15","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7477909","SEMAT kernel;embedded system;learning;practice;teaching","Education;Embedded systems;Kernel;Proposals;Software engineering;Stakeholders","embedded systems;further education;teaching","SEMAT kernel;competency development;embedded systems;higher education institutions;laboratory practices;learning practices;lectures;social skills;software engineering practices;teaching-learning process;universal framework","","","","32","","","","27-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Especially, more and more distributed control algorithms have been developed for Smart Grids because of their flexibility and robustness. In order to deploy them in real electric power systems, distributed control algorithms must be tested, not only in theoretical simulations, but also in testbeds subject to real world constraints that can provide feedback to make the algorithm robust. Implementations of these algorithms in a Smart Grid environment are facing many cyber-physical challenges such as possible communication failures or imperfections, noisy signals, etc. These challenges can lead to increasing economical expenditure or cause failure of the power system. There exist different approaches for testing distributed control algorithms, from using state-of-the-art facilities to software or hardware-in-the-loop simulations. To better emulate real-world electric grid operation scenarios with low capital investment, in this paper the Green City (GC) testbed is proposed as a suitable platform for both control theory researchers in Smart Grid, and for engineering education, allowing students to learn through hands-on experiences. GC has been conceived as a multi-agent networked CPS with the following main features: 1- Smart Grid environment emulation with low-cost physical elements; 2- Fast prototyping capability of distributed control algorithms for Smart Grid.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1762-4; POD:978-1-4799-1763-1","10.1109/IECON.2015.7392385","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7392385","Cyber-Physical System;Distributed Control Algorithms;Education;Microgrid;Smart Grid;Testbed","Decentralized control;Generators;Graphical user interfaces;Microgrids;Smart grids;Software;Software algorithms","cyber-physical systems;distributed control;failure analysis;power system control;power system economics;smart power grids","CPS;cyber-physical system;distributed control algorithm;economical expenditure;electric grid operation;electric power system failure;engineering education;fast prototyping capability;green city;hands-on experience;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;low-cost testbed;power availability improvement;power efficiency improvement;smart grid;software-in-the-loop simulation;testing distributed control algorithm","","1","","12","","","","9-12 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The PMG-2D simulates a real software development environment where the player, acting as a project manager, goes through all basic phases of a software project lifecycle. There are many roles in the team that have to be managed, and the members have different personalities in order to challenge the player when dealing with people and their conflicts and performance, among other characteristics. The mechanism implemented to control the character's personalities is based on the theory of the Five Big Factors, described by the lexical method conceived in the Psychology area. The evaluation was conducted within the context of a software engineering continuing education course, and 25 participants have played the game and answered a questionnaire. When analyzing the results, it was possible to find evidence that the game, besides assisting the project management training, stimulates the player to learn more about it.","","Paper:978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344168","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344168","Electronic Learning;Management Training;Project Management;Unsupervised Learning","Context;Games;Project management;Software;Software engineering;Training","project management;serious games (computing);software engineering;software management","PMG-2D;educational serious game;project management game 2D;software development;software project lifecycle;software project manager training","","","","22","","","","21-24 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Making such problems manually takes mathematics teachers' precious time which can otherwise be used to mentor students. Many software tools and services for automatic generation of math problems are found on the Web, but all of them provide only materials of high-school level or below. In addition, no standardized methods are provided to evaluate and control the computational complexity of generated problems. General concepts of complexity in various forms can be found in standard textbooks. The authors treat a different flavor of complexity, subjective complexity, where complexity is measured by the difficulty that learners feel. The authors proposed a new framework for evaluating computational complexity from learners' view, aiming to apply our framework to automatic generation of college math problems with controlled computational complexity. To prove the effectiveness of the new concept of complexity from learners' perspective, we developed some automatic generation tools based on our framework. In this paper, we will present one of the tools that supports automatic generation of eigenvalue problems. Controlling the complexity of eigenvalue problems involves restricting the number of calculation steps, the heights of the involved rationals, and the algebraic number fields appearing in the model solution of the problem. The small-scale experiments showed the relevance of our framework. Our system makes a path to strict quantitative control on various complexity from the learners' view. Future work includes the application of our methods to other areas such as differential equations, number theory and so on. We also should prove that this system has a positive effect on the engineering education at college level. Therefore, demonstration experiments in classroom will be scheduled in the next step of our research.","","Paper:978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344123","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344123","","Computational complexity;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Graphical user interfaces;Mathematical model;Sparse matrices","Internet;computational complexity;educational institutions;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;engineering education;mathematics","World Wide Web;college math eigenvalue problems;college math problem automatic generation;computational complexity;eigenvalue problem automatic generation;engineering education;mathematics teachers","","","","13","","","","21-24 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This suite of software is distributed in two ways. One distribution is called the XSEDE-compatible basic cluster (XCBC), a Rocks Roll that does an “all at once, from scratch” installation of core components. The other distribution is called the XSEDE National Integration Toolkit (XNIT), so that specific tools can be downloaded and installed in portions as appropriate on existing clusters. In this paper, we describe the software included in XCBC and XNIT, and examine the use of XCBC installed on the LittleFe cluster design created by the Earlham College Cluster Computing Group as a teaching tool to show the deployment of XCBC from Rocks. In addition, the demonstration of the commercial Limulus HPC200 Deskside Cluster solution is shown as a viable, off-the-shelf cluster that can be adapted to become an XSEDE-like cluster through the use of the XNIT repository. We demonstrate that both approaches to cluster management - use of SCBC to build clusters from scratch and use of XNIT to expand capabilities of existing clusters - aid cluster administrators in administering clusters that are valuable locally and facilitate integration and interoperability of campus clusters with national cyberinfrastructure. We also demonstrate that very economical clusters can be useful tools in education and research.

In spite of their potential for application in several areas of knowledge, such as education, administration and engineering, teaching Fuzzy Logic is also restricted by the absence of an environment to easily develop fuzzy systems. This work deals with the development of a tool for modelling and simulating fuzzy systems. The tool aims to facilitate the fuzzy systems building process. As an important feature, an execution environment to the model has been developed. This feature improves graphical execution, FCL standard code generation and Java code generation. Furthermore, the tool enables collaborative work, allowing that more than one user simultaneously work on the same project. By now, tool supports Mamdani-type fuzzy systems and its implementation is exploited with the jFuzzyLogic library. The tool was used in a class of Artificial Intelligence in the Santa Catarina State University. In the opportunity, the students performed exercises on the platform and also delivered a work proposed by the professor. After that it was conducted a survey with those students in order to evaluate the facility of using the software. The system showed to be efficient and simple for the construction of fuzzy systems as well as for the simulation and generation of fuzzy artifacts. So, it can be applied in an academic environment to practice fuzzy theories, as well as in the commercial context, in the construction of intelligent solutions that use Fuzzy Logic.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5618-0; POD:978-1-4799-7859-5","10.1109/BRACIS.2014.62","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6984848","Fuzzy Control Language;Fuzzy Logic;Fuzzy Systems;jFuzzyLogic;modeling","Intelligent systems","Java;educational institutions;further education;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy systems;groupware;program compilers;public domain software;software libraries","FCL standard code generation;FuzzyStudio;Java code generation;Mamdani-type fuzzy systems;Santa Catarina State University;Web tool;academic environment;artificial intelligence;collaborative work;execution environment;fuzzy artifact generation;fuzzy logic;fuzzy system building process;fuzzy system construction;fuzzy system modeling;fuzzy system simulation;fuzzy theories;graphical execution improvement;higher education;jFuzzyLogic library","","1","","27","","","","18-22 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is not only part of degree programs in computer science or computer engineering but also in other computational disciplines like computational science and engineering. The underlying concepts of parallel computing affect and interact with many areas of computer science including hardware, software, algorithms, and networking, to name a few. Parallel algorithms for problems arising from scientific computing often involve some combinatorial aspects too. In particular, there is an intimate connection between graph theory and sparse linear algebra. A seemingly serial formulation of a sparse Cholesky factorization can be transformed into a block matrix formulation exhibiting parallelism. This transformation is known as nested dissection ordering and can be expressed in terms of a vertex separator in a suitably defined graph. This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel interactive educational model illustrating this connection for classroom use.

Fostering collaborative learning and programming competencies of students through collaborative software development education at undergraduate level would facilitate their amalgamation into the team-oriented and intensively-collaborative, software development industry. In this paper, we propose a framework, CoSDEES, for the collaborative engagements of students involved in software development, in the form of CSD Activity WorkSpace. The proposed framework is based on Activity Theory. Furthermore, we also propose a comprehensive set of requirement specifications for the CSD environment that manifest the proposed framework. These specifications can be used as a set of guidelines for implementing CSD environments in educational settings.

But the design and development of such a game needs much knowledge about all the relevant processes that should be simulated. In this paper, we propose a general framework and a method that can be used for developing project management simulation games for an educational purpose in the software engineering domain. We developed a general simulation model including aspects of ergonomic analysis, work psychology, learning theory and software engineering. With this, we are able to simulate not only the working processes but also the character of the developers. It can be used without understanding the simulation model, so there is no need to understand all the complex content behind. Considering existing solutions, our approach supports different types of games, without making limitations to the game design. We show that with adequate abstraction there is no need to develop an own simulation model for each simulation game.

This device-similar to a webcam-allows an individual to interact with an Xbox 360 or a computer in three-dimensional space using an infrared depth-finding camera and a standard RGB camera. As of January of 2012, over 24 million units have been sold. Using a combination of custom and open-source software, we were able to develop a means for students to visualize and interact with the data allowing us to introduce the concepts and skills used in the field of Electrical and Computer Engineering. The unique technological application, visual appeal of the output, and the widespread ubiquity of the device make this an ideal platform for raising interest in the field of Electrical and Computer Engineering among high school students.In order to understand the appeal of the Kinect, a working knowledge of the technical details of the device is useful. The novelty and appeal of the Kinect sensor lies in its infrared camera, which is comprised of two distinct devices. An infrared projector sends out a 640x480 grid of infrared beams, and an infrared detector is used to measure how long the reflection of each beam takes to return to the sensor. This data set is known as a “point cloud”. This point cloud is a three-dimensional vector comprised of data points between 40 and 2000, which correspond to distance from the device of each beam. The data in this array can then be parsed to construct a 3d image. The Kinect's infrared camera operates at 30Hz, or 30 samples per second, so the device is able to deliver a frame rate that is sufficient to create the illusion of motion. This allows for the development of applications that give the user a sense of interacting in real time with the image on the screen. The unique visual appeal, novelty of interaction, and relatively easy-to-understand theory of operation make the Kinect an attractive platform for recruitment and outreach- Using the Kinect, a recruiter is able to quickly and effectively demonstrate a range of concepts involving hardware, software, and the design process on a platform that students are familiar with and find appealing. In a short window of time they are able to show examples and explain the fundamental principles of the system while providing tangible, meaningful, and enjoyable interactivity with the device itself. This level of approachability and familiarity is rare among highly-technical fields, and provides an excellent catalyst to develop interest in Electrical and Computer Engineering education.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4673-5261-1; POD:978-1-4673-5259-8; USB:978-1-4673-5260-4","10.1109/FIE.2013.6685036","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6685036","Kinect;Processing;Xbox 360;education;embedded systems;engineering;natural interaction;outreach","Cameras;Computers;Educational institutions;Games;Hardware;Software;System-on-chip","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational aids;electrical engineering education;image sensors;infrared detectors;student experiments","Microsoft;RGB camera;Xbox 360 Kinect sensor;Xbox 360 video game console;computer engineering education;data interaction;data visualization;electrical engineering education;engineering outreach;infrared depth-finding camera;open-source software;point cloud;red-green-blue camera","","4","","9","","","","23-26 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The design and development of digital electronic systems is mainly performed by use of a hardware description language. To prepare students in electrical engineering for a career in hardware design many universities provide courses on VHDL. The traditional approach in teaching VHDL is mainly by means of textbook examples and simulation provided by software applications. These exercises are perceived as monotonous by the students and do not or only very slightly correspond with actual real-life applications based on FPGAs. Moreover, most real-life applications are too expensive to be equipped in student laboratories. To bridge the gap between a simulation-only environment and affordable real-life applications students should be provided access to remote real-life setups with a 24/7 availability and preferably shared between multiple institutes. The eDiViDe platform (European Digital Virtual Design Lab, http://www.edivide.eu), see Fig. 1, provides students with this unlimited and exciting access to FPGA based setups. Instead of theory-only courses and a quick basic lab, they can work their way through digital design courses testing their skills on real-life setups to trigger their interest. The platform hosts multiple FPGA setups at different European institutes. These setups are accessible through a web-based interface with video feedback. VHDL development is performed offline, given an entity and specific setup information. All further steps of the FPGA toolchain are performed on the platform. A reservation system takes care of the FPGA programming and student interaction with the setups. Similar initiatives provide stable solutions with educational support [1,2,3]. The eDiViDe platform differentiates with a distributed platform across several institutes and with the support for advanced setups. It is the result of a joint effort and easily expandable with additional setups at any location. At this moment following setups are available: gre- nhouse, stepper motor control, sea noise emulator, state machine workshop, Geffe generator, pong / game of life, traffic light control, MIPS CPU. This set will be extended with more advanced setups that include e.g. a partial reconfiguration workshop for audio/video filters, a side-channel analysis setup and a mars rover playfield. Besides promoting digital design education, the eDiViDe platform creates a channel to make the research activities in the contributing universities more visible. Industry could also benefit from this platform to promote their brand and products to soon to be engineers.","1946-147X;1946147X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0004-6; POD:978-1-4799-0005-3","10.1109/FPL.2013.6645621","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6645621","","Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Europe;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Testing","Internet;computer aided instruction;educational courses;electronic engineering education;field programmable gate arrays;logic design;student experiments;teaching","FPGA toolchain;Geffe generator;MIPS CPU;Mars rover playfield;Pong game;VHDL teaching;Web-based interface;audio-video filters;digital design course testing;digital electronic systems;distributed platform;eDiViDe European digital virtual design laboratory platform;electrical engineering;greenhouse;hardware description language;hardware design;remote FPGA design;reservation system;sea noise emulator;side-channel analysis setup;simulation-only environment;state machine workshop;stepper motor control;student interaction;student laboratory;traffic light control;video feedback","","0","","3","","","","2-4 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There have been some attempts to transfer studio-based teaching to software engineering education. In many ways, this is natural as software engineering has significant practical elements. However, attempts at software studios have usually ignored experiences and theory from arts and design studio teaching. There is therefore a lack of understanding of what ""studio"" really means, how well the concepts transfer to software engineering, and how effective studios are in practice. Without a clear definition of ""studio"", software studios cannot be properly evaluated for their impact on student learning nor can best and worst practices be shared between those who run studios. In this paper, we address this problem head-on by conducting a qualitative analysis of what ""studio"" really means in both arts and design. We carried out 15 interviews with a range of people with studio experiences and present an analysis and model for evaluation here. Our results suggest that there are many intertwined aspects that define studio education, but it is primarily the people and the culture that make a studio.

At the same time, globalization and the need for streamlining time facilitate the development of new methods of imparting knowledge. With the new information technologies, new forms of learning occur adding greater dynamism to the information. This form of learning, which optimizes time and space, is known as distance learning and it is being amply used in many different areas. Distance education presents the advantage of facilitating the teaching and learning processes without face-to-face interaction as knowledge is transmitted, partly or as a whole using technology. In fact, technological innovation has assumed a vital role in education. Looking to achieve more efficiency in carrying out the various activities, the job market constantly requires an investment in new skills and knowledge so that the professionals can operate the equipment and working tools, successfully and with quality. This paper presents a new system of learning a curricular unit of Circuit Theory using desktop virtual reality (VR). The software provides the possibility to understand the relationship between the physical concepts of an electrical circuit, direct or alternating current, through computer simulations and animations. This work was developed to demonstrate how a desktop VR prototype, “Virtual Electric Manual”-VEMA, can be applied to an engineering unit and used to enhance security and resourcefulness in using electrical equipment. Several interactive scenes were developed to illustrate the idea using a measurements and instrumentation laboratory as virtual environment. A range of interactive learning environments are presented: the menu with the first interactive experiment is the simulator of a DC circuit. It allows the student to analyze the setting up of a parallel, or series-parallel resistive circuit series powered by di- ect current; the second menu, features the simulator of an alternating current circuit and demonstrates how the student can perform the analysis of a circuit with resistors, inductors and capacitors; the third interactive experiment is the simulator of a three-phase alternating current circuit; the fourth menu refers to a study on the transitional phenomena. Finally, the fifth menu is an interactive experiment related to the phenomena of resonance. VEMA offers students the opportunity to understand the processes, helping them to better discern the procedures and trains them to interact with the equipment. The VEMA prototype addresses these issues and highlights the potential benefits of using VR for this purpose. Each experiment will provide technical and scientific knowledge in order to give the student/user adequate information and training in the subject.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-0044-2; POD:978-1-4799-0042-8","10.1109/EAEEIE.2013.6576518","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6576518","circuit theory;electrical circuits;interactive circuit;learning object","Circuit theory;Instruments;Laboratories;Prototypes;Software;Training","capacitors;circuit simulation;computer animation;computer based training;distance learning;electric current;electrical engineering education;inductors;resistors;virtual reality","DC circuit;VEMA prototype;alternating current;alternating current circuit;animations;capacitors;circuit analysis;circuit theory;computer simulations;continuous improvement;curricular unit;desktop VR prototype;desktop virtual reality system;distance education;distance learning;electrical circuit;electrical equipment;globalization;inductors;interactive learning environments;interactive scenes;learning process;resistors;series-parallel resistive circuit series;teaching process;technological innovation;three-phase alternating current circuit;time streamlining;training;transitional phenomena;virtual electric manual;virtual environment","","3","","25","","","","30-31 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This may be thought of as a modern extension of Hilbert's ""Formalist Program"", which solved the foundational crisis of mathematics but remained purely theoretical: Even though formal representations are a prerequisite for computer support in mathematics, formalization is a possibility that is usually unconsummated and thus does not have any practical influence on day-to-day mathematics.The Flexiformalist Program aims to change this and calls for1. The development of a regime of partially formalizinga. mathematical knowledge into a modular ontology of mathematical theories (content commons), andb. mathematical documents by semantic annotations and links into the content commons (semantic documents),2. The establishment of a software infrastructure witha. a distributed network of archives that manage the content commons and collections of semantic documents,b. semantic web services that perform tasks to support current and future mathematic practicesc. active document players that present semantic documents to readers and give access to respective3. the re-development of a comprehensive part of mathematical knowledge and the mathematical documents that carries it into a flexiformal digital library of mathematics (FDLM). We believe that such a flexiformal digital library will significantly empower mathematicians, scientists, and engineers in research, education, and application. Our experiences with early approximations of the FDLM show that the approach can be profitably transferred to other domains in science, technology, and engineering.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4934-7; POD:978-1-4673-5026-6","10.1109/SYNASC.2012.78","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6481008","","Communities;Computers;Context;Libraries;Mathematics;Optical character recognition software;Semantics","Web services;digital libraries;document handling;mathematics computing;semantic Web","FDLM;early approximations;flexiformal digital library of mathematics;flexiformalist manifesto;flexiformalist program;formal representations;formalist program;mathematical documents;mathematical knowledge;mathematical theories;semantic Web services;semantic annotations;semantic documents;software infrastructure","","0","","23","","","","26-29 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cyber security research and education is connected to the homeland security agencies and defense through funding, mutual interest in the outcome of the research, and the potential job market for graduates. The future of cyber security is both defensive information assurance measures and active defense driven information operations that jointly and coordinately are launched, in the pursuit of a cohesive and decisive execution of the national cyber defense strategy. The cohesive cyber defense requires universities to optimize their campus wide resources to fuse knowledge, intellectual capacity, and practical skills in an unprecedented way in cyber security. The future will require cyber defense research teams to address not only computer science, electrical engineering, software and hardware security, but also political theory, institutional theory, behavioral science, deterrence theory, ethics, international law, international relations, and additional social sciences.

Today, software is being developed and maintained not just by engineers educated formally but also by people from widely different backgrounds including children, knowledge workers among many others. However, a number of studies indicate that most of these people are not equipped with enough software engineering skills leading to low-quality software. On the other hand, an analysis of literature reveals that the significant potential of learning theories (LTs) like Learning by Doing, Reflection, Model-based and so on has not been fully utilized by Software Engineering Education (SEE) and Training community. In this context, the main thrust of this poster is to emphasize the need for using vast amount of LTs (nearly 110) available to effectively and efficiently teach software engineering and help in producing quality software engineers. In this poster, we motivate the need for use of LTs in SEE, while summarizing significant ones and their use in SE. The poster also presents a mapping of key SE topics and their proposed LTs while emphasizing the role of context in using LTs. The poster further presents teaching Software Product Lines as an illustrative example.

The process of requirements engineering often starts from scratch and depends on very much the analysts' experience and educations. Using requirements pattern can help to overcome this. The patterns can be built and put in a repository. In a case of solving a problem, appropriate patterns can be retrieved and used for providing a solution to it. Therefore, knowledge will be reused and there is no need for starting from scratch. This paper is devoted to introducing patterns in requirements engineering process.

Samad","","Perspectives in Control Engineering Technologies, Applications, and New Directions","20100213","2001","","","","","<P>With cost efficiency a technological imperative today, the future impact of control technology does not depend on new algorithms and theories alone. Such developments need to be employed rapidly, reducing the time involved in deploying controllers for new applications. Furthermore, the insertion of advanced control on a large scale cannot require significant numbers of highly skilled (e.g., Ph.D.-degreed) staff.</P> <P>Thus control technology must be packaged in a form that allows small teams of control engineers to efficiently exploit new research developments and to minimize the cycle time from specification to product. It is a sign of the maturity of control that this packaging is now being accomplished through the development of computer-aided control system design (CACSD) tools. In industries where customized control applications are a frequent demand, CACSD tools that automate several of the steps involved in the practice of control design are now regularly used. At the same time, research continues toward the goal of end-to-end (specification to deployment-ready software) control design automation. No practicing control engineer today can afford to be ignorant of CACSD; it must be considered as much a part of one's professional education as, say, the first course in nonlinear control.</P> <P>This chapter provides an introduction to CACSD, with specific emphasis on control design automation. System modeling, performance specifications by way of mathematical criteria, and iterative algorithms for realizing an ultimately satisfactory controller are among the topics covered. In other chapters in this volume, the state of the art and current research trends in CACSD are discussed in depth from the perspective of two control application domains¿¿¿-¿¿¿automotive powertrain control (Chapter 12) and flight control (Chapter 13).

This has helped students pursue their academic interests, honing their skills from basic to advanced levels in an efficient and concise manner. Traditionally, the standard procedure for electrical engineering students to strengthen their theoretical concepts has been to attend various lab classes to gain valuable experience in design and implementation of classroom theories. However, there may be unavoidable circumstances in any engineering student's life arising from social, professional or medical obligations that may prevent him from attending a theory or practical class. The idea of having a virtual laboratory that can be accessed over the Internet is a practical approach to solving this problem and help students to cope up and sharpen their practical skills.

However, dealing with highly attended courses implies budgeting limited laboratory resources which prevents students from developing their education on electronics totally. To cover this gap between theory and practice we have elaborated a distance learning methodology that complements analog electronics lectures with support for remote simulation of electronic circuits. This methodology is based on the elaboration of several circuit libraries that cover the most important cases explained at the theoretical courses. These libraries can be simulated employing the software resources available at the Microelectronics Design Laboratory (LDIM).

Argyris and Schoumln made a distinction between espoused theories - those that an individual claims to follow - and theories-in-use - those that can be inferred from action -. In the software engineering field, software processes and practices constitute the espoused theory, since it is what engineers claim to follow. But what engineers - and especially apprentices - do may reveal a different theory-in-use. The capstone project provides students, working in groups, with the possibility to reflect on her/his action and that may help making explicit theories-in-use. The course of action theory considers the observable aspect of the actor's activity, i.e., what is presentable, accountable and commentable. The course-of-action observatory collects data on the courses-of-action. This observatory connects continuous observations and recordings of the agents' behavior, the provoked verbalizations of these agents in activity and the agents' comments in self confrontation with recordings of their behavior. A case study, based on the activity of a team of 6 young software engineer apprentices is used to illustrate the building and the data collecting of the course-of-action observatory and the self-reconstruction of apprentices' activity. As primary results of this work, we may think that self-observing and self-analyzing software engineer's activity help to reveal her/his theory-in-use - what governs engineers' behavior and tends to be tacit structures -and it may help them to learn more suitable theories-in-use, thus contributing to improve productivity and performance. In the special case of apprenticeship learning, it may form a part of an appropriate education intended to develop a reflective attitude.","","POD:978-1-4244-4680-3","10.1109/ICCGI.2009.37","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5280088","course-of-action;espoused theory;reflective practitioner;software engineering;theory-in-use","Buildings;Data engineering;Educational products;Industrial training;Information technology;Observatories;Open systems;Productivity;Software engineering;Software performance","computer science education;software engineering;team working","apprenticeship learning;course-of-action observatory;espoused theory;software engineering apprentices;software engineering education;software engineering theory-in-use","","1","","27","","","","23-29 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The practice training was proposed in the semester-long software engineering course to meet the goals that help students to understand further about the software engineering theory and put it into use with personal meaning. The process of the practice training was elaborated in the paper. A bulletin board was built for resource sharing on a local server. All the students enrolled in the course were divided into several teams for project cooperation. After the training an interview study of students was conducted for ascertaining how they felt the process changed the way they learned and the issues they encountered in working.

It is the phase of systems engineering, which is determined by system design for the specified application area. At the same time it became necessary to introduce new technologies for systems engineering. The foundations are the theory of multi-objective optimization and probabilistic modelling of communication systems. These technologies combine two main directions. The first direction comprehends development and realization of the methods for multi-objective optimization of communication systems in order to select optimum designed system versions by vector optimality criterion. The second direction comprehends the development of probabilistic mathematical communication models and appropriate software for communication systems simulation. As a result, we have problem-oriented program complexes for computer-aided communication systems engineering. It is also important to provide methodical and technical training for the specialists in the field of automation of communication systems design.

For an assessment component to be meaningful, it must derive from and support these instructional goals, determine which goals must be assessed and how to assess them, and determine how best to assess whether those goals have been achieved through application of the instructional materials, lectures, and activities which are included in each two-day course. In order to ensure that the course assessments target the intended learning goals, we developed content for low-stakes assessment components grounded in education theory, combining current knowledge of educational psychology and the software engineering domain to create evaluations that will effectively determine whether participants in this course have learned what the curriculum developers and the instructors intend them to learn.","1093-0175;10930175","POD:0-7695-2893-7","10.1109/CSEET.2007.16","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4271616","","Application software;Certification;Design engineering;Educational institutions;Educational programs;Iterative methods;Psychology;Software architecture;Software design;Software engineering","computer science education;continuing professional development;educational aids;educational courses;educational institutions;software architecture","Carnegie Mellon University;Software Engineering Institute;assessment component;course certification;educational psychology;instructional materials;professional development education;professional education program;software architecture","","1","","6","","","","3-5 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We designed and taught a first course in SE, that involved case study approach as well as the traditional lecture based approach. We recorded and analyzed student's perception of learning over using well defined parameters that reconciled with cognitive, skills and metacognitive goals of SE education. Results corroborated that case study approach is more effective and interesting for learning SE than the lecture based approach. These results indicate that academia and industry should further explore learning-by-doing paradigm, specially the case studies. Benefits of approach include bridging of the industry- academia gap and creation of professionals who are well versed with theory and practice and have experienced the intricacies of real software development even before entering the industry. This paper provides empirical data to support that case study approach is very effective in SE education and hence useful for curriculum designers.

Proceedings of the","20040226","2004","","","10 pp.","","The Faculty of Engineering at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Canada has been offering a Master's degree program in Internetworking since 1997. The program also provides comprehensive ""hands-on"" laboratory experience in configuring, maintaining, troubleshooting and simulating networks. The university intends to increase its student base through online education retaining the same quality of interactions as the onsite program. In the online context, the design and the implementation of an effective remote interactive laboratory (RIL) environment is highly challenging on account of the special hardware, simulation and computing needs of the internetworking courses. This paper focuses on translating the onsite laboratory elements into the online RIL environment by allowing students at geographically remote sites to access and interact with internetworking devices located at Halifax. The RIL is devised using de-facto networking standards, free software and commercial Internet browser. Real-time interaction and information transfer with the Halifax site are achieved independent of the technology available to the remote student. The RIL design and delivery mechanism are tailored to: i) provide a constructivist pedagogical approach; ii) model a collaborative learning environment for group interaction; iii) match the characteristics of the delivery media to specific learning processes (media-synchronicity theory) including the provision of unambiguous feedback and guidance; iv) assign appropriate instructional roles; and v) determine desirable student competency outcomes; all in a remote learning context. A 4-tier role architecture consisting of faculty, facilitators at both local and remote sites and students, has been determined appropriate and adapted to maintain academic integrity and offer the same quality of interaction as the onsite program.","","POD:0-7695-2056-1","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265054","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265054","","Collaborative work;Computational modeling;Context modeling;Educational programs;Hardware;IP networks;Internetworking;Laboratories;Maintenance engineering;Software standards","Internet;computer science education;distance learning;educational courses;educational institutions;groupware;internetworking;software engineering;telecommunication engineering education","collaborative learning environment;commercial Internet browser;constructivist pedagogical approach;de-facto networking standards;delivery mechanism;free software;group interaction;information transfer;media-synchronicity theory;online education;online internetworking education;real-time interaction;remote interactive laboratory;remote student;student competency","","2","","33","","","","5-8 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we aim to create an understanding of what motivates people to participate in OSS communities. We theorize that learning is one of the motivational forces. Our theory is grounded in the learning theory of Legitimate Peripheral Participation, and is supported by analyzing the social structure of OSS communities and the co-evolution between OSS systems and communities.

Proceedings.","20030225","2002","","","331","336","We raised issues of how the software education matching to a social request should be carried out in universities in this cyber-world era. In the high-tech era, it is unavoidable that almost all the high-tech products are provided as black-box. For this reason, it, too, is unavoidable that the education in high-tech era will, in stead of extracting the befit of the high-tech stuff, force us to memorize the ""manners"" which were institutionalized by a few high-tech gurus. As basic tools, everybody has to learn word processors, such as Word and Ichitaro, PowerPoint and Excel, and LATEX including tgif. On the other hand, special subjects, such as programming languages, programming language theory, compiler theory, OS theory, DBMS, Internet technology, business models, and software engineering are needed when becoming a software specialist. Mathematics, such as differentiation integral calculus, and physics, such as general dynamics must be also required as liberal arts of software science. The laws related to the patent, copyright, and accountancy for a floatation, and the logical thinking method are the subjects which should be studied as an application subject. In order to prepare the educational environment to study this wide scope of subjects, we must tackle the issues such as restriction of the number of credits and maintenance of lecturer staff. Such issues may be solved by applying less strict criteria when hiring lecturers, reexamining of the whole curriculum, or changing the system of company examination when employing new hires. This paper shows some proposals and remedies applicable to the universities in Japan.","","POD:0-7695-1862-1","10.1109/CW.2002.1180898","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1180898","","Application software;Art;Calculus;Computer languages;Educational products;Internet;Mathematics;Physics;Program processors;Software engineering","computer science education;software engineering","computer literacy;copyright;cyber-world;lecturers;mathematics;open source software;patent;social requests;software engineering;university software education;word processors","","0","","3","","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The received view in software engineering is that truly exceptional designers evolve through practice and that much of the knowledge they employ in design is implicit or tacit in their modes of work. One problem is the lack of well-established theories and axioms for software design and the challenge of showing the relationship between those axioms that do exist and the activities evident in design practice. Another is the challenge of imparting to students an appreciation for the human, organizational, and social factors that affect the design process. We believe that some of the knowledge required for competent design may be surfaced and reified through deliberate reflection on the nature of software design questions, the options identified in response to these questions, and especially the criteria that are identified and applied to selection of a design option. This paper describes an approach that uses design questions, options, and criteria (QOC) as a vehicle for software system design education.","0190-5848;01905848","POD:0-7803-7444-4","10.1109/FIE.2002.1158638","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1158638","","Databases;Design engineering;Humans;Knowledge engineering;Process design;Reflection;Social factors;Software design;Software engineering;User centered design","computer science education;software engineering","design criteria;design option;design practice;design process;design questions;design rationale;human factors;organizational factors;social factors;software engineering education;software system design;software system design education","","0","","6","","","","6-9 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The simplicity and utility of their mathematical treatment are discussed in terms of its educational merits. The major theory is developed using a brush-type permanent DC motor, but brushless DC and stepping motors are discussed as well. They present three sample software packages. One is a simple program which demonstrates the computational principles for the electric current in an LRC circuit or the velocity of a suspended mass. The other two simulate the dynamic behavior of a slide table powered by a DC motor via gears and a lead screw. One is written in Microsoft Visual Basic code reflecting the physical meaning of mechanical components and the other is a Visual C++ version using the class library concept.

Design projects provide a context within which the social and technical aspects of software engineering become visible, yet the legal issues involved in software engineering may not be fully addressed. This lack of coverage of legal issues is the result of the fragmented placement of topics in the curriculum. We are addressing this failure by constructing modules, consisting of scenarios, for our software engineering course to cover the critical legal issues with which our students need to be familiar. These modules can be used independently of particular courses. The first modules are covered, and include 1) intellectual property, 2) privacy, and 3) theories of liability.

Gone is the T-square, the symbol for engineers everywhere, replaced first by AutoCAD and more recently by ""three-dimensional parametric solid modelling"" software. While this advanced computer software may be a better way to learn graphics, the same problem remains: how do we effectively teach this language of engineering to undergraduate students? Sketching is a useful tool in teaching engineering graphics theory and standards to undergraduate students since it allows the student to concentrate on learning the material with less distraction. CAD is also extremely useful for teaching students about design, in particular how constraints are handled and ideas worked out.

As engineering educators, we participate in a process. The notion of a destination is antithetical to what we see as continuous improvement in all phases of our life, including education. The issues of 1971 are similar to the issues of 1995. Issues considered then were educational technology, continuing education and lifelong learning, resources, learning theories, motivation, rewards and students. These issues remain, and we have added quality issues, design and the Internet. Though the issues are relatively constant, the problems are not. A problem then was the availability and proper use of the overhead projector; now it is presentation software. A problem then was the transition from the slide rule to the calculator for individual calculations, now it is the personal computer. A problem then was to be sure that each student learned as an individual, now it is to develop a learning environment where teamwork and quality are major concerns. A problem then was design, and while we have made much progress, we still have work to do. A problem then was evaluation teaching effectiveness of faculty-it still is, but we are starting to make some progress. This conference has has provided an international forum for the exchange of ideas and accomplishments. The ideas have been publicly shared, criticized evaluated extended and improved.

Greenfield is a new model for manufacturing education based on the combination of skill and deep engineering knowledge resulting from an integration of engineering practice and innovative pedagogy. The coalition is creating next-generation courseware designed to integrate training issues with educational foundations. This is being accomplished by combining theory and practice in an interdisciplinary, team-oriented environment anchored to a “real-world” production floor. The Greenfield courses are designed to be modular in nature, and thus offer an ideal educational environment for multimedia-based CBI (computer-based instruction) delivery. In its efforts to standardize all of the Greenfield Coalition's CBI development efforts, the coalition's Information Technology Committee set up a methodology to select an authoring software tool which would best serve the coalition's faculty-based, courseware development needs. Today, intra-university coalition development teams made up of professors and students are designing and producing these learning programs using the innovative educational approaches and advanced information delivery techniques offered by multimedia CBI. This paper summarizes this selection process","0190-5848;01905848","POD:0-7803-3022-6","10.1109/FIE.1995.483233","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=483233","","Companies;Computer aided instruction;Courseware;Education;Educational institutions;Educational programs;Information technology;Knowledge engineering;Production;Virtual manufacturing","authoring systems;courseware;engineering computing;engineering education;manufacture;multimedia computing;software selection;teaching","Greenfield Coalition for New Manufacturing Education;Information Technology Committee;National Science Foundation;authoring program selection;computer-based instruction;courseware creation;educational foundations;educational institutions;engineering knowledge;engineering practice;faculty-based courseware development;information delivery techniques;interdisciplinary team-oriented environment;international member-based educational society;intra-university coalition development teams;manufacturing companies;modular courses;multimedia-based CBI;operational manufacturing/teaching enterprise;pedagogy;production floor;skill;training issues;undergraduate engineering","","5","","5","","","","1-4 Nov 1995","01 Nov 1995-04 Nov 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Fuzzy logic and controller design-a review","A. Katbab","Dept. of Electr. Eng., North Florida Univ., Jacksonville, FL, USA","Southeastcon '95. Visualize the Future., Proceedings., IEEE","20020806","1995","","","443","449","Fuzzy controllers have been proposed for physical systems which do not lend themselves to easy and accurate mathematical modeling and crisp variables, and therefore, cannot be tackled by traditional strictly analytic control design techniques. Instead, control variables are represented by fuzzy variables which let the level of uncertainty of the variables be modeled in a systematic way. In addition the expert knowledge of a typical operator of such a process is embodied in a set of linguistic or rule-based engines which constitutes the core of a fuzzy controller. The magical advantages of fuzzy controllers over the classical ones have been demonstrated by recent results in diverse application domains as well as the surge of commercial products to worldwide consumer market. Thus, the control engineering research, education, and practice have to be revised accordingly. Fortunately, this area finally found its long-expected place in academia and industry, after its first introduction about thirty years ago. Recently, there have emerged many fuzzy logic software and hardware products. The objective in this paper is to give a comparative review of these resources and techniques, and introduce the reader to the state of knowledge in fuzzy controller design research and education. Subjects such as fuzzy set theory, fuzzy logic, fuzzy ruled based expert systems, intelligent control, and fuzzy control will be studied. A number of case studies and applications of fuzzy controls, and some fuzzy logic hardware and software tools are pointed out","","POD:0-7803-2642-3","10.1109/SECON.1995.513133","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=513133","","Control design;Control system analysis;Educational products;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy set theory;Fuzzy systems;Hardware;Mathematical model;Uncertainty","expert systems;fuzzy control;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;intelligent control","control variables;controller design;education;fuzzy control;fuzzy controllers;fuzzy logic;fuzzy ruled based expert systems;fuzzy set theory;hardware;intelligent control;linguistic-based engines;review;rule-based engines;software","","6","","13","","","","26-29 Mar 1995","26 Mar 1995-29 Mar 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system enables freshmen engineering students to enhance critical thinking ability. The power of interactive simulation, animation, artificial intelligence and object-oriented technologies are incorporated to guide the students in the decision-making processes of real-life case studies. The system developed combines theory, experiments, and software tools and can be used in classroom situations or for self/group-learning. The use of intelligent simulation modules is aimed at introductory level environmental chemistry. The currently available three modules are environmentally safe paint preparation process, automobile pollution and fundamentals of gas laws. The teaching strategy of each section of courseware is centered around a text that introduces the fundamentals, theory and links to simulated laboratories.

Through these projects student learn various aspects of software development such as on hand practical exposure, time, effort as well as project management and corporate ethics. But the most important criteria or factor or parameter is that they learn how to work as well as coordinate with team members. For such projects, if not done individually, students are often required to frame a group of some team-size. There are many team building models available and to choose the most appropriate one is principally the imperative chore. Existing team building models such as RandomM, TeacherM, StudentsM and ProposedM were studied. It was found that they are preference-based and hence prone to bias. To overcome this limitation of preference and bias, 10 parameters have been identified and further ranked based on their suitability by postgraduate students and faculties. The results from the experiment show that Job Prospects, Technology and Stipend are top 3 highest parameters ranked by both groups of stakeholder's viz. students and faculties. A new model termed SaiCho, which is preference-independent, bias-independent and deploys consistent parameters, is proposed for deciding on most important parameters for building team for software project development in academic environment.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3239-6; POD:978-1-5090-3240-2","10.1109/ICECCT.2017.8117859","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8117859","Software Engineering;Software Project;Team;Team Building Model","Bibliographies;Buildings;Complexity theory;Organizations;Productivity;Software;Software engineering","","","","","","","","","","22-24 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, the drawback of the non-uniform, which may cause thermal runaway, becomes an obstruction for the development of microwave energy. In this paper, our objectives are to achieve the tracking control of multi-point temperature, ensure the global temperature uniformity, and enhance the system adaptivity for deviation of the temperature detecting position in the microwave heating system with the input constraints. Therefore, a multirate simple adaptive control strategy based on almost strictly positive real (ASPR) conditions is proposed, which multirate sampling and lifting technique is used to solve the case that the system has less inputs than outputs. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.","","Electronic:978-4-907764-57-9; POD:978-1-5386-0718-3; USB:978-4-907764-56-2","10.23919/SICE.2017.8105749","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8105749","Adaptive control;Microwave heating;Multirate sampling;Temperature control","Adaptive control;Density measurement;Electromagnetic heating;Microwave ovens;Microwave theory and techniques","","","","","","","","","","19-22 Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This allows the courses to be taught at a lower cost than if real hardware was implemented. However, the students that are graduating from these programs are missing out on the opportunity to learn about real equipment and issues such as health and safety of voltages above 50V, mismatching component sizes and accuracy. Bespoke electrical power systems teaching equipment is expensive to buy. This paper details a low cost hardware setup that can be used to enforce electrical power system theory. The proposed equipment employs real off-the shelf equipment with some interfacing units which can be reproduced by laboratory technicians to enhance the student learning experience by offering students experience of real machines operating on an electrical power systems network.","","Electronic:978-90-75815-27-6; POD:978-1-5386-0530-1; USB:978-90-75815-26-9","10.23919/EPE17ECCEEurope.2017.8098945","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8098945","Microgrids;Power Engineering;Power System Control;stability;supervised learning","Education;Europe;Generators;Hardware;Industries;Power electronics;Power system stability","","","","","","","","","","11-14 Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Top motivations for choosing tools are simplicity of learning and installing, as well as the tools being free and supporting the most important notations. Top complaints about tools included not interacting with other tools, not supporting sufficient modeling aspects, and being complex to use. Seven of the tools were used by more than one professor as their main tools, and we analyzed these in more depth. Among these 7, lack of feedback about models emerged as another key weakness. The tools varied very considerably regarding which of these strengths and weaknesses they exhibited. The key lessons from the paper are a) that tool developers have many opportunities to improve their products, and b) that educators might benefit from introducing students to multiple different tools.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3492-9; POD:978-1-5386-3493-6","10.1109/MODELS.2017.1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8101276","education;modeling tool;survey","Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Education;Software;Software engineering;Tools;Unified modeling language","","","","","","","","","","17-22 Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, course and laboratory objectives are not always clearly stated. Without a clear set of objectives, it can be hard to design a learning experience and determine whether students are achieving the intended outcomes of the course or laboratory. In this paper, a common set of laboratory objectives, concepts, and components of a laboratory apparatus for undergraduate control systems laboratories were identified. A panel of 40 control systems faculty members completed a multi-round Delphi survey to bring them toward consensus on the common aspects of their laboratories. These panelists identified 15 laboratory objectives, 26 concepts, and 15 components common to their laboratories. Then an 45 additional faculty members and practitioners completed a follow-up survey to gather feedback on the results. In both surveys, each participant rated the importance of each item. While average ratings differed slightly between the two groups, the order in which the items were ranked was similar. Important examples of common learning objectives include connecting theory to what is implemented in the laboratory, designing controllers, and modeling systems. The most common component in both groups was MathWorks software. Some of the common concepts include block diagrams, stability, and PID control.

This study take the same approach to make intra predictions as H.264 and this study adopt the fractal theory to make inter predictions. Some improvements are introduced in this algorithm. First, luminance and chrominance components are coded separately and the partitions are no longer associated as in H.264. Second, the partition mode for chrominance components has been changed and the block size now rages from 16 × 16 to 4 × 4, which is the same as luminance components. Third, this study introduced adaptive quantization parameter offset, changing the offset for every frame in the quantization process to acquire better reconstructed image. Comparison between the improved algorithm, the original fractal compress algorithm and JM19.0 (The latest H.264/AVC reference software) confirms a slightly increase in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, a significant decrease in bitrate while the time consumed for compression remains less than 60% of that using JM19.0.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2745538","Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars from the State Education Ministry of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8024180","H.264/AVC;Video compression;fractal theory;inter-frame prediction","Encoding;Extraterrestrial measurements;Fractals;Image coding;Prediction algorithms;Transforms","data compression;fractals;image reconstruction;quantisation (signal);video coding","H.264;adaptive quantization parameter offset;chrominance components;fractal theory;image reconstruction;improved interframe prediction algorithm;luminance components;original fractal compress algorithm;video coding standard;video compression;video sequences","","","","","","OAPA","20170901","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the proposed hybrid method, the domains where only the zeroth-order parallel-plate mode exists are modeled by the 2-D DGTD, and the remaining domains are modeled by the 3-D DGTD. Each element is independent with others, thus easily parallelizable. Because higher order modes will propagate in the parallel-plate pair, the spatial domain decomposition should be time-dependent. For domain decomposition criterion at time step t<sub>n</sub>, the electromagnetic field distribution at the previous time step t<sub>n-1</sub> is analyzed to identify the zeroth-order parallel mode domain. Compared with the classical static distance criterion, this new adaptive criterion makes the approximation error under control, thus enhancing the stability. The accuracy and flexibility of the hybrid method have been validated by comparison with commercial software.

While participating in Project HALON, teams of middle school and high school researchers progress through a modified version of NASA's systems engineering process to develop a near-space research experiment. Undergraduate mentors guide the teams through a series of reviews to propose an experiment to collect data and ensure that the design performs properly during ground testing. Through Project HALON, students cultivate authentic research skills, expand their knowledge of near-space science, and gain confidence to meet the challenges of more advanced STEM-related courses and learning opportunities.

In this model, based on the individual utility, the strategy state will be asynchronously updated according to the Fermi-like rule. Among them, each individual will be initially endowed with an integral reputation value, and then it evolves during the evolution of strategy; while for the individual utility, it is characterized as the product of the game payoff and a power function of reputation value. Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method is adopted here to verify the system's evolutionary characteristics, and large quantities of simulations demonstrate that the cooperation behavior can be greatly varied and enhanced when the reputation is incorporated into the utility evaluation. Detailed strategy distribution proves that the individual with large reputation value renders the cooperators to lower their risks to be reaped by defectors, and dominates the evolution of cooperation within the whole population. In addition, the whole cooperation phase diagrams show that the coexistence region of cooperators and defectors becomes narrower and narrower as the reputation is introduced more and more. Meanwhile, it is also displayed that the reputation effect favors the evolution of cooperation, and greatly fosters the cooperators to form the compact clusters so as to reduce the risk of being invaded by defectors. To summarize, current results are conducive to making a deeper insight into the evolution of collective cooperation within many real-world biological and man-made systems.","1932-8184;19328184","","10.1109/JSYST.2016.2539364","Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars (Ministry of Education); 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC); 10.13039/501100002858 - China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7448876","Cooperation risk analysis;promotion of cooperation;public goods game (PGG);reputation effect;spatial reciprocity","Analytical models;Evolution (biology);Games;Lattices;Risk analysis;Sociology","Monte Carlo methods;economics;evolutionary computation;game theory;risk analysis;utility theory","Fermi-like rule;MCS;Monte Carlo simulation;PGG;cooperation yielded;evolutionary game;individual utility;risk analysis;risk enhancement;spatial public goods game;utility evaluation","","","","","","Traditional","20160407","Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Learners find it very complex and unrelated as mere lecturing doesn't help them in effective interpretation of the information conveyed. There are many such software tools available nowadays having a powerful graphical data flow programming environment with a rich set of library functions and tools sets in simulation and real time mode. Such tools can simplify the teaching and learning of subjects with intense mathematical background in lesser time for the students from non-electronics stream. Here we present the efforts of teachers in learning and teaching, Signal acquisition, processing and analysis techniques for sixth semester students of Automation and Robotics in a much effective manner, using LabVIEW tool. The processed data can be presented from the tool using measurement graphs, indicators, animations, tabulated data, automated calculations, physical interpretation, visualization effects etc., thus enabling the learner with better understanding of concepts.

If the people have knowledge about microorganisms, it can control the microbes that cause the wicked things, and it can also be useful to use microorganisms effectively. Currently, the study still use the microscope in the education. There are limitations when exploring various cycles, it will not be able to explore as the time required. As the cycles of nature, it must have time as a variable. Therefore, the microscope helps to see the structure clearer only, but it cannot see all the natural cycles covered by a single microscope. Therefore, this research uses the Augmented Reality technology to be developed as instructional media (A case study of Phylum Basidiomycota, the fungi, which is considered to be the most complex internal structure). This helps to visualize the three-dimensional structure and cycles of nature from electronic devices. But the problem of instructional media created with Augmented Reality technology is that it is inaccessible and difficult to use. The researcher has developed together with online instructional media for easy access, and designed instructional media with the theory of Shneiderman's 8 Golden Rules for ease of use, and measured the performance with real applications by the third-year students of the Faculty of Science, Khon kaen University.

In this paper, an adaptive inter CU depth decision algorithm is proposed, which exploits both temporal correlation of CU depth and available encoding parameters. An optimal selection model of CU depth is established to estimate the range of candidate CU depth by exploiting the temporal correlation of CU depth among current CU and temporally co-located CUs. To reduce the accumulated errors in the process of CU depth prediction, the maximum depth of the co-located CUs and the coded block flag (CBF) of the current CU are used. Moreover, PU size and CBF information are also used to decide the maximum depth for the current CU. Experimental results show that the proposed CU depth decision approach reduces 56.3% and 51.5% average encoding time, and the Bjontegaard delta bit rate increases only 1.3% and 1.1% for various test sequences under the random access and the low delay B conditions, respectively.","0018-9316;00189316","","10.1109/TBC.2017.2704423","Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7940104","CU depth;High efficiency video coding (HEVC);coding unit (CU);prediction unit (PU)","Adaptation models;Bayes methods;Complexity theory;Copper;Correlation;Encoding;Video coding","encoding;video coding","Bjontegaard delta bit rate;CBF;CU depth prediction;H.264-AVC high profile;adaptive inter CU depth decision algorithm;coded block flag;coding efficiency;coding unit;computational complexity;encoding parameters;hierarchical coding structure;hierarchical unit partitioning strategy;high efficiency video coding;optimal selection model;prediction unit;temporal correlation","","","","","","","20170606","Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The concept of adaptive e-learning and autonomous agents were applied in this system to eliminate the traditional constraints of effective e-learning, such as the problem of different learning sensory and knowledge levels. Four approaches were used to solve this problem. First, learning style theory was used to classify the way of learning for each student. Second, the student activity (historical data) is kept in the system to analyze the next knowledge the student should learn or review. Next, the SQL query automated grader was used to judge the correctness of the student's query. This grader supports all the necessary commands in both DML and DDL. Finally, the SQL query question generator module that can generate SQL query questions automatically is presented.

We conducted an empirical study with 17 postgraduate students in the context of mobile applications design. We used coding procedures from the Grounded Theory method for analyzing the obtained qualitative data. Based on the results, we identified some difficulties that participants experienced in using different DT techniques. The results of this study can help teachers understand the difficulties faced by students in learning DT and, consequently, help them to look for new teaching strategies for their classes. Moreover, these results can contribute to the software industry showing the competitive advantages of using DT in the design of the applications under development, especially in mobile applications.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2671-9; POD:978-1-5386-2672-6","10.1109/ICSE-SEET.2017.10","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7964332","Design Thinking;mobile application design;qualitative analysis","Creativity;Education;Mobile applications;Software;Software engineering;Technological innovation","computer science education;educational courses;mobile computing;software engineering;teaching","coding procedures;computer science;design thinking;grounded theory method;mobile applications design;qualitative data analysis;software development industry;software engineering courses;teaching strategies;technological artifact design","","","","","","","","20-28 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, software-defined networking has emerged as a promising approach to the definition of network architectures that could carry a high degree of adaptability and robustness reminiscent of the future Internet. Fault tolerance and network updates are considered two of the current research challenges that hamper the growth of software-defined networking in this area. Therefore, this paper represents a step toward tackling these two issues in the context of single link failures. Our main contribution lies in the definition of new algorithms that aim to enhance the problem of finding alternative paths in large-scale networks with minimal cost and time-to-update factors. The new solution aims at increasing the efficiency of flow operation reduction during link failures. We evaluate our framework and show how its implementation results in improved efficiency.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2736949","College of Computer Science and Information Technology at the University of Al-Qadisiyah through the Scholarship Program of the Iraqi Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research; 10.13039/100009153 - University of Portsmouth; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8003259","Fault-tolerance;network topology;optimisation;resilience;software-defined networks","Complexity theory;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Network architecture;Tools;Topology","Internet;software defined networking","Internet resources;cost factors;future Internet;large-scale networks;network architectures;optimisation methods;software-defined networks;time-to-update factors","","","","","","","20170807","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The coordination becomes more challenging when the EV owners have different charging preferences. To tackle this problem, a hybrid centralized-decentralized charging control scheme is designed in this paper which mainly includes three parts, as follows. On the centralized charging side, an offline optimal scheduling approach is first presented, aiming at minimizing the energy cost while satisfying the charging requirements of EVs. To deal with the system dynamics and uncertainties, a model predictive control-based adaptive scheduling strategy is then developed to determine the near optimal EV charging profiles in real time. On the decentralized charging side, the interactions between EVs and the charging system controller is modeled as a leader-follower noncooperative Stackelberg game in which the system controller acts as the leader and the EVs act as followers. The existence of the equilibrium state and its optimality are proved and analyzed. It is shown that by adopting the proposed decentralized charging algorithm, the communication burden between EVs and the system controller is low and that the charging scheme is robust to poor communication channels. Last, we investigate how the size of these two charging groups impacts the system utility and propose an algorithm maximizing the total revenues of the whole system. Simulation results evaluate the performances of the scheme and investigate the parameters' impacts on the system utilities.

However, in the fuzzy setting, game graphs are yet to be addressed, although some practical applications, such as modeling fuzzy systems that interact with their environments, appeal to such models. To fill the gap, in this paper, we propose a fuzzy version of game graphs and focus on the fuzzy game graphs with reachability objectives, which we will refer to as fuzzy reachability games (FRGs). In an FRG, the goal of one player is to maximize her truth value of reaching a given target set, while the other player aims at the opposite. In this framework, we show that FRGs are determined in the sense that for every state, both of the two players have the same value, and there exist optimal memoryless strategies for both players. Moreover, we design algorithms, which achieve polynomial time complexity in the size of the FRG, to compute the values of all states and the optimal memoryless strategies for the players. For a special class of FRGs, we provide an improved algorithm that achieves linear-logarithmic running time to compute the values of states. In addition, several examples are given to illustrate our motivation and the theoretical development.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2016.2593495","Higher School Doctoral Subject Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002858 - China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7517395","Fuzzy automaton;fuzzy logic;fuzzy transition system (FTS);game graph;reachability","Automata;Computational modeling;Computer science;Fuzzy systems;Games;Stochastic processes;Uncertainty","computational complexity;fuzzy set theory;game theory;probability;reachability analysis","FRGs;computer science;formal verification;fuzzy game graphs;fuzzy reachability games;linear-logarithmic running time;optimal memoryless strategies;polynomial time complexity;probabilistic versions;reactive systems;two-player turn-based games","","","","","","","20160720","Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

China","2017 IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)","20170731","2017","","","1","6","Network Function Virtualization (NFV) transforms the traditional service provision architecture into a software-based structure. In NFV, Virtual Network Functions Forwarding Graph (VNF FG) [1] is used to describe the logic connections among the VNFs placed on the Physical Network (PN). And end-to-end services are represented as flows traverse the VNF FG. To improve the reliability of the services, redundancy is proposed as an effective method. Existing redundancy method protects the unreliable VNF for end-to-end service independently and embeds the backup without considering the reliability of the PN hardware. Such a scheme ignores the global information of the VNF FG and leads to an inaccurate reliability estimation for the services. These deficiencies result in over backup and the utilization reduction of the underlying resource. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel redundancy scheme. By using the Cost-aware Importance Measure (CIM), the structure of the VNF FG is involved in selecting the qualified backups. Meanwhile, with CIM, the placement decision is made by mapping these backups to the PN nodes with high reliability. In our simulation, our method performs well for cutting down the backup cost for up to 46% with respect to the present algorithms and keeping high cost-efficiency.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8999-0; POD:978-1-4673-9000-2","10.1109/ICC.2017.7996840","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7996840","Importance Measure;Network Function Virtualization;Redundancy;Reliability","Hardware;Network topology;Redundancy;Reliability engineering;Telecommunication network reliability;Virtualization","computer network reliability;graph theory;telecommunication services;virtualisation","NFV;cost aware importance measure;cost efficient redundancy scheme;forwarding graph;network function virtualization;placement decision;service provision;service reliability;software based structure","","","","","","","","21-25 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As outsourcing is now well established the switching of vendors and transitioning from one system to another is common. However, most of the research to date on outsourcing has focused on the decision and operation phases, leaving a gap between theory and practice concerning the transition phase. Transition in outsourcing entails the changing of systems, business processes and/or vendors. If a suitable transition approach is not applied pressures for another transition can immediately build. This paper presents results from a case study carried out on the 'Novopay Project' in which the Ministry of Education in New Zealand changed their vendor from an onshore to a near-shore provider. This project resulted in a sequence of three transitions, with each following a different approach as a direct result of the experiences encountered in the previous transition. In this research we made use of the rich 'data dump' of evidence provided by the Ministry of Education (MoE). Our analysis describes how a client organization can become trapped in a continuous transition cycle if a suitable approach is not applied. Transition1 involved the client - MoE - moving from complete outsourcing to selective insourcing. After realizing that they did not have the capabilities to manage insourcing, Transition2 was initiated. In Transition2 the sourcing approach reverted back to complete outsourcing. When it was realized that the new vendor in Transition2 could not in fact deliver a new service model or support end-users in following new business processes, Transition3 was initiated. In Transition3, the client established an internal company to insource service operations to support end-users. Transition can be a sound business strategy initiated for a range of reasons. However, if a flawed sourcing approach is chosen it can result in 'continuous transition'.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1587-4; POD:978-1-5386-1588-1","10.1109/ICGSE.2017.6","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7976686","Novopay Project;continuous transition;outsourcing;switching of vendors;transition","Contracts;Data analysis;Organizations;Outsourcing;Software engineering;Switches","business data processing;outsourcing","Ministry of Education;MoE;Novopay Project;business processes;business strategy;continuous transition cycle;data dump;insource service operations;near-shore provider;outsourcing;selective insourcing;service model","","","","","","","","22-23 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the increase in mobile resources, the researchers have taken the initiative to take into contemplation resource sharing among heterogeneous mobile devices. Therefore, to design a system architecture for mobility models and resource sharing are key issues that require utmost efforts to be solved to achieve anticipated objectives. Therefore, keeping in view the desired goals, in this paper, we present a system architecture based on the hierarchical resource sharing mechanism for MCC. The proposed system architecture is divided into three domains, such as Global Cloud Server (GCS), Local ISP Server (LIS), and Gateway Server (GWS). Also, the novel paradigm for minimizing the delay in the network based on deploying Foglets at each proposed algorithm of clustering mechanism is also present. Moreover, the fuzzy rule-based scheme is proposed to eliminate the inappropriate foglets before deciding an optimal foglet for handover. A foglet selection scheme is developed based on the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) decision mechanism. Various parameters such as delay, jitter, Bit Error Rate (BER), packet loss, communication cost, response time, and network load are considered for selecting an optimal network. To check the feasibility and performance of the proposed system architecture, the mobility scenario is considered with a different speed of a mobile node ranging from very high to very low. The simulation results and an analytical model are compared with existing scheme for foglet selection by a mobile node. From the analysis and discussion, it is shown that the proposed system architecture helps in minimizing handover delay, packet loss, average queuing delay, and device lifetime. in a network.","","","10.1109/TSUSC.2017.2714344","Brain Korea 21 Plus project; Ministry of Education, School of Computer Science and Engineering; SW Human Resource Development Program for Supporting Smart Life; 10.13039/501100002531 - Kyungpook National University; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7945497","Mobile cloud computing;and gateway server (GWS);global cloud server (GCS);local ISP server (LIS)","Cloud computing;Education;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Resource management;Servers;Systems architecture","TOPSIS;cloud computing;energy conservation;error statistics;fuzzy set theory;mobile computing;pattern clustering;power aware computing;resource allocation;software architecture","BER;GCS;GWS;LIS;MCC;TOPSIS decision mechanism;bit error rate;clustering mechanism;communication cost;delay minimization;energy efficient hierarchical resource management;foglet selection;fuzzy rule-based scheme;gateway server;global cloud server;heterogeneous mobile devices;hierarchical resource sharing;jitter;local ISP server;mobile cloud computing;mobile resources;mobile services;mobility models;network load;packet loss;system architecture;technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution","","","","","","","20170609","April-June 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Querying these graphs can be modeled as a subgraph matching problem. Since knowledge graphs are incomplete and noisy in nature, it is important to discover answers matching exactly as well as answers similar to queries. Existing graph matching algorithms usually use graph indices to accelerate query processing. For billion-node graphs, it may be infeasible to build the graph indices due to the amount of work and the memory/ storage required. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for finding the best k answers for a given query without precomputing graph indices. An answer's quality is measured by a matching score that is computed online. To accelerate query processing, we propose a novel technique for bounding the matching scores during the computation. By using bounds, the low quality answers can be efficiently pruned. The bounding technique can be implemented in a distributed environment, allowing our approach to efficiently query web-scale knowledge graphs. We evaluate the effectiveness and the efficiency of our approach on real-world datasets. The result shows that our bounding technique can reduce the running time up to two orders of magnitude comparing to an approach without using bounds.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2017.2665478","Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization; Collaborative Innovation Center of Wireless Communications Technology; International S&T Cooperation Program of China; Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Network and Information Security; National Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; 10.13039/100000001 - US National Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7845718","Subgraph similarity matching;billion-node graph;distributed system;index-free;knowledge graph;top-<named-content xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xmlns:ali=""http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/"" xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" content-type=""math"" xlink:type=""simple""> <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$</tex-math> <alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""jin-ieq2-2665478.gif"" xlink:type=""simple""/> </alternatives> </inline-formula> </named-content> query","Acceleration;Avatars;Films;Knowledge engineering;Optimization;Query processing;Resource description framework","Internet;graph theory;knowledge based systems;query processing","billion-node graphs;bounding technique;distributed environment;graph indices;graph matching algorithms;graph querying;matching score;query processing;querying Web-scale knowledge graphs;search space pruning;subgraph matching problem","","","","","","","20170207","Aug. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Software practitioners perceive build automation tools as complex, which can hinder the adoption of these tools. How well founded such perception is, can be determined by systematic exploration of adoption factors that influence usage of build automation tools. The goal of this paper is to aid software practitioners in increasing their usage of build automation tools by identifying the adoption factors that influence usage of these tools. We conducted a survey to empirically identify the adoption factors that influence usage of build automation tools. We obtained survey responses from 268 software professionals who work at NestedApps, Red Hat, as well as contribute to open source software. We observe that adoption factors related to complexity do not have the strongest influence on usage of build automation tools. Instead, we observe compatibility-related adoption factors, such as adjustment with existing tools, and adjustment with practitioner's existing workflow, to have influence on usage of build automation tools with greater importance. Findings from our paper suggest that usage of build automation tools might increase if: build automation tools fit well with practitioners' existing workflow and tool usage, and usage of build automation tools are made more visible among practitioners' peers.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-0428-1; POD:978-1-5386-0429-8","10.1109/RCoSE.2017.8","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7967948","build automation tools;practitioners;survey","Automation;Complexity theory;Education;Software;Software engineering;Systematics;Tools","public domain software;software engineering;software tools","NestedApps;Red Hat;adoption factors;build automation tools;compatibility-related adoption factors;open source software;practitioners usage;software changes;software practitioners;software professionals;systematic exploration","","","","","","","","22-22 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The theories behind these changes is are decades old, but only with the convergence of these factors do we begin to see a shift in centuries old structures of teaching practice, both in industry and academia. In this talk, I will share my experience and that of my peers in teaching and designing curricula in industry and academia, and how our own learnings from the agile community have influenced both content and form in the design of software engineering programs and courses. I will discuss entry-level software engineering programs for large companies and agile/technology training in both industry and computer science programs. I will describe (1) how the organizations to which I belong have faced the challenges of articulating different courses in a university program for innovation, (2) a university-wide cross-functional team of facilitators to help students navigate their way through the curriculum, (3) applications of active learning methodologies in both industry and university, and (4) the deployment of the inverted curriculum throughout a computer engineering program.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2795-2; POD:978-1-5386-2796-9","10.1109/SECM.2017.11","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7964614","agile software development;millennials;software engineering curricula","Companies;Industries;Sociology;Software;Software engineering;Training","computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;organisational aspects;software prototyping;teaching","academia;active learning methodologies;agile community;agile journey;computer engineering program;computer science program;entry-level software engineering programs;industry program;inverted curriculum;software engineering courses;teaching methodologies;teaching practice;ubiquitous information overflow;university program;university-wide cross-functional team","","","","","","","","27-27 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The scope is wide. Students prefer hands-on work over theory. Industry increasingly values soft skills. Changing software technology requires the syllabus to be technology-agnostic, yet abstracting away technology compromises realism. Instructors must balance scope with depth of learning. At Carnegie Mellon University, we designed a flipped-classroom course that tackles these tradeoffs. The course has been offered since Fall 2014 in the Silicon Valley campus. In this paper, we describe the course's key features and summarize our experiences and lessons learned while designing, teaching, and maintaining it. We found that the pure flipped-classroom format was not optimal in ensuring sufficient transfer of knowledge, especially in remote settings. We initially underestimated teaching assistantship resources. We gradually complemented video lectures and hands-on live sessions with additional live components: easily replaceable recitations that focus on current technology and mini lectures that address application of theory and common wisdom. We also provided the students with more opportunities to share their successes and experiments with their peers. We achieved scalability by increasing the number of teaching assistants, paying attention to teaching assistant recruitment, and fostering a culture of mentoring among the teaching team.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2671-9; POD:978-1-5386-2672-6","10.1109/ICSE-SEET.2017.20","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7964326","flipped classroom;inverted instruction;software education curricula;software engineering education","Mentoring;Online services;Silicon;Software;Software engineering;Testing","computer science education;educational courses;software engineering;teaching","flipped-classroom format;graduate-level software engineering foundations course;hands-on live sessions;knowledge transfer;teaching assistant recruitment;teaching assistantship resources;teaching team;video lectures","","","","","","","","20-28 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It provides high bisection bandwidth with low power consumption and low complexity of network wiring. However, it raises new challenges for the flow scheduling problem due to the dynamic arrival of traffic flows with unknown service duration combined with the circuit-switched nature of optical networks and wavelength continuity constraint. While the knowledge of flow service time helps to use resources in a better way to increase the revenue, in practice, the service time cannot be accurately specified. In this paper, we address the problem of flow scheduling in optical data centers considering the above challenges. We first develop an optimization formulation using Markov decision process that can estimate the flow termination time and revenue for cloud providers in a long run under the uncertainty in flow service time. Since solving the optimization formulation is mathematically intractable, we then develop heuristic scheduling algorithms for both scenarios: with known and with unknown flow service time. We use a probabilistic model to address the uncertainty due to unknown flow service time. We design a flow scheduling framework that integrates the proposed algorithms to perform flow scheduling in optical data center networks. We evaluate the proposed algorithms through comprehensive simulations and compare their performance against that of a baseline algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithms achieve significant performance improvement compared with the baseline algorithm.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2716345","NUS WBS; Singapore Ministry of Education, Academic Research Fund Tier 2; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7954968","Markov decision process;Traffic flow scheduling;WDM-based optical networks;optical data centers;software defined networks;uncertainty in flow service time","Algorithm design and analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Optical fiber networks;Optical packet switching;Optical switches;Scheduling;Software algorithms","Markov processes;cloud computing;computer centres;decision theory;optical switches;optimisation;software defined networking;telecommunication power management;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic;uncertain systems;wavelength division multiplexing","Markov decision process;WDM-based optical networks;bisection bandwidth;circuit-switched optical networks;cloud providers;data center performance;dynamic flow scheduling;dynamic traffic flows arrival;flow service time;flow termination time;heuristic scheduling algorithms;low power consumption;network technology;network wiring complexity;optical data center networks;optical switching;optimization formulation;performance improvement;probabilistic model;revenue estimation;uncertain flow duration;wavelength continuity constraint;wavelength division multiplexing","","","","","","OAPA","20170622","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, a new model is developed to predict real time traffic crash risk based on some elaborately selected characteristics of traffic flow. Compared with the dominant conventional matched case-control logistic regression model which is based on the assumption that all the traffic crashes share the same contributing factors and ignores the variability of traffic flow and heterogeneity of crash causations, the latent class logit model can considerably account for the unobserved heterogeneity. Data from Shanghai urban expressway between April to June 2014 are utilized to build the latent class logit model. The collected data are divided into a training set for model building and a validation set for model evaluation by random selection. Some criteria including Akaike information criterion (AIC), area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity are used to evaluate the model quality. The experimental results show that the overall accuracy of the latent class logit model is 70.23% and AUC of the model is 0.7576, which are both higher comparing to the traditional widely used case-control logistic regression model.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5507-4; POD:978-1-5090-5508-1","10.1109/ICIS.2017.7959987","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7959987","latent class logit model;traffic crash risk prediction;unobserved heterogeneity;urban expressway","Accidents;Analytical models;Computer crashes;Data models;Logistics;Predictive models;Roads","forecasting theory;regression analysis;risk management;road accidents;road safety;road traffic","Shanghai urban expressway;latent class logit model;proactive safety management systems;traffic crash risk prediction;traffic flow","","","","","","","","24-26 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

And the number of variable message signs and carriageway area are picked out as features in this study. The combined model not only inherits the accurate trend prediction of ARIMA model, but also calculates comprehensive relevant features. Traffic crash fatalities and fatalities per 10,000 vehicles in Shanghai are selected as targets and two models are trained respectively for the two targets above - ARIMA(1,1,0) and ARIMA(1,2,0).

"Unimodal Stopping Model-Based Early SKIP Mode Decision for High-Efficiency Video Coding","Y. Li; G. Yang; Y. Zhu; X. Ding; X.

For each CU, an exhaustive mode decision strategy is adopted to achieve the best rate distortion (RD) cost, which simultaneously results in enormous computational complexity. In this paper, an early SKIP mode decision algorithm is proposed for the HEVC encoder to speed up the process of mode decision. Each CU size is categorized into either rare used or frequent used by exploiting the correlation of CU depth, which is estimated from the temporally colocated CUs. For the rare-used CU size, the SKIP mode is directly selected as the optimal mode and the remaining mode decision process is early terminated. For the frequent-used CU size, a unimodal stopping model is designed for its early SKIP mode decision by exploiting both hierarchical mode structure and RD cost property. Experimental results show that the proposed early SKIP mode decision method achieves average 58.5% and 54.8% encoding time savings, while the Bjontegaard Delta bit rate only increases average 0.8% and 0.8% for various test sequences under the random access and the low delay B conditions, respectively.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2017.2669863","Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center on Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higer Education Institutions; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7857045","High efficiency video coding (HEVC);SKIP mode;mode decision;unimodal stopping model (USM)","Computational complexity;Copper;Correlation;Encoding;High efficiency video coding;Video sequences","computational complexity;rate distortion theory;video coding","Bjontegaard Delta bit rate;HEVC encoder;computational complexity;early SKIP mode decision;hierarchical coding structures;high-efficiency video coding;rate distortion cost;unimodal stopping model","","","","","","","20170215","July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In consequence, learning outcomes should be measured in terms of these intended competencies as well. This holds for large-scale investigations like PISA as well as for the very small scale that is represented by the examinations that a single teaching person performs with his/her students. Yet, to assure validity, competency measurement requires proper models for competency structure and levels, which are based on empirical research. The goal of this project is to identify a set of relevant competencies in the domain of object-oriented programming (OOP), to develop a suitable competency model to represent their structure and to construct proper corresponding test instruments. This paper describes a study on the outcomes of several assignments that represents one step of this process with focus on the subdomain of data structures. The data were collected during an introductory lecture on programming in the winter term 2015/16. We analyzed the student solutions of three mini-projects that deal with the implementation of abstract data, applying a specific e-assessment system to score the students' solutions. To find suitable item sets that could be used for the definition and measurement of certain competencies, different methodologies were applied that are based on classical test theory as well as on contemporary Item Response Analysis. Up to now, several suitable item sets for the competencies were identified, which are required to implement and operate 1- and 2-dim arrays, linked lists, and binary trees.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5467-1; POD:978-1-5090-5468-8; USB:978-1-5090-5466-4","10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7942896","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7942896","Algorithms & data structures;Item Response Theory;Rasch Model;competency models;introductory programming","Analytical models;Conferences;Data models;Data structures;Engineering education;Programming;Stochastic processes","computer science education;data structures;educational administrative data processing;object-oriented programming","OOP;abstract data;algorithms;competency based testing;data structures;e-assessment system;introductory programming lecture;item response analysis;object-oriented programming","","","","","","","","25-28 April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our society, it is well recognized that developing students' statistics thinking at all levels of education, is of great importance and has a significant objective in later development [l]l-2[2]. Over the last decade several main reasons contributed to the effective use in professional training and learning contexts and they are based on: action rather than explanations; active involving students in problem solving; facilitating numerous learning styles and fostering decision making [3]. Within such a context, games and simulations are seen as a vital complement to traditional learning process and a primary driver in transformation of education. According to our literature review on this topic, the impact of educational games and interactive educational software on learning statistics has been augmented the last years. The main emphasis of this paper is given on certain issues of literature review of the educational games and especially on their relation to statistics curriculum and also on their support on teaching statistics to students.

Specifically, we propose a two-phase framework called crowddeliver for the package delivery path planning. In the first phase, we mine the historical taxi trajectory data offline to identify the shortest package delivery paths with estimated travel time given any Origin-Destination pairs. Using the paths and travel time as the reference, in the second phase we develop an online adaptive taxi scheduling algorithm to find the near-optimal delivery paths iteratively upon real-time requests and direct the package routing accordingly. Finally, we evaluate the two-phase framework using the real-world data sets, which consist of a point of interest, a road network, and the large-scale trajectory data, respectively, that are generated by 7614 taxis in a month in the city of Hangzhou, China.

During this process, reliable predictions for quality of service (QoS) based on historical service invocations are vital to users. This work aims at making highly accurate predictions for missing QoS data via building an ensemble of nonnegative latent factor (NLF) models. Its motivations are: 1) the fulfillment of nonnegativity constraints can better represent the positive value nature of QoS data, thereby boosting the prediction accuracy and 2) since QoS prediction is a learning task, it is promising to further improve the prediction accuracy with a carefully designed ensemble model. To achieve this, we first implement an NLF model for QoS prediction. This model is then diversified through feature sampling and randomness injection to form a diversified NLF model, based on which an ensemble is built. Comparison results between the proposed ensemble and several widely employed and state-of-the-art QoS predictors on two large, real data sets demonstrate that the former can outperform the latter well in terms of prediction accuracy.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2412037","Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China; NSFC; Post-Doctoral Science Funded Project of Chongqing; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; U.S. NSF; Young Scientist Foundation of Chongqing; 10.13039/501100002858 - China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7091940","Collaborative filtering;QoS prediction;Web-service selection;Web-service selection.;ensemble;latent factor","Accuracy;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Data models;Predictive models;Quality of service;Training","Web services;quality of service","QoS prediction;automatic Web-service selection;diversified NLF model;feature sampling;historical service invocations;learning task;missing QoS data;nonnegative latent factor model;nonnegativity constraints;prediction accuracy;quality of service;randomness injection;service computing","","10","","48","","","20150422","March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, it is also called big social networking services. In order to motivate users of online social networks to share information and communicate with each other frequently, we first analyzed the activity statuses of users in one of famous social networks, Weibo, and then proposed a lurker game model for accumulating big data. In addition to the features of the public goods game, this model also introduces the factor of individual incentive depending on his degree. We found that the individual strategy to be chosen was not relevant to the user's degree, but to an incentive constant of the entire network. The simulation results showed that individual strategies asymptotically followed three different behaviors according to the dynamic organization of the individuals. Active users will emerge during the evolutionary process with an incentive. Without an incentive, active central users can hardly affect the states of their neighbors and may even become lurkers due to the large number of lurking neighbors. Large noise decreases the influence of the high incentive and causes the chaos of networks. If the continuous chaos exists, active users will gradually lose interest and leave the network.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2626079","Key Scientific Research Fund of Sichuan Education Department; Shaanxi Department of Science and Technology; 10.13039/100010144 - Scientific Research Foundation of Chengdu University of Information Technology; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7736998","Social network;big data analytics;common goods game;complex network;evolutionary game","Analytical models;Big data;Chaos theory;Complex networks;Computer science;Games;Social network services","Big Data;evolutionary computation;game theory;social networking (online)","Big Data;Weibo;activity dilemmas;big social networks;evolutionary process;incentive constant;lurker game model;online social networks;social networking services","","","","","","OAPA","20161107","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The web-delivered services can be modeled as mashup components, while the development of mashup actually yields a set of inter-connected mashup components. The growing popularity of mashup components enriches functionality and user experiences, while the possible connections among components are complex and difficult to mashup developers, who might be non-professional programmers or even end-users, as actions over one component may have potential impacts on another. This paper proposes a novel approach for recommending developers in terms of navigation and completion of mashup components with a large-scale components repository. From data-driven perspective, we model the relationships between mashup components by a generic layered-graph model. Developers are allowed to select some initial components as starting point, while a graph-based algorithm recommends how to navigate to potentially relevant mashup components and complete the relevant mashup application.

However, current NMF-based CF recommenders suffer from the problem of high computational and storage complexity, as well as slow convergence rate, which prevents them from industrial usage in context of big data. To address these issues, this paper proposes an alternating direction method (ADM)-based nonnegative latent factor (ANLF) model. The main idea is to implement the ADM-based optimization with regard to each single feature, to obtain high convergence rate as well as low complexity. Both computational and storage costs of ANLF are linear with the size of given data in the target matrix, which ensures high efficiency when dealing with extremely sparse matrices usually seen in CF problems. As demonstrated by the experiments on large, real data sets, ANLF also ensures fast convergence and high prediction accuracy, as well as the maintenance of nonnegativity constraints.

A novel automatic software testing method based on system design specifications is proposed to improve the smart TV software testing efficiency. First, the behavior of the smart TV is modeled, based on the system design specification with hierarchical state transition matrixes (HSTMs). The scale of the state model of the smart TV is lowered by setting the group state according to the choice of the key nodes based on the importance of the nodes in the network; then, the HSTM model is converted into an expanded regular expression (ERE) with the memory property. Second, every closure operator in the ERE is replaced recursively with a certain integral value, according to the cyclomatic complexity of an ERE in the closure to generate a simplified ERE. Then, a test case is generated from the simplified ERE. Finally, the test cases are converted into python script, and a test platform is designed to send the python script to the Android smart TV automatically through its android debug bridge interface. The practical application shows that the test period is shortened, and comparing with the traditional manual test methods, more errors can be tested.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2694880","10.13039/501100001809 - National Nature Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7903600","Cyclomatic complexity;Hierarchical state transition matrix;expanded regular expressions;group state","Androids;Complexity theory;Humanoid robots;Smart homes;Software;TV;Testing","Android (operating system);digital television;matrix algebra;program testing","Android smart TV;ERE;HSTM;automatic software testing method;cyclomatic complexity;expanded regular expression;hierarchical state transition matrix","","","","","","OAPA","20170418","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Enhancing image resolution is desired but has been very challenging in medical image processing. Super resolution reconstruction based on sparse representation and overcomplete dictionary has been lately employed to address this problem; however, these methods require extra training sets, which may not be always available. This paper proposes a novel single anisotropic 3-D MR image upsampling method via sparse representation and overcomplete dictionary that is trained from in-plane high resolution slices to upsample in the out-of-plane dimensions. The proposed method, therefore, does not require extra training sets. Abundant experiments, conducted on simulated and clinical brain MR images, show that the proposed method is more accurate than classical interpolation. When compared to a recent upsampling method based on the nonlocal means approach, the proposed method did not show improved results at low upsampling factors with simulated images, but generated comparable results with much better computational efficiency in clinical cases. Therefore, the proposed approach can be efficiently implemented and routinely used to upsample MR images in the out-of-planes views for radiologic assessment and postacquisition processing.","2168-2194;21682194","","10.1109/JBHI.2015.2470682","Chongqing graduate education reformation research project; Scientific and Technological Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission; 10.13039/100000002 - National Institutes of Health; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7214208","Magnetic resonance imaging;overcomplete dictionary;sparse representation;super resolution reconstruction","Dictionaries;Image reconstruction;Image resolution;Interpolation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Three-dimensional displays","biomedical MRI;brain;image reconstruction;image representation;image resolution;image sampling;medical image processing","clinical brain MR images;in-plane high resolution slices;medical image processing;out-of-plane dimensions;overcomplete dictionary;postacquisition processing;radiologic assessment;single anisotropic 3D MR image upsampling;sparse representation;superresolution reconstruction","","1","","","","","20150820","Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Different from traditional complexity measures that mainly focus on surface features like the numbers of syllables per word, characters per word, or words per sentence, ACT draws from the perspective of human concept learning, which can reflect the complex semantic relations inside texts. To cope with the high cost of measuring ACT, the Degree-2 Hypothesis of ACT is proposed to reduce the measurement from unrestricted dimensions to three dimensions. Based on the principle of “mental anchor,” an extension of ACT and its general edition [denoted as extension of text algebraic complexity (EACT) and general extension of text algebraic complexity (GEACT)] are developed, which take keywords' and association rules' complexities into account. Finally, using the scores given by humans as a benchmark, we compare our proposed methods with linguistic models. The experimental results show the order GEACT>EACT>ACT> Linguistic models, which means GEACT performs the best, while linguistic models perform the worst. Additionally, GEACT with lower convex functions has the best ability in measuring the algebraic complexities of text understanding. It may also indicate that the human complexity curve tends to be a curve like lower convex function rather than linear functions.","2168-2291;21682291","","10.1109/THMS.2014.2329874","City University of Hong Kong; Key Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission; 100000001 - National Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6879296","Cognitive informatics;text understanding;web search","Association rules;Complexity theory;Diseases;Educational institutions;Heart;Pragmatics;Semantics","algebra;computational linguistics;data mining;text analysis","GEACT;association rules;complex semantic relation;convex function;degree-2 hypothesis;general extension of ACT;human concept learning;linguistic model;text algebraic complexity;text understanding","","1","","48","","","20140815","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose an output constraint transfer (OCT) method that by modeling the distribution of correlation response in a Bayesian optimization framework is able to mitigate the drifting problem. OCT builds upon the reasonable assumption that the correlation response to the target image follows a Gaussian distribution, which we exploit to select training samples and reduce model uncertainty. OCT is rooted in a new theory which transfers data distribution to a constraint of the optimized variable, leading to an efficient framework to calculate correlation filters. Extensive experiments on a commonly used tracking benchmark show that the proposed method significantly improves KCF, and achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art trackers.

Starting with an empty object database, we incrementally build up object models while at the same time using these models to identify newly observed object views. In the proposed framework, objects are modeled as view graphs and a probabilistic observation model is presented. Both the appearance and the spatial structure of the object are examined, and a formulation based on maximum likelihood estimation is developed. Joint object recognition and modeling are achieved by solving the optimization problem. To evaluate the framework, we have developed a method for simultaneously learning multiple 3-D object models directly from the cluttered indoor environment and tested it using several everyday scenes.

In this paper, we exploit software-defined networking technology to significantly extend the flexibility and programmability for pseudonym management in vehicular clouds. We propose a software-defined pseudonym system, where the distributed pseudonym pools are promptly scheduled and elastically managed in a hierarchical manner. In order to decrease the system overhead due to the cost of inter-pool communications, we leverage the two-sided matching theory to formulate and solve the pseudonym resource scheduling.

We model collaboration within this framework as a decision-making problem in which agents have to determine what capabilities to learn and from which agents to learn them so that they can form teams that have the capabilities required to perform the current tasks satisfactorily. Our proposed technique refers to principles from human learning theory to enable an agent to strategically select appropriate capabilities to learn from other agents. We also use two openness parameters to model the dynamic nature of tasks and agents in the environment. Experimental results within the Repast agent simulator show that by using the appropriate learning strategy, the overall utility of the agents improves considerably. The performance of the agents and their utilities are also dependent on the repetitiveness of tasks and reencounter with agents within the environment.

Although topic models have proved to be very successful in discovering latent topics, the standard topic models cannot be directly applied to graph-structured data due to the “bag-of-word” assumption. In this paper, an innovative graph topic model (GTM) is proposed to address this issue, which uses Bernoulli distributions to model the edges between nodes in a graph. It can, therefore, make the edges in a graph contribute to latent topic discovery and further improve the accuracy of the supervised and unsupervised learning of graphs.

Therefore, it is essential to design a controllable target range for testing and evaluating the attack impact. In this paper, we construct an attack test platform in order to evaluate the attack impact from different attack tools or the combinations of these attack tools. According to “vulnerability-asset-service-mission” (VASM) relationship, we design a multilayered evaluation model VASM, which includes a four-layer information structure: vulnerability layer, asset layer, service layer, and mission layer, from bottom to top. Considering that each asset may have one or more vulnerabilities, we score the attack impact on each asset based on attack probability and vulnerability and calculate the operational capacity of an asset after an attack. Since services may be provided jointly by one or more assets, we calculate the attack impact on services utilizing the dependencies among assets.

Nevertheless, with the increasing adoption and presence of Web services, it becomes more difficult to find the most appropriate Web service that satisfies both users' functional and nonfunctional requirements. In this paper, we propose an effective Web service ranking approach based on collaborative filtering (CF) by exploring the user behavior, in which the invocation and query history are used to infer the potential user behavior. CF-based user similarity is calculated through similar invocations and similar queries (including functional query and QoS query) between users. Three aspects of Web services-functional relevance, CF based score, and QoS utility, are all considered for the final Web service ranking. To avoid the impact of different units, range, and distribution of variables, three ranks are calculated for the three factors respectively. The final Web service ranking is obtained by using a rank aggregation method based on rank positions. We also propose effective evaluation metrics to evaluate our approach. Large-scale experiments are conducted based on a real world Web service dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing approach on the rank performance.","1932-4537;19324537","","10.1109/TNSM.2015.2499265","Scientific Research Fund of Hunan Provincial Education Department of China; State Key Laboratory of Software Engineering (SKLSE) of China; 10.13039/501100001602 - Science Foundation Ireland; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7322284","QoS utility;Web service;collaborative filtering;functional relevance;service ranking;user behavior","Behavioral science;Collaboration;Communication system operations and management;Filtering theory;Quality of service;Ranking (statistics);User centered design;Web services","Web services;behavioural sciences;collaborative filtering;query processing;social aspects of automation","CF based score;CF-based user similarity;QoS query;QoS utility;Web service ranking method;collaborative filtering;evaluation metrics;functional query;functional relevance;invocation;nonfunctional requirements;query history;rank aggregation method;service-oriented computing;user behavior;users functional requirements","","","","32","","","20151109","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the scale and highly dynamic nature of cloud application imposes significant new challenges to resource management, and efficient resource scheduling schemes are highly demanded. In this paper, we propose a systematic method to address the reliability, running time, and failure processing of resource scheduling in cloud computing. A reflection mechanism is used to abstract the resource scheduling process as a metaobject. Petri nets are used to construct the base layer model, meta layer model, metaobject protocol, and other components, thus forming the resource scheduling model. The adaptive resource scheduling strategy is converted into CTL formulas, and the properties are analyzed. Meanwhile, an enforcement algorithm is proposed, which can guarantee the correct behavior of cloud computing while meeting the required reliability within deadline constraints. The operational semantics and related theories of Petri nets help prove its effectiveness and correctness. We have also performed a series of simulations to evaluate our approach. Results show that it can help reveal the structural and behavioral characteristics of cloud computing and improve the efficiency of resource management.","1932-4537;19324537","","10.1109/TNSM.2016.2553157","NSF of China; Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7451257","CTL;Cloud computing;Petri nets;reflection mechanism;resource scheduling","Adaptation models;Adaptive scheduling;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Processor scheduling;Virtual machining","Petri nets;aspect-oriented programming;cloud computing;resource allocation;scheduling;software reliability","Petri net;aspect-oriented method;cloud computing;deadline constraint;enforcement algorithm;reflection mechanism;resource scheduling;system reliability;systematic method","","1","","32","","","20160412","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Moreover, spatial information, enforcing the assumption that the adjacent pixels belong to the same class with a high probability, is a valuable complement to the spectral information. In this paper, two predominant approaches have been developed to exploit the spatial information. First, by decomposing each pixel and the spatial neighborhood into a low-rank form, the spatial information can be efficiently integrated into the spectral signatures. Meanwhile, in order to describe the low-rank structure of the decomposed data more precisely, an ℓ<sub>1/2</sub> norm regularization is introduced and a discrete algorithm is proposed to solve the combined optimization problem by the augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM) and a half-threshold operator. Second, a graph cuts segmentation algorithm has been applied on the sparse-representation-based probability estimates of the hyperspectral data to further improve the spatial homogeneity of the material distribution. Experimental results on four real hyperspectral data with different spectral and spatial resolutions have demonstrated the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed spatial information-fused approaches for hyperspectral image classification.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2423278","Guangdong Foundation of Outstanding Young Teachers in Higher Education Institutions; Shenzhen Dedicated Funding of Strategic Emerging Industry Development Program; Shenzhen Scientific Research and Development Funding Program; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163293","Augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM);hyperspectral image classification;low-rank representation (LRR);nuclear norm","Feature extraction;Hyperspectral imaging;Matrix decomposition;Minimization;Optimization;Training","graph theory;hyperspectral imaging;image classification;image representation;image segmentation;optimisation;statistical analysis","ALM;augmented Lagrange multiplier;combined optimization problem;discrete algorithm;graph cuts segmentation algorithm;half-threshold operator;hyperspectral sensor;l<sub>1/2</sub> norm regularization;low-rank representation;pixel decomposition;sparse representation-based graph cuts;sparse-representation-based probability estimation;spatial homogeneity;spatial information;spatial neighborhood;spectral bands;spectral information;spectral signatures;spectral-spatial hyperspectral image classification","","17","","57","","","20150720","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents an interference resistant approach for IWSNs by utilizing cognitive radio techniques. To improve the interference detection performance while uploading data as little as possible, we present a new computationally efficient and effective belief function (BF) theory-based reliability-probability decision fusion rule for cooperative sensing. A factor called reliability degree is introduced to characterize the imprecision of sensor observations, and the basic belief assignments are constructed by combining this reliability degree and local detection performance. Unlike the inefficient existing BF-based fusion schemes, the proposed rule has an explicit form and it is equivalent to the well-known Chair-Vashney (CV) rule in high signal-to-noise ratio conditions. We applied the proposed rule in interference resistant IWSNs to detect and avoid interference. Both numerical results and tests results demonstrate that the proposed rule has significant improvement in detection performance, diversity gains, and throughput compared with existing BF fusion schemes and CV rule.","1551-3203;15513203","","10.1109/TII.2016.2558464","Academic Discipline and Post-Graduate Education Project of the Beijing Municipal Commission of Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7460250","Belief function (BF);cooperative sensing;decision fusion;interference resistant;target detection","Interference;Protocols;Reliability;Resistance;Sensors;Signal to noise ratio;Wireless sensor networks","cognitive radio;cooperative communication;object detection;sensor fusion;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;wireless sensor networks","CV;Chair-Vashney;IWSNs;belief function-based cooperative sensing;cognitive radio;communication reliability;high signal-to-noise ratio;industrial wireless sensor networks;interference detection performance;local detection performance;reliability degree;sensor observations;target detection","","","","","","","20160427","Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The requirement does not hold for black-box systems whose source code and logical model are not accessible. To apply SCT to black-box systems, we integrate automaton learning technology with SCT and apply the new method to improve the requirements conformance of software reuse. If the reused software component does not satisfy a requirement, the method adds a supervisor component to prevent the black-box system from reaching 'faulty sections.' The method employs learning-based testing (LBT) to verify whether the reused software meets all requirements in the new context. LBT generates a large number of test cases and iteratively constructs an automaton model of the system under test. If the system fails the test, the learned model is applied as the plant model for control synthesis using SCT. Then, the supervisor is implemented as an executable program to monitor and control the system to follow the requirement. Finally, the integrated system, including the supervisory program and the reused component, is tested by LBT to assure the satisfiability of the requirement. This paper makes two contributions. First, we innovatively integrate LBT and SCT for the control synthesis of black-box reactive systems.

Standards are needed to enable cooperation while promoting competition. Within the framework of a standard, the companies involved in the standardization process contribute and agree on appropriate technical specifications to ensure diversity and compatibility, and facilitate worldwide commercial deployment and evolution. Those parts of the system that can create competitive advantages are intentionally left open in the specifications. Such specifications are extensive, complex, and minimalistic. This makes telecommunication standards education a difficult endeavor, but it is much demanded by industry and governments to spur economic growth. This article describes a methodology for teaching wireless communications standards. We define our methodology around six learning stages that assimilate the standardization process and identify key learning objectives for each. Enabled by software-defined radio technology, we describe a practical learning environment that facilitates developing many of the needed technical and soft skills without the inherent difficulty and cost associated with radio frequency components and regulation. Using only open source software and commercial of-the-shelf computers, this environment is portable and can easily be recreated at other educational institutions and adapted to their educational needs and constraints.

Digital signature is a widely used technique to protect messages' authenticity and nodes' identities. From the practical perspective, to ensure the quality of services in wireless mobile networks, ideally the process of signature verification should introduce minimum delay. Batch cryptography technique is a powerful tool to reduce verification time. However, most of the existing works focus on designing batch verification algorithms for wireless mobile networks without sufficiently considering the impact of invalid signatures, which can lead to verification failures and performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a Batch Identification Game Model (BIGM) in wireless mobile networks, enabling nodes to find invalid signatures with reasonable delay no matter whether the game scenario is complete information or incomplete information. Specifically, we analyze and prove the existence of Nash Equilibriums (NEs) in both scenarios, to select the dominant algorithm for identifying invalid signatures. To optimize the identification algorithm selection, we propose a self-adaptive auto-match protocol which estimates the strategies and states of attackers based on historical information. Comprehensive simulation results in terms of NE reasonability, algorithm selection accuracy, and identification delay are provided to demonstrate that BIGM can identify invalid signatures more efficiently than existing algorithms.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2016.2604820","Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University, Riyadh; Key Laboratory of Aerospace Information Security and Trusted Computing; Major State Basic Research Development Program of China; National High Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China; 10.13039/100000001 - US National Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7556995","Batch identification;game theory;wireless mobile networks","Algorithm design and analysis;Communication system security;Delays;Games;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Wireless communication","cryptography;digital signatures;game theory;mobile radio;quality of service;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","BIGM;NE reasonability;Nash equilibriums;algorithm selection accuracy;batch cryptography technique;batch identification game model;batch verification algorithm;digital signature;identification algorithm selection;identification delay;message authenticity protection;node identity;quality of services;self-adaptive auto-match protocol;signature verification;wireless mobile networks","","1","","","","","20160831","June 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Beginning with simple Arduino-based robot kits, students in the middle and high school levels are introduced to programming and robotics using an easy to follow curriculum. As they advance, students can remotely access the Mars Yard and perform pre-determined missions on real or simulated rovers.

While existing studies mainly focused on developing theories to explain the cause of return reversal, we aim at predicting return reversal by proposing a two-stage method in this paper. In the first stage, we employ dynamical Bayesian factor graph (DBFG) to select key factors correlating with return reversal closely from a comprehensive set of economic factors. In the second stage, we input the key factors into artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM) and hidden Markov model (HMM) respectively, to accomplish the prediction of return reversal. Through extensive experiments on the US stock market, we establish that the key factors influencing return reversal generally change from year to year, yet factors related to the economic theory of liquidity effect consistently emerge as part of the key factors.

A parameterized unit test (PUT) is simply a test method that takes parameters, calls the code under test, and states assertions. Parameterized unit testing allows the separation of two testing concerns or tasks: the specification of external, black-box behavior (i.e., assertions or specifications) by developers and the generation and selection of internal, white-box test inputs (i.e., high-code-covering test inputs) by tools. PUTs have been supported by various testing frameworks. Various open source and industrial testing tools also exist to generate test inputs for PUTs. This technical briefing presents latest research on principles and techniques, as well as practical considerations to apply parameterized unit testing on real-world programs, highlighting success stories, research and education achievements, and future research directions in developer testing.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-4205-6; POD:978-1-5090-2245-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7883437","Parameterized Unit Testing;Test Generation;Test Oracles","Education;Industries;Software;Software engineering;Software testing;Writing","formal specification;program testing;software tools","PUT;black-box behavior specification;code testing;developer testing;industrial testing tools;open source testing tools;parameterized unit testing;white-box test input generation;white-box test input selection","","","","","","","","14-22 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Herein, we use the five factor and stress theory to measure personal characteristics and classify students enrolled in a PBL class at Waseda University into four types-leadership, management, tugboat, and anchor. Then, knowledge and skills questionnaires are used to measure educational effectiveness. The results show that educational effectiveness is highest when a team consists of management and anchor types without leadership types. The results are preliminary, because the practical usefulness of our results is limited as the experiment of the paper targeted only one PBL course of one university.

Despite this emphasis, continual published reports document that engineering graduates are not well versed in the areas of written and oral communication when they graduate and transition into industrial-based positions. This study focuses on examining whether game-based pedagogy could serve as a potential tool for enhancing the written and oral communication skills of engineering undergraduates. Research questions: (1) What is the relationship between communication game exposure and oral and written communication skills achievement in engineering students? (2) Do engineering students' perceptions of their oral and written communication skills development associated with participation in communication games align with their achievement in these areas? Literature review: This study examines the ability of games to enhance engineering student communication skills by using the lens of activity theory. This communication theory was chosen because it describes how the creation of a piece of communication goes beyond traditional features such as grammar and syntax to include grappling with the objective or goal of the work, the system within which the product must be completed, and the methods selected to subdivide the work. These same constraints were imposed on the students within this study, in which they were assigned a technical design report and infomercial (or elevator pitch) to assess their oral and written communication skills. Methodology: Three groups of a sophomore-level Introduction to Chemical Product Design course compared non-games, games, and games-plus instructional methods. Student design reports and infomercials were scored by two analysts using reliable and validated rubrics. Team-based performance scores for each of the three sections were compared to determine whether any resulting differences in c- mmunication achievement were associated with the incorporation of game-based activities within the classroom. Students' perceptions of their communication skill development were measured through survey instruments and focus groups. The focus group data were content-analyzed by the same two analysts using a coding scheme developed from an emergent qualitative analysis of the focus group data. Results and conclusion: We found that the use of game-based pedagogy within engineering classes can enhance oral and written communication skills even though this method of instruction is not always perceived by students as relevant to their achievement in these areas.","0361-1434;03611434","","10.1109/TPC.2016.2632838","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7817740","Engineering education;games;oral communication;pedagogy;written communication","Bibliographies;Engineering students;Games;Oral communication;Software","computer aided instruction;computer games;educational courses;engineering computing;engineering education","activity theory;communication theory;elevator pitch;engineering communication skills enhancement;engineering curriculum;focus group data;game method;game-based activities;game-based learning;game-based pedagogy;games-plus instructional method;grammar;nongame method;oral communication skills;qualitative analysis;sophomore-level Introduction-to-Chemical Product Design course;student perceptions;syntax;team-based performance scores;written communication skills","","","","","","","20170116","March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This is because packets missing their deadlines would become useless and are frequently dropped, which seriously degrade the quality of service (QoS). As the utilization of Internet of Things has become mature, multimedia data transmission is a key component to promote the QoS of citizens. To fulfill the QoS requirement in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with multimedia content, the combination of multiple transmission methods is encouraged for packet forwarding, including conventional network coding, analog network coding, plain routing, and direct transmission (i.e., no-relaying, NR). The diversity of transmission method is helpful to lower packet dropping probability, while complicating the packet transmitting and scheduling process instead. Therefore, we first introduce an exhaustive search method to obtain the optimal scheduling sequence and corresponding transmission method for deadline constrained multimedia transmissions in WSNs. With the objective of promoting computing efficiency for the formulated problem, we then propose two heuristic methods based on the Markov chain approximation and the dynamic graph, respectively. Simulation results illustrate that our methods can effectively reduce packet dropping probability and simulation time, so that QoS of individuals can be promoted.","1530-437X;1530437X","","10.1109/JSEN.2016.2645709","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Liaoning Province Doctor Startup Fund; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002858 - China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation Project; 10.13039/501100008048 - State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology within the Nanjing University; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7801019","QoS;adaptive transmission;packet dropping;scheduling","Delays;Multimedia communication;Quality of service;Scheduling;Sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Markov processes;diversity reception;graph theory;multimedia communication;quality of service;search problems;telecommunication scheduling;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;Markov chain approximation;QoS;analog network coding;deadline constrained packet scheduling;dynamic graph;exhaustive search method;heuristic methods;high efficiency resource allocation;multimedia data transmission;optimal scheduling sequence;packet forwarding;packet transmission;plain routing;quality of service;transmission method diversity;wireless multimedia sensor networks;wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","20161228","March1, 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As many of the developing countries are involved in construction of smart cities, there arises a need to educate current generation engineers to get knowledge of IoT. To cater this, an open elective IoT has been introduced at eighth semester by Computer Science & Engineering Under Graduate (UG) program for circuit branch students. This paper discusses the challenges and experiences of introducing IoT as an open elective course. The lirst challenge in offering this course is identifying the content of the course, at what level the course needs to be introduced, since both hardware and software components are involved in IoT. Second challenge is involving students in learning process as it is not only theory based and different knowledge level students are part of this course. To address these challenges we followed activity based approach for teaching and learning this course. Various real-world problems are identilied, and assigned to different teams consisting of four students. Outcome based evaluation is followed to assess the group activity. The author's observations indicate that the activity based learning addresses graduate attributes of UG program, such as Design/Development of solutions, Modern tool usage, Engineer and society and Life-long learning.

As an example, material scientists often capture their knowledge in the form of simulation software that contains sophisticated algorithms representing complex physical concepts. Since software engineering is typically not a core skill of these scientists, there is a risk that their software becomes unmaintainable once it reaches a substantial size or structural complexity. This paper reports on a case study in which software engineers consulted magnetics researchers in refactoring their simulation software.

The future of this technology lies in the ability to adapt to numerous inputs that are able to deliver as many different outputs as possible. An industrial robot with the ability to play a game of chess, against itself or a human player, exhibits many of the requirements needed for future reconfigurable assemble systems.

This approach poses the problem of grading and evaluating practical project work as well as process conformance during development. Yet, few best practices exist for measuring the success of students in implementing agile practices. Most university courses rely on observations during the course or final oral exams. In this paper, we propose a set of metrics which give insights into the adherence to agile practices in teams. The metrics identify instances in development data, e.g. commits or user stories, where agile processes were not followed. The identified violations can serve as starting points for further investigation and team discussions. With contextual knowledge of the violation, the executed process or the metric itself can be refined. The metrics reflect our experiences with running a software engineering course over the last five years. They measure aspects which students frequently have issues with and that diminish process adoption and student engagement. We present the proposed metrics, which were tested in the latest course installment, alongside tutoring, lectures, and oral exams.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1790-4; POD:978-1-5090-1791-1","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757684","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757684","Assessment tools;Capstone projects;Computer engineering;Higher education;Metrics","Best practices;Complexity theory;Context;Education;Measurement;Software;Software engineering","computer science education;educational courses;software metrics;software prototyping;teaching","agile metrics;agile software development teaching;oral exams;university courses;university software engineering course","","","","","","","","12-15 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present the results of the analysis of the open-ended questions at the end of the survey. The students were asked to identify a concept that they found particularly difficult and to tell us why. They were also asked to describe how they achieved success in learning a concept that they initially found difficult. We developed a system of thematic codes using a grounded theory approach on a sampling of the data, which we then applied to the entire data set. We uncovered patterns and trends in the student responses. During our analysis, we have uncovered that students are expressing blame for the lack of learning on themselves and instructors, pointing to perceived failures in the classroom environment and course structure, and are showing evidence of the understanding of the learning process.

While there are guidelines for identifying the best teaching style for material, new and evolving areas can present unique challenges. The emerging area of mobile software development, which combines aspects of software, hardware, and interpersonal interaction, captures many such challenges; e.g., understanding how to develop for multiple screen sizes, designing for GPS time lag, dealing with unreliable sensor data. Teaching these challenging materials seemed well suited for multiple approaches that leveraged different learning styles. This paper examines three teaching approaches employed in ten teaching modules across two semesters of a mobile software development course. The approaches included lectures, interactive tutorials, and Pair Programming. Lectures were used to introduce topics and explore underlying theories of development. The lectures included time for questions from and for the students, but otherwise did not have an active learning component. Two active learning approaches used in the class were interactive tutorials and Pair Programming. Interactive tutorials presented applied development approaches, then explored their use in an individual-based hands-on demos. Pair Programming is an agile software development practice, used in both industry and education, which enforces a role-based approach to learning new programming concepts. Homeworks were used to assess learning, and surveys reflected student satisfaction. Results show areas of promise and of concern with regard to the learning styles. It seems that repetition of topics is important for mastery of the topics. Foundational theories seem well suited for lectures, while programming concepts work better in active learning situations. Additional learning took place through office hours, online question forums, and individual and group online explora- ion. The findings suggest specific approaches to teaching challenging and unique mobile software development topics as well as a general approach to identifying ways to distribute learning objectives across lectures, interactive tutorials, and Pair Programming sessions.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1790-4; POD:978-1-5090-1791-1","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757533","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757533","Computer Science Education;Mobile Application Development;Pair Programming","Mobile communication;Programming profession;Software;Springs;Tutorials","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;mobile computing;software engineering;teaching","GPS time lag;active learning component;active learning situations;agile software development practice;distribute learning objectives;group online exploration;hardware;homeworks;individual-based hands-on demos;interactive tutorials;interpersonal interaction;learning process;learning styles;lectures;mobile software development course;mobile software development topics;online question forums;pair programming sessions;programming concepts;student satisfaction;teaching mobile application development;teaching modules;teaching styles;unreliable sensor data","","","","","","","","12-15 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems are increasingly connected with both private and public networks, making them susceptible to disruption or destruction by adversaries anywhere in the world. Attacks such as the Stuxnet worm have highlighted CPS vulnerabilities and motivated the development of CPS-specific defenses. The lab modules described in this paper arose from a project initially focused on technology to counter a Stuxnet-class attack on a CPS, and the suitability of this technology's commercial off-the-shelf components for undergraduate education was later realized. CPS security is not given much attention in undergraduate programs because networks and control systems are traditionally distinct areas of study. We have developed hands-on courseware to show how an adversary can compromise a CPS in a Stuxnet-like manner by tunneling through a layered sequence of network protocol and interface weaknesses. The courseware incorporates cyber-physical security concepts into effective learning modules that highlight real-world technical issues. This modular learning approach helps students understand CPS architectures and their vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks via experiential learning, and acquire practical skills through actively participating in the hands-on exercises.

The creation of a link between the theory learned from the textbook and what is happening in a real world circuit is considered vital to electrical engineering education, and the paper will describe how remote laboratories allow on- as well as off-campus students to take part in this training. A laboratory assignment should have a reasonable level of quality in order to have any meaning for the students. The introduction of remote laboratories in MOOCs, requires the remote laboratory installation to handle a large number of simultaneous users, and introduces several other new challenges that the universities needs to deal with. These include finding a solution to the problem of tutoring students when working on the laboratory assignments, in the remote laboratory environment. The authors has performed several surveys and statistical analysis of the grades among the students at their university, and the findings confirm in all aspects that the presented way of using remote laboratory does have a positive effect on the students' achievements, measured by their knowledge, skills and competencies, as well as their self-evaluation.

In recent years, module identification algorithms based on stochastic optimization algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms have been demonstrated to be superior to other algorithms on small- to medium-scale networks. However, the scalability and resolution limit (RL) problems of these module identification algorithms have not been fully addressed, which impeded their application to real-world networks. This paper proposes a novel module identification algorithm called cooperative co-evolutionary module identification to address these two problems. The proposed algorithm employs a cooperative co-evolutionary framework to handle large-scale networks. We also incorporate a recursive partitioning scheme into the algorithm to effectively address the RL problem. The performance of our algorithm is evaluated on 12 benchmark complex networks. As a medical application, we apply our algorithm to identify disease modules that differentiate low- and high-grade glioma tumors to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms that underpin the progression of glioma. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has a very competitive performance compared with other state-of-the-art module identification algorithms.","1089-778X;1089778X","","10.1109/TEVC.2016.2530311","Basic Research Program of Shenzhen; EU FP7-PEOPLE-2009-IRSES project through Nature Inspired Computation and its Applications; EU FP7-PEOPLE-2009-IRSES project under Nature Inspired Computation and its Applications; Guangdong Special Support Program of Top-Notch Young Professionals; Shenzhen Nanshan Innovation Institution Construction Program; 10.13039/501100000288 - Royal Society International Exchanges; 10.13039/501100000288 - Royal Society International Exchanges 2011 NSFC cost share scheme; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7422068","Community detection;complex networks;cooperation co-evolutionary;module identification","Benchmark testing;Clustering algorithms;Complex networks;Optimization;Partitioning algorithms;Sociology;Statistics","cancer;complex networks;evolutionary computation;identification;network theory (graphs);stochastic programming;tumours","cancer disease module discovery;community detection;complex networks;cooperative co-evolutionary module identification;evolutionary algorithms;high-grade glioma tumors;large-scale networks;low-grade glioma tumors;molecular mechanisms;network function;recursive partitioning;resolution limit;small-to medium-scale networks;stochastic optimization algorithms;topology","","3","","","","","20160229","Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to the interdependence, node failures in one network may lead to failures of the other network and result in cascading failures of the whole system. One of the reasons for this phenomena is attributed to the connectivity of the interdependent system, which hinges heavily on the operation probability (or equivalently reliability) of networks in the light of node reliability. In this paper, we present the model of k-reliability, define cascading failures based on k-reliability, and propose an algorithm to calculate k-reliability for estimation of potential cascading failures. The proposed k-reliability, defined as the probability that at least k surviving nodes span an operating subnetwork, explains the operation probability of the system and reflects the connectivity of nodes in networks. In particular, we find that the network with regular interlink allocation strategy is homogeneous to the network with maximum k-reliability in class of graphs with 2n nodes and 2d edges when the information of intratopology is unknown. That is, regardless of the information of each individual network, the strategy that all nodes in the system are allotted the same number of bidirectional interlinks yields better performance on k- reliability than all other possible strategies both analytically and experimentally.","0018-9529;00189529","","10.1109/TR.2016.2606125","10.13039/100007219 - Natural Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100003395 - Shanghai Municipal Education Commission; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7572896","Cascading failures;cyber-physical system;k-reliability","Computer network reliability;Cyber-physical systems;Modeling;Power system faults;Power system protection;Telecommunication network reliability","cyber-physical systems;graph theory;software reliability;system recovery","bidirectional interlinks;cascading failures;cyber network overlays;cyber-physical system;interdependent system;k-reliability model;node failures;node reliability;operating subnetwork;operation probability;physical network;regular interlink allocation strategy;two interacting networks","","","","","","","20160921","Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Computer Science and Engineering discipline comprises the core courses like mathematics, system, database, networks and programming language courses, etc according to ACM standards. The curriculum is designed in such a way that the core courses are related to each other in one or the other way. Since the related core courses are not handled by the same faculty in successive semesters because of instability of staff in the department of many Engineering Colleges, most of the time courses are taught in an isolated way. So the students are unable to correlate the core courses during their studies. Courses like the Mini and Capstone projects require the concept of core courses that time students are unable to use and correlate the concepts in carrying out these courses. This motivates the authors to select connectivity of courses as a topic to write this article. Object Oriented Modeling and Design course is focused on OO design techniques like Class model, State model, Interaction model and the students are studying this course in the final year. The authors conducted two pedagogy activities to model capstone project design through OOMD course. OO design techniques are explored using Unified Modeling Language constructs. First activity focuses on the model design manually and second designing activity is carried out using open source design tools like StarUML, E-Draw etc. to design their capstone project. Assignments considered in OOMD course are based on capstone project design. Using OO design concepts students are able to design system design, layered architecture and component designs for their capstone project and are also capable to provide alternative design solutions.

In this paper, following the detection-by-ranking approach, we address above challenges by learning a robust latent representation from multiple, noisy and a high probability of the complementary features. Both the textual features and the visual ones are encoded into a k-nearest neighbor hybrid similarity graph (HSG), where nonnegative matrix factorization using random walk is introduced to generate topic candidates. An efficient fusion of multiple HSGs is then done by a latent poisson deconvolution, which consists of a poisson deconvolution with sparse basis similarity for each edge.

This software can be used both in classical and in modern control theory subjects. The tool used to generate this graphical interface is Easy Java Simulations, which allows us to implement interactive simulations of physical systems in a quite intuitive way. Two different physical systems have been included: a position control system and an active vehicle suspension model. The user can choose any of these two systems and configure freely all their parameters. Also, an identification process of the system can be carried out by introducing a specific input and measuring the evolution of the output or other variables. After that, the controller can be designed and tested. Several configurations have been included in the tool: PID and controllers through state feedback. The second option includes the possibility of adding a state observer in case only the input and the output are measurable and an integral action to set the steady state. The graphical simulations offer the maximum interactivity since the user can change any of the parameters of the controllers during the simulation and/or the value of the reference input and observe the evolution of the system and the graphical representation of the evolution of the output. In this paper we present some details of implementation of the platform and the educational possibilities it offers.","","","10.1109/CCA.2016.7587922","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7587922","","Automation;Laboratories;Mathematical model;Observers;State feedback;Systems engineering and theory","Java;control engineering computing;control engineering education;control system synthesis;digital simulation;graphical user interfaces;interactive systems;observers;position control;state feedback;suspensions (mechanical components);three-term control","Easy Java Simulations;PID controller;active vehicle suspension model;control system simulation;control technique;controller design;controller testing;graphical interface development;graphical representation;integral action;interactive simulation;parameter configuration;physical system;position control system;software tool;state feedback;state observer;system evolution;system identification process","","","","","","","","19-22 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The new GE framework, which is named collaborative GE (CGE) framework, enjoys many desirable properties of CR. From theoretical analysis, CGE is robust to the noise and has the same computational complexity as GE. From experimental analysis, CGE can generally enhance the subspace learning algorithms and a reasonable regularization parameter can be inferred from its intrinsic graph. Several state-of-the-art subspace learning algorithms are plugged into our framework to produce their collaborative versions. Meanwhile, by exploring the intrinsic relation among GE methods, we present a new collaborative method named collaborative class-scattering locality preserving projections (CCSLPPs).

In this paper, we present a novel orientation estimation and calibration algorithm MSOE, a multiple states orientation estimation based on the smartphones inertial measurement units consisting of tri-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and MARG sensors. MSOE is divided into two parts, MSOE calibration (MSOE-C) and MSOE remainder (MSOE-R). MSOE-C skillfully borrows the crowdsourcing data expressed in the form of variational quaternions measured by the phones in the same magnet field. As the non-uniform nature exists inevitably when the crowd-phones are far away from the determinand, the crowdsourcing data may be erroneous. MSOE-R provides us a reminder by warning the control center to prevent measuring by the magnetometer and mainly utilize the gyroscope for estimation during the period with unstable environment. MSOE also incorporates a compensation filter for the tri-axis sensors deviation, especially for the gyroscope drifting. Performance has been evaluated empirically in two different Android platforms with four types of phones based on the available measurement system.

However, how to effectively and efficiently detect functional modules in large-scale PPI networks is still a challenging problem. We present a new framework, based on a multiple-grain model of PPI networks, to detect functional modules in PPI networks. First, we give a multiple-grain representation model of a PPI network, which has a smaller scale with super nodes. Next, we design the protein grain partitioning method, which employs a functional similarity or a structural similarity to merge some proteins layer by layer. Thirdly, a refining mechanism with border node tests is proposed to address the protein overlapping of different modules during the grain eliminating process. Finally, systematic experiments are conducted on five large-scale yeast and human networks. The results show that the framework not only significantly reduces the running time of functional module detection, but also effectively identifies overlapping modules while keeping some competitive performances, thus it is highly competent to detect functional modules in large-scale PPI networks.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2015.2480066","Beijing Municipal Education Research Plan key project (Beijing Municipal Fund Class B); National ¿973¿ Key Basic Research Program of China; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - NSFC Research Program; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7272054","Computational biology;functional module detection;large-scale PPI networks;multiple-grain model","Bioinformatics;Complexity theory;Computational biology;Merging;Partitioning algorithms;Proteins","bioinformatics;biological techniques;macromolecules;proteins;proteomics","computational approach;functional module detection;grain eliminating process;multiple-grain model;protein grain partitioning method;protein-protein interaction networks;proteomics research;structural similarity","","","","","","OAPA","20150918","July-Aug. 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The cells were cleaved into individual chips after fabrication. Some chips were coated with thin films of polymers that fully infiltrated the slots. Measurements of spectral loss were made on the grating coupler waveguide devices of both coated and uncoated chips. Individual devices exhibited insertion losses varying from several dB up to values so great that the response was below the noise floor of the optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) employed as a receiver. The chips that failed the transmission test were primarily uncoated ones. Nominally identical devices on different chips exhibited nominally identical behavior. A commercial software program was used to simulate each of the structures that were included in the 200 device test. The simulations were seen to agree quantitatively well with the experimental results and to show a degree of qualitative agreement. Comparison of the experiment and the simulations indicate that the loss inherent in a slot waveguide is quite low. Also near loss free couplers from ridges to slots are achievable. Use of a surface roughness model in comparison with analytical results for slow mode propagation indicates that the excess loss that slots exhibit with respect to a ridge mode counterpart arise almost solely from surface scattering off the surface roughness. The increased loss in the case of the slot guide arises from the higher electromagnetic energy density at the surface of the guide due to the electric field discontinuity that is employed as a guidance mechanism in slot modes in contradistinction to ridge modes that are index-guided. Conclusions include some speculation as to the limits on the loss that can be achieved by variation aware design of slot guides without any improvement in surface roughness over what is now availabl- with fabrication in commercial foundries.","0733-8724;07338724","","10.1109/JLT.2016.2554467","CAREER: Communication System Design for Future Integrated Circuit; EMT/NANO: Broadcast Optical Interconnects for Global Communication in Many-Core Chips Multiprocessor; I-Corps: Multiwavelength Integrated Nanophotonic Transceiver; Lightwave Logic, Inc.; Republic of Iraq; Research and Development Directorate; Silicon Organic Hybrid for Data Communication; 10.13039/100000001 - NSF; 10.13039/100000151 - IIP; 10.13039/100009122 - Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7452535","Optical losses;optical propagation;optical scattering;optical waveguides;optics;silicon on insulator technology","Couplers;Optical losses;Optical surface waves;Optical waveguides;Propagation losses;Rough surfaces;Silicon","diffraction gratings;integrated optoelectronics;light propagation;optical arrays;optical couplers;optical fabrication;optical losses;optical noise;optical polymers;optical waveguides;polymer films;silicon-on-insulator;surface roughness","Si;coated chips;electric field discontinuity;electromagnetic energy density;grating coupler waveguide devices;insertion loss;noise floor;optical spectrum analyzer;polymer thin films;receiver;rib width;ridge modes;silicon-on-insulator slot waveguide device array;slot length;slot mode device loss;slot width;slow mode propagation;software program;spectral loss;surface roughness model;surface scattering;taper length;transmission test;uncoated chips","","","","","","","20160414","Aug.15, 15 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Motivated by this obstruction, this paper proposes a microwave heating finite-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, which can not only describe the thermodynamics field with nonhomogeneous boundary conditions but also be coupled with the variation of electromagnetic field in temperature-dependent dielectric media. Initially, the equivalent PDE model with a homogeneous boundary condition is derived by constructing an auxiliary function in order to directly derive the eigenspectrum of the spatial differential operator. With the help of model-reduction techniques, the dominant dynamics of temperature distribution are subsequently captured with a reasonable Galerkin truncation. The simulation results on microwave heating a water prototype show that the temporal and the spatial evolution of the temperature profile can be described by solving the temperature-dependent electromagnetic field and the finite-dimensional ODE model. Moreover, the effectiveness of the model is verified by comparing with the numerical results from the traditional COMSOL model. A further development of this ODE model may provide a useful numerical tool for the design and synthesis of microwave heaters to avoid thermal runaway phenomena.","0018-9480;00189480","","10.1109/TMTT.2016.2584613","National Basic Research Program of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7513388","Microwave heating;model reduction;spectral Galerkin method;temperature dependent","Boundary conditions;Electromagnetic heating;Heat transfer;Mathematical model;Microwave theory and techniques;Numerical models","Galerkin method;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;heat transfer;microwave heating;partial differential equations;permittivity;temperature distribution","COMSOL model;Galerkin truncation;PDE model;coupled electromagnetic model;eigenspectrum;finite-dimensional ODE model;finite-dimensional ordinary differential equation model;heat transfer ODE model;microwave heating;model-reduction technique;nonhomogeneous boundary condition;partial differential equation;spatial differential operator;temperature distribution;temperature-dependent dielectric media;temperature-dependent electromagnetic field;temperature-dependent permittivity;thermodynamics field","","","","","","","20160714","Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One important issue with probabilistic model checking, which is crucial for its practical significance but is overlooked by the state-of-the-art largely, is the potential discrepancy between a stochastic model and the real-world system it represents when the model is built from statistical data. In the worst case, a tiny but nontrivial change to some model quantities might lead to misleading or even invalid verification results. To address this issue, in this paper, we present a mathematical characterization of the consequences of model perturbations on the verification distance. The formal model that we adopt is a parametric variant of discrete-time Markov chains equipped with a vector norm to measure the perturbation. Our main technical contributions include a closed-form formulation of asymptotic perturbation bounds, and computational methods for two arguably most useful forms of those bounds, namely linear bounds and quadratic bounds. We focus on verification of reachability properties but also address automata-based verification of omega-regular properties. We present the results of a selection of case studies that demonstrate that asymptotic perturbation bounds can accurately estimate maximum variations of verification results induced by model perturbations.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2015.2508444","Singapore Ministry of Education; State Key Laboratory of Novel Software Technology at Nanjing University; 10.13039/100006296 - CAS/SAFEA; 10.13039/501100000923 - Australian Research Council; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7355393","Asymptotic perturbation bound;discrete-time Markov chain;numerical iteration;optimization;parametric Markov chain;perturbation analysis;probabilistic model checking;quadratic programming","Computational modeling;Markov processes;Mathematical model;Model checking;Perturbation methods;Probabilistic logic","Markov processes;automata theory;formal verification;linear programming;probability;quadratic programming;reachability analysis","asymptotic perturbation bounds;automata-based verification;closed-form formulation;computational methods;empirically determined probability parameters;formal model;linear bounds;mathematical characterization;maximum verification variation estimation;model perturbations;omega-regular properties;parametric discrete-time Markov chains;perturbation measure;probabilistic model checking;quadratic bounds;reachability property verification;real-world system;statistical data;stochastic model;vector norm;verification distance;verification technique","","1","","53","","","20151217","July 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For this reason, personality traits could be a predictor for software piracy. This study investigates personality traits as a factor in students intention to pirate software by enhancing the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) model. The objective of this current research is to provide a preliminary test on the personality traits with the TPB model in software piracy behaviour in order to determine the reliability and validating instruments.The personality traits used in this study were extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness according to Big Five Inventory (BFI). A survey was conducted to achieve the research objective. Questionnaire was carried out on 40 computer sciences students to determine how reliable and valid it would be to proceed with further research. This study has been compared with previous studies, and several minor modifications of the instrument were made. All the instruments were validated and applied in the actual study. The results of factor analyses confirm and refine the reliability of the instruments for both big five personality variables and TPB elements in software piracy.

For courses involving external clients, the course owner typically follows a Request for Proposal process to vet (or green-light) qualified clients and projects. Even though green-lighting projects does not guarantee project success, the goal is to reduce risks by systematically examining each proposal to identify potential problems that the instructor could solve, mitigate against, or simply decide not to deal with by rejecting the proposal. We propose and evaluate a Green-Lighting Approach based on the SEMAT (Software Engineering Method and Theory) Essence framework. Our objective is to identify if such a framework could improve the Request for Proposal process at Carnegie Mellon University in Silicon Valley and other universities. We conducted a case study by observing and interviewing the course owner, examining a group of proposals, and identifying issues with the current proposal process and practicum projects. We proposed a green-lighting project state that, based upon Essence Alphas, describes the minimal and ideal states that a project proposal should achieve to be accepted. The Green-Lighting Approach generated conversations among the faculty that clarified the guidelines for accepting and prioritizing proposals and identified deficiencies in our Request for Proposal. Additional work is required to refine the proposed Green-Lighting Approach based on current findings and further validate the approach. Using Essence for green-lighting practicum projects in academia presents some limitations. The framework does not explicitly factor in business forces that affect proposal selection, might be overly complex for the task, and might require modification with partial Alpha states. However, Essence provides a systematic approach for evaluating proposals based on various project dimensions. This approach could be used as an inspiration for deriving simpler custom green-ligh- ing checklists.","","CD-ROM:978-1-5090-0764-6; Electronic:978-1-5090-0765-3; POD:978-1-5090-0766-0","10.1109/CSEET.2016.14","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7474482","Green-Lighting Proposals;SEMAT;Team-based Project Courses","Kernel;Proposals;Silicon;Software engineering;Software systems;Stakeholders","computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;software engineering","Carnegie Mellon University;SEMAT;Silicon Valley;green-lighting projects;software engineering method-and-theory;software engineering team-based project courses","","","","14","","","","5-6 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, to properly assess the programming skills of such people, the anticipated difficulty level of these coding questions should be estimated and kept in mind throughout the preparation of such exams. Poor results coming out of these assessment tools may not be entirely attributed to exam takers, but rather to the poor design of the exams that fail to gauge the competency levels of each student via the ranked levels of difficulty of questions on the exam. In this research, we argue that we can develop a predictive tool, named the Predicted Difficulty Index (PDI), that is derived from the structure of the sample solutions to rank the questions based on the difficulty that students may encounter while solving them. Such prior knowledge about questions' complexity should help instructors assign questions the proper points and place them in a progressive order throughout the exam leading to a more reliable evaluation tool.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8633-3; POD:978-1-4673-8634-0","10.1109/EDUCON.2016.7474601","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7474601","assessment;code metrics;novice code writing questions;question difficulty","Complexity theory;Correlation;Programming;Software metrics;Taxonomy;Writing","computer science education;programming;software metrics","IT students;PDI;assessment tools;code writing question difficulty prediction;competition contestant;evaluation tool;exam design;exam preparation;job interviewee;predicted difficulty index;predictive tool;programming skills;question complexity;software metrics;student competency level","","","","29","","","","10-13 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents an experimental framework of a new pedagogical method using LEGOs for teaching software estimation and measurement concepts and methods. The framework is evaluated through two case study sessions: one on experienced industry part-time students, one on inexperienced on-campus students. Results from both sessions indicate a positive impact on student learning. This teaching technique, since it appears to reinforce software engineering estimation heuristics and models, has the potential to be extended for other software estimation experiential education and experimentation, such as demonstrating the impact of anchoring on estimations.

Thus, a power laboratory course with emphasis on the nexus between power electronics and power system is desired. However, the flexibility of instructors in designing a wide range of educational experiments is limited by the use of specialized educational setups. This problem can be resolved by allowing students to assemble their setups using laboratory scaled-down devices; however, implementation times can limit students to focus on the main concepts of the experiments. In particular, lacking experience with hardware description languages to develop switching patterns and control schemes for solid-state based converters further increases the implementation times. In this paper, a technique for rapidly implementing switching patterns and control schemes for power converters is proposed. This technique provides an easy-to-use laboratory allowing students to focus on reinforcing the theory learned in energy conversion, motor-drive, power electronics, and power system classes while still providing instructors with the flexibility to design a wide range of educational experiments.","0885-8950;08858950","","10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2475600","10.13039/100000001; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7271123","FPGA applications in power laboratory;power engineering education;solid-state based power converters","Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Hardware design languages;Inverters;Laboratories;Radiation detectors;Software packages","motor drives;power convertors;power electronics;power engineering education;power grids;student experiments","control scheme;educational experiment;energy conversion;instructor;laboratory scaled-down device;motor-drive;power electronics;power engineering laboratories;power grid;power laboratory course;power system analysis;renewable energy generation unit;solid-state based converter;specialized educational setup;students;switching pattern","","3","","17","","","20150917","July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Reducing the number of edges is also an important factor for improving the readability of graphs. However, no edge concentration method with the explicit purpose of minimizing the number of edges has previously been studied. In this study, we propose a novel, efficient heuristic method for minimizing the number of edges during edge concentration. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method via a comparison using randomly generated graphs. We find that Newbery's method fails to reduce the number of edges when the number of vertices is large. By contrast, the proposed method achieves an average compression ratio of 47 to 82 percent for all generated graph groups.

Using a simple but realistic set of assumptions, we propose a general model for software testing and define sampling strategies for random (R) and systematic (S<sub>0</sub>) testing, where each sampling is associated with a sampling cost: 1 and c units of time, respectively. The two most important goals of software testing are: (i) achieving in minimal time a given degree of confidence x in a program's correctness and (ii) discovering a maximal number of errors within a given time bound n̂. For both (i) and (ii), we show that there exists a bound on c beyond which R performs better than S<sub>0</sub> on the average. Moreover for (i), this bound depends asymptotically only on x. We also show that the efficiency of R can be fitted to the exponential curve. Using these results we design a hybrid strategy H that starts with R and switches to S<sub>0</sub> when S<sub>0</sub> is expected to discover more errors per unit time. In our experiments we find that H performs similarly or better than the most efficient of both and that S<sub>0</sub> may need to be significantly faster than our bounds suggest to retain efficiency over R.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2015.2487274","SPECMATE; 10.13039/501100000781 - ERC; 10.13039/501100001459 - Singapore's Ministry of Education; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7289448","Efficient Testing;Error-based Partitioning;Partition Testing;Partition testing;Random Testing;Testing Theory;efficient testing;error-based partitioning;random testing;testing theory","Color;Input variables;Random variables;Software engineering;Software testing;Systematics","probability;program testing","automated software testing;exponential curve;hybrid strategy;probabilistic analysis;random testing;sampling strategies;systematic testing","","","","37","","","20151005","April 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to avoid over interactions of the servers and given the work volume and green computations, load balancing in cloud computing is of enormous importance requiring dynamic load distribution in a proportionate manner among the servers. Load balancing may reduce the used energy through avoiding over interaction between the nodes and virtual machines providing desired resource utilization. When a system fails, high costs are imposed on both server and customer, thus load balancing algorithm needs good fault tolerance. There are various techniques to increase fault tolerance. In this study task replication technique was used. To do so three fuzzy inference engines with an approach to fault tolerance for tasks prioritization, virtual prioritization and virtual machines as a goal for task replication were designed. Fuzzy method was selected because the question environment is uncertain and the parameters determination which is carried out by fuzzy method. In the proposed procedure by tasks and virtual priority, we could provide a proper work load distribution.

To evaluate the system performance or guide the rate-distortion-optimization process of 3-DV coding, the distortion/PSNR of the virtual view should be calculated by measuring the quality difference between the virtual view synthesized by compressed 3-DVs with one synthesized by uncompressed 3-DVs, which increases the complexity of a 3-DV system. In order to reduce the complexity of 3-DV system, it is better to estimate virtual view distortions/PSNR directly without rendering virtual views. In this paper, the virtual view synthesis procedure and the distortion propagation from existing views to virtual views are analyzed in detail, and then a virtual view distortion/PSNR estimation method is derived. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method could estimate PSNRs of virtual views accurately. The squared correlation coefficient and root of mean squared error between the estimated PSNRs by the proposed method and the actual PSNRs are 0.998 and 2.012 on average for all the tested sequences. Since the proposed method is implemented row-by-row independently, it is also friendly for parallel design. The execute time for each row of pictures with 1024 × 768 resolution is only 0.079 s, while for pictures with 1920 × 1088 resolution it is only 0.155 s.","0018-9316;00189316","","10.1109/TBC.2015.2492461","City University of Hong Kong Applied Research; City University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Research Institute, Shenzhen, China; Key laboratory of wireless sensor network and communication, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Ph.D. Programs Foundation, Ministry of Education of China; Shenzhen Emerging Industries of Strategic Basic Research Project; Young Scholars Program of Shandong University (YSPSDU); 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7321813","3DV;Distortion estimation;video coding","Cameras;Complexity theory;Distortion;Encoding;Estimation;Three-dimensional displays;Videos","estimation theory;image texture;mean square error methods;rate distortion theory;video coding","3-D videos;mean squared error root;n-view depth maps;n-view texture videos;neighboring texture videos;rate-distortion-optimization process;three-dimensional videos;virtual view PSNR estimation method;virtual view synthesis procedure","","4","","17","","","20151106","March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

At present, the theory has been studied extensively and found wide applications in fields like machine learning, software engineering, information retrieval, etc. Normally, in some complex information systems, the binary relation of domain of any attribute is a more general binary relation, which does not satisfies common properties such as reflexivity, transitivity or symmetry. Meanwhile, because the large differences may exist in different attributes, there may exist completely different types of binary relations in different domains of attributes. As is stated above, by introducing concept lattice into rough set theory, this paper expands equivalence relation, dominance relation, similarity relation etc. to a more general binary relation, and then discusses the granularity model for the general binary relation mentioned above. Based on this, a new knowledge acquisition model based on concept lattice is proposed. In the paper, a algebraic structure can be drawn from a complex information system, which is a lattice in essence. In additional, the paper mainly probes into attribute reduct, core in complicated information systems; Finally, how to eliminate redundant rules in decision tables is studied.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7681-5; Electronic:978-1-4673-7682-2; POD:978-1-4673-7683-9","10.1109/FSKD.2015.7381941","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7381941","Concept Lattice;Formal Concept Analysis;Rough Set","Analytical models;Context;Formal concept analysis;Information systems;Knowledge discovery;Lattices;Set theory","decision tables;equivalence classes;formal concept analysis;information systems;knowledge acquisition;rough set theory","algebraic structure;attribute reduction;binary relation;complex information systems;concept lattice;decision tables;dominance relation;equivalence relation;formal concept analysis;granularity model;knowledge acquisition model;redundant rule elimination;rough set model;similarity relation","","","","35","","","","15-17 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Yet, software engineers often argue that it demands more than half of the costs of a software project. Thus, proper testing education is of paramount importance. In fact, the mere exposition to ST knowledge might have an impact on programming skills. In particular, it can encourage the production of more reliable code. Although this is intuitive, to the best of our knowledge, there are no empirical studies about such effects. Evidence on this matter is important to motivate - or demotivate - classical testing education. Concerned with this, we have conducted a study to investigate the possible impact of ST knowledge on the production of reliable code. Our controlled experiment involved 28 senior-level Computer Science students, 8 auxiliary functions with 92 test cases, and a total of 112 implementations. Results show that code delivered after the exposition to ST knowledge is, on average, 20% more reliable (a significant difference at the 0.01 level). Also, implementations delivered afterwards are not significantly larger in terms of lines of code. This indicates that ST knowledge can make developers produce more reliable software with no additional overhead in terms of program size.","","CD-ROM:978-1-5090-0405-8; Electronic:978-1-5090-0406-5; POD:978-1-5090-0407-2","10.1109/ISSRE.2015.7381829","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7381829","computer science education;software testing;student experiments","Complexity theory;Programming;Software;Software reliability;Software testing","computer science education;program testing;software reliability","ST knowledge;auxiliary functions;code lines;program size;programming skills;reliable code production;senior-level computer science students;software development;software project;software testing education;student demotivation;student motivation;test cases","","","","35","","","","2-5 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Students can submit their homework and in-class test in specified location quickly. The indoor positioning system is the foundation of the LBS teaching platform. However, the current indoor localization based on WIFI(Wireless Fidelity) fingerprint cannot consider both effects of environment to AP(Access Point) and complexity of localization algorithm, leading to the result of low location accuracy or consume more resources of mobile equipment. This paper proposes an optimized Indoor Positioning algorithm based on WIFI. It uses a reliable AP algorithm as AP selection algorithm to reduce the effects of the indoor environment, and takes reliable AP algorithm combining hybrid of KNN(K-Nearest Neighbor) and Bayesian decision into account to obtain better location accuracy and to reduce complexity of positioning computation possibly.

The hardware is inexpensive, costing only $50, thus allowing students to buy their own boards. The LiB comes with teaching materials, but beyond the use of the audio codec software library, essentially all of this new course was developed by rewriting teaching materials from a previous course, and making extensive changes to adapt to the new software and hardware. Of particular interest is CMSIS-DSP, the Cortex-M Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) DSP library, which contains over 60 DSP algorithms in both fixed-point and floating-point. By using this library students become familiar with the Misra C coding standard, and software re-use. Developing algorithms in C from scratch is still needed and encouraged. When writing a custom filter algorithm for example, the students can benchmark against one or more CMSIS-DSP library algorithms.

Though popular for having a ""low floor"" (easy to get started), programs written in block-based languages often become unwieldy as projects grow progressively more complex. Software refactoring - improving the design quality of a codebase while preserving its external functionality - has been shown highly effective as a means of improving the quality of software written in text-based languages. Unfortunately, programming environments for blocks lack systematic software refactoring support. In this position paper, we argue that first-class software refactoring support must become an essential feature in programming environments for blocks; we present our research vision and concrete research directions, including program analysis to detect ""code smells,"" automated transformations for block-based programs to support common refactoring techniques, and integration of refactoring into introductory computing curricula.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8367-7; POD:978-1-4673-8368-4","10.1109/BLOCKS.2015.7369015","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7369015","block-based programming languages;code smells;computer science curriculum;end-user software engineering;introductory programming;metrics;refactoring","Complexity theory;Measurement;Programming environments;Programming profession;Software;Visualization","computer science education;software maintenance;software quality","automated block-based program transformations;block-based programming languages;code smell detection;codebase design quality improvement;development environments;educational platform;external functionality;first-class software refactoring support;low-floor programs;program analysis;software quality improvement;text-based languages","","","","12","","","","22-22 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The term SDR came into more common usage in 1992 by Dr. Joe Mitola, but actually had its beginnings back in 1984 at E-Systems. The ideal SDR receiver consists of an antenna connected to an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) followed by a digital signal processing system (DSPS) to extract the signal of interest. Low-cost, as in $20, SDR receivers originally designed for digital video broadcasting, have been available for several years. Giving undergraduate students hands-on experience in this area is needed. In this paper we describe the details of an SDR laboratory experiment for students in a first semester communications theory course.

The NFR problems in a system reflect the complexity of that system. Ideally, NFRs are systematically investigated to determine the aspects that may be harmonious or cause conflicts so that conflicts should be detected as early as possible. The work aims to extend the scopes of the NFRs framework and softgoal interdependency graph (SIG) for modelling and analysing NFRs. A formal ontological approach to modelling NFR interactions is proposed, and a core NFR ontology is developed in the ontology web language. The mechanisms involved in NFR interactions with SIG models (through interdependencies in the softgoals) are investigated and formalised. The NFRs are first analyses using a semantic modelling process to provide evaluation criteria. Next, correlation rules for implicit softgoal interdependencies are proposed from knowledge of the domain, and rules for indirect semantic correlations are proposed by extending the delta evaluation method. Reasonable rules in the semantic web environment are defined to allow conflicts between NFRs in SIG instance models to be detected and analysed. A concepts proof is performed to illustrate tool support of the proposed method, and validate the rules for conflict detection.","1751-8806;17518806","","10.1049/iet-sen.2014.0153","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7360958","","","formal specification;formal verification;graph theory;knowledge representation languages;reasoning about programs;semantic Web;systems analysis","NFR interactions;NFR problems;SIG instance models;automated reasoning;delta evaluation method;formal ontological approach;indirect semantic correlations;nonfunctional requirement conflicts;ontology Web language;semantic Web environment;semantic modelling process;softgoal interdependency graph;software systems","","","","","","","","12 2015","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

The communication process is initiated via stimulation and amplification of the production of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions within a cell; these ions then diffuse through a physical connection between cells called a gap junction. Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling can be found in different classes of cell. In excitable cells, initiation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-signaling process is accompanied by an electrical component; for nonexcitable cell types, the electrical component is absent; while hybrid cells exhibit both behaviors. This paper provides a comparison and analysis of the communication behavior in tissues comprised three specific cell types that utilize Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling: epithelium cells (nonexcitable), smooth muscle cells (excitable), and astrocytes (hybrid). The analysis focuses on spatiotemporal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration dynamics and how they are influenced by the intracellular signaling process, the molecular diffusion delay, the gain and capacity of the communication channel, as well as intracellular signaling interference.

Students in these fields and particularly in the new Digital Culture major at Arizona State University (ASU) use signal processing tools in several of their projects and artistic endeavors. Yet the blind use of these DSP tools in other disciplines, without understanding their properties has been a long-standing problem. In fact, the broader issue is the disconnect between engineers that develop tools and artists that use them to design the next generation digital art applications. In that context, ASU has formed the Arts Media and Engineering (AME) School and more recently, the multidisciplinary undergraduate Digital Culture degree granting program. In order to provide formal training in signal processing to students that are non-Electrical Engineering majors, we piloted a new course titled Signal Processing for Digital Culture. This course, which is being offered online, teaches non-majors some of the basics of signal processing and covers several applications. The only prerequisite to the course is general sophomore calculus. This new online course contains several topics and is focused on an approach that teaches concepts by connecting theory to compelling applications. Future plans include introducing this course at Clarkson University as a Knowledge Area course open to students from all majors.","","Paper:978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344377","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344377","DSP online;arts and media;digital culture;signal processing","Digital signal processing;Finite impulse response filters;IIR filters;MATLAB","art;computer aided instruction;educational courses;electrical engineering computing;electrical engineering education;signal processing","DSP tool;digital culture;knowledge area course;media;next generation digital art application;online course;signal processing course;sophomore calculus","","","","18","","","","21-24 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Selecting such system for this study was intentional for the following two reasons 1) the system is difficult to understand and analyze because of the domain knowledge required to generate formal specifications in temporal logic and 2) the system is large and complex which lends itself to a wide range of applicable verification techniques, and thus highlights the differences in the capabilities of each of the software verification approaches. Students were assessed using multiple criteria including; examination in applying learned techniques, students' attitude toward the technique, perceived efficiency of the techniques in discovering software defects, and the ability of the technique to locate errors in the code beyond simply indicating their presence. The results of this work show that the students applied the learned techniques successfully and their attitudes towards software verification improved.","","Paper:978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344050","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344050","Computer Science Education;Debugging;Software Engineering;Software Testing","Complexity theory;Formal specifications;Formal verification;Software systems;Software testing","computer science education;formal specification;formal verification;program debugging;temporal logic","formal specification system;software defects;software verification techniques;student competency;temporal logic","","","","22","","","","21-24 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Limited by the competition rules, micromouse is easy to learn but difficult to master, which provides a high suitability with the teaching processes of foundation courses of embedded system for undergraduate students. This paper elaborates the emphasis, difficulties and innovation of the conversion process, of which the core is student engagement. In the class, students must take part in the whole micromouse design progress to comprehend the interactive method of hardware and software of embedded devices and strengthen the ability of applying professional skills. Students are required to participate in the entire micromouse building process, including welding, assembling, environment building, debugging and finishing the competition in groups. This curriculum focuses on training students' research interests, competition skills and teamwork spirit.

At the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP), experimental developments targeted students' commitment to create quality work, creating infrastructure to conduct personal reviews for different types of work products, and teaching students to conduct effective personal reviews of their own work. A partial implementation of check lists, review processes, and teaching material has been used in courses at UTEP. The work to be developed includes measuring time distributions of effort (time to build the product vs. time to correct the product), recording the defects injected in products, creating checklists based on the recorded defects, creating a process to review products, and defining a defect log.

It arose from the adaptation of a gamification design framework, commonly used in industry, into the specific context of high quality education in engineering. It is formulated at high level. Consequently, it should be useful for practitioners having different requirements and expectations. A developed practice, following the proposed cycle, is presented, discussed and evaluated. In particular, the proposal is applied and exemplified, in a scenario for teaching introductory concepts of computer programming in a first-year course. A digital game was used within a gamified learning experience, as a teaching tool. However, the learning process does not rely solely on the use of the game by itself. Moreover, the devised scenario has a purpose beyond edutainment: contributing to achievement of student outcomes, under a continuous improvement approach, according to ABET. A quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the developed practice was performed. A positive impact on students' emotional engagement and behavior was observed as a result of the evaluation process.","","Paper:978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344111","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344111","ABET criteria;continuous improvement;gamification;learning;student outcomes;teaching","Accreditation;Context;Continuous improvement;Games;Industries;Proposals","computer aided instruction;computer games;continuous improvement;educational courses;engineering education;teaching","ABET criteria;computer programming;continuous improvement approach;continuous improvement cycle;digital game;evaluation process;first-year course;gamification design framework;gamification theory;gamified learning experience;high quality education;learning engineering;learning process;positive impact;purpose beyond edutainment;qualitative evaluation;quantitative evaluation;student emotional engagement;teaching scenario;teaching tool","","","","35","","","","21-24 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the existing methods for predicting the hidden behavior, a lot of testing data (usually quantitative information) are needed to be sampled. However, some complex engineering systems have the following characteristics: 1) The systems cannot be tested periodically, and the observable information is incomplete; 2) the change process of hidden behavior may be affected by the test; and 3) only part of quantitative information and qualitative knowledge (i.e., semiquantitative information) may be obtained. These characteristics all related to the test are named as testing influence for simplicity. Although a model and a corresponding optimal algorithm for training the model parameters have been proposed to predict the hidden behavior on the basis of semiquantitative information and belief rule base (BRB), the testing influence has not been considered. In order to solve the above problems, a new BRB-based model, which can use the semiquantitative information, is proposed under testing influence in this paper. In the newly proposed forecasting model, there are some parameters of which the initial values are usually assigned by experts and may not be accurate, which can lead to the inaccurate prediction results. As such, an improved optimal algorithm for training the parameters of the forecasting model is further developed on the basis of the expectation-maximization idea and the covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy (CMA-ES). By using the semiquantitative information, the proposed BRB-based model and the improved CMA-ES algorithm can operate together in an integrated manner so as to improve the forecasting precision. A case study is examined to demonstrate the ability and applicability of the newly proposed BRB-based forecasting model and the improved CMA-ES algorithm.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2015.2426207","Foundation of Department of Education of Jilin Province of China; Joint Laboratory of Flight Vehicle Ocean-based Measurement and Control; NSFC; National Science Foundation of China (NSFC); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7094292","Belief rule base;Covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy;Hidden behavior;Prediction;Semi-quantitative information;Testing influence;covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy;hidden behavior;prediction;semiquantitative information;testing influence","Forecasting;Hidden Markov models;Linear programming;Mathematical model;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Testing","belief networks;covariance matrices;evolutionary computation;expectation-maximisation algorithm;forecasting theory;knowledge based systems;large-scale systems;prediction theory","BRB-based forecasting model;CMA-ES;belief rule base;complex system;covariance matrix adaption evolution strategy;expectation-maximization method;hidden behavior prediction;model parameter;optimal algorithm;parameter training;qualitative knowledge;semiquantitative information;testing influence","","5","","44","","","20150424","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Moreover, solving capacitated examination timetabling is more challenging compared to un-capacitated one. This paper implements graph heuristic with hill climbing search to solve the capacitated examination timetabling considering partial examination assignment concepts. The algorithm starts with ordering all the exams according to graph heuristic approach and then partial exams are considered for construction. Afterwards, the qualities of these exams are improved using hill climbing search. The entire process continues until scheduling all the exams. The effects of different graph heuristic orderings and exam assignment values on the quality of the solutions are studied. We test the proposed approach on ITC2007 benchmark exam datasets which contains highly constraint capacitated datasets. Experimental results reveal that the approach is able to produce quality solutions for all datasets and competitive results with competition results.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6722-6; POD:978-1-4673-6723-3; USB:978-1-4673-6721-9","10.1109/ICSECS.2015.7333095","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7333095","graph heuristics;hill climbing;optimzation;timetabling","Color;Computers;Heuristic algorithms;Linear programming;Search problems;Simulated annealing;Software engineering","computational complexity;education;graph theory;search problems","ITC2007 benchmark exam datasets;International Timetabling Competition datasets;NP-hard nature;capacitated examination timetabling problem;exam assignment values;graph heuristic approach;graph heuristic orderings;hill climbing search;partial examination assignment concept","","","","27","","","","19-21 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, in order to achieve higher coding efficiency , the inter-view dependency must be taken into account for inter-view bit allocation. In this paper, the inter-view dependency is analyzed in detail, and a rate-distortion (RD) model for NRVs is derived by taking the distortion of RV into account. Based on the derived RD model, the inter-view bit allocation is represented as a mathematical problem with an analytic form, and is solved by a convex optimization (Lagrangian Multiplier) method. Experimental results demonstrate that the RD performance and the inter-view quality consistency of the proposed method is better than existing methods, while the complexity of the proposed method is comparable with the existing methods.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2015.2477682","; City University of Hong Kong Applied Research; Excellent Youth Scientist Award Foundation of Shandong Province; Ph.D. Programs Foundation Ministry of Education of China; Young Scholars Program of Shandong University; key laboratory of wireless sensor network and communication; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7254194","Bit allocation;MV-HEVC;inter-view dependency;rate distortion optimization","Analytical models;Bit rate;Convex functions;Distortion;Rate distortion theory;Rate-distortion;Video coding","convex programming;rate distortion theory;video coding","Lagrangian multiplier method;MV-HEVC;NRV pictures;convex optimization;multiview video coding;nonreference view pictures;rate distortion optimized inter-view frame level bit allocation method","","5","","34","","","20150910","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The use of games has mainly been focused on other areas of software engineering, for example software project management. In an attempt to fill this gap, this paper describes a formal experiment carried out to assess the learning effectiveness of a serious game (DesigMPS), designed to support the teaching of SPM, and to compare game-based learning with a project-based learning method. In the DesigMPS game, the student models a software process from an SPI perspective, based on the Brazilian SPI model (MPS.BR).

In respect of multi-view learning, however, it is limited by its capability of only handling data represented by two-view features, while in many real-world applications, the number of views is frequently many more. Although the ad hoc way of simultaneously exploring all possible pairs of features can numerically deal with multi-view data, it ignores the high order statistics (correlation information) which can only be discovered by simultaneously exploring all features. Therefore, in this work, we develop tensor CCA (TCCA) which straightforwardly yet naturally generalizes CCA to handle the data of an arbitrary number of views by analyzing the covariance tensor of the different views. TCCA aims to directly maximize the canonical correlation of multiple (more than two) views. Crucially, we prove that the main problem of multi-view canonical correlation maximization is equivalent to finding the best rank-1 approximation of the data covariance tensor, which can be solved efficiently using the well-known alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm. As a consequence, the high order correlation information contained in the different views is explored and thus a more reliable common subspace shared by all features can be obtained. In addition, a non-linear extension of TCCA is presented. Experiments on various challenge tasks, including large scale biometric structure prediction, internet advertisement classification, and web image annotation, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2015.2445757","NBRPC; 10.13039/501100000923 - Australian Research Council Projects; 10.13039/501100000924 - MSRA; 10.13039/501100001459 - MOE; 10.13039/501100001809 - NSFC; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7123622","Multi-view;canonical correlation analysis;dimension reduction;high order statistics;multi-view;order statistics;tensor","Approximation methods;Correlation;Pairwise error probability;Tensile stress","approximation theory;correlation methods;data structures;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;statistics;tensors","ALS algorithm;CCA;Internet advertisement classification;Web image annotation;alternating least squares algorithm;correlation information;data covariance tensor;data representation;high order statistics;large scale biometric structure prediction;multiview data;multiview dimension reduction;multiview learning;rank-1 approximation;tensor canonical correlation analysis","","15","","63","","","20150615","Nov. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Through a program of courses and real world applications it is possible to extend a students knowledge and expertise in areas of relevance and get students on the cutting edge of technology. In addition, the use of multiple team projects enables students to work cooperatively, creatively and to apply theory to solutions for challenging ocean problems. Also, while building the students skills, we can use these programs to help deepen their understanding of the social and environmental impacts their solutions pose. To demonstrate their knowledge and depth of understanding in engineering practice, for many students we use complex ocean platforms and problems. Depending on the scale we sometimes break these into a series of stand-alone sub-systems. Each student has to complete a capstone project and compete for awards in their specific discipline as well as an overall first place within the school of engineering. The selection process is accomplished using industrial and academic engineers as judges with a fixed set of criteria and judging rules. At a minimum to graduate each student must demonstrate design and development of functional components, systems, tests, or services that meet the agreed on specifications in the context of economic, environmental, and societal requirements assigned by the student advisor. The skills that are judged include working in a team environment, contribution of knowledge and expertise, and a demonstration of leadership in their specific field of engineering on a multi-disciplinary team. They must also communicate effectively with colleagues, customers, subordinates, and managers, demonstrate in presentations and documentation for the capstone project. The competition is expressly designed to look at how w- ll students apply concepts of math, science, and engineering. Also, to see how effective their designs, experiments conducted, and data analysis apply to the capstone project goals.

To evaluate the safety of ship stiffened plate based on the fatigue crack propagation method, the key issue is to study the crack propagation rate for stiffened plate subjected to cyclic loading. In this paper, the fatigue crack propagation life has been calculated using elasto-plastic theory and Paris formula.

The entire process continues until all of the exams have been scheduled. We implement the proposed technique on the Toronto benchmark datasets. Experimental results indicate that in all problem instances, this proposed method outperforms traditional great deluge algorithm and when comparing with the state-of-the-art approaches, our approach produces competitive solution for all instances, with some cases outperform other reported result.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7952-3; POD:978-1-4799-7953-0; USB:978-1-4799-7951-6","10.1109/I4CT.2015.7219635","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7219635","graph heuristic;great deluge algorithm;timetable","Algorithm design and analysis;Benchmark testing;Europe;Heuristic algorithms;Optimization;Search problems;Software algorithms","education;graph theory","examination timetabling problem;graph heuristics;great deluge algorithm;partial exam assignment;quality timetable","","0","","37","","","","21-23 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is agreed that the concept refers to the use of computer games without the main purpose of pure entertainment. In addition to being entertaining, they have some additional educational or training objectives as well. Serious games are used in different areas such as military, government, educational, corporate, and healthcare. However, according to their individual differences, it is not always possible to provide such an educational environment that fits expectations and preferences of all audience. Hence, personalization is becoming an essential issue in serious game environments, which focus on a human-centered paradigm aiming to provide adaptive and personalized services to the users according to the context. However, how such a personalization should be affectively implemented in the design of serious games is a challenge. This study aims to better understand the affect of personality types on game play. For this purpose, a game-based simulation environment which also records all details of the player during the performance of several tasks in the game play was used. Twenty nine students were asked to play the simulation game. Additionally, their personality types were collected based on the theory of psychological types by Carl Jung, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) which measures personality preferences as defined by Four Dichotomous pairs of mental functions or attitudes. The correlation between these personality types and individual performance measures of players during the game play was analyzed. However no significant correlation between game parameters and the players' personality types has been recorded. This may be because of the limited number of participants that need to be examined in the future studies.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1756-3; POD:978-1-4799-1757-0; USB:978-1-4799-1755-6","10.1109/ITHET.2015.7218020","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218020","Education;Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI);Personality Types;Serious Games;Simulation","Accuracy;Correlation;Games;Navigation;Surgery;Training","human factors;psychology;serious games (computing)","MBTI;Myers-Briggs type indicator;educational environment;game parameters;game personalization;game-based simulation environment;human-centered paradigm;personality preference measure;personality type indicator models;psychological types theory;serious games;surgical navigation game","","0","","11","","","","11-13 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the proposed method, a user-friendly software package has been developed and some computation results are given. Unlike the commonly used numerical and intelligent methods, this method does not need to choose the initial values and can find all the solutions. Also, this method can give a definite answer to the question of whether the SHE equations have solutions or not, and the accuracy of the solved switching angles are much higher than that of the reference method.

Aim: We compare students and professionals to understand how well students represent professionals as experimental subjects in SE research. Method: The comparison was made in the context of two test-driven development experiments conducted with students in an academic setting and with professionals in a software organization. We measured the code quality of several tasks implemented by both subject groups and checked whether students and professionals perform similarly in terms of code quality metrics. Results: Except for minor differences, neither of the subject groups is better than the other. Professionals produce larger, yet less complex, methods when they use their traditional development approach, whereas both subject groups perform similarly when they apply a new approach for the first time. Conclusion: Given a carefully scoped experiment on a development approach that is new to both students and professionals, similar performances are observed.

While the team's success is indeed the primary goal of an industrial SE team, ensuring individual learning is obviously an essential goal of SE courses.

However, it was observed that the knowledge level is not appropriate for higher calibre students because the content used in the knowledge level is often referred to as simple. The comprehension level seemed appropriate for all levels of students as they were able to produce different solutions based on their understanding of the problem domain. Many international students had problems with the application level as they were unable to apply the concepts and theories in the laboratories. For the analysis level, some students had difficulties in breaking down the bigger problem into smaller components. Students had mixed responses to the synthesis level.

Most existing MOEAs can only perform well in one of those three aspects. In view of this, we aim to design a more balanced MOEA on ManyOPs in all three aspects at the same time. Among the existing MOEAs, the two-archive algorithm (Two_Arch) is a low-complexity algorithm with two archives focusing on convergence and diversity separately. Inspired by the idea of Two_Arch, we propose a significantly improved two-archive algorithm (i.e., Two_Arch2) for ManyOPs in this paper. In our Two_Arch2, we assign different selection principles (indicator-based and Pareto-based) to the two archives. In addition, we design a new Lp-norm-based (p <; 1) diversity maintenance scheme for ManyOPs in Two_Arch2. In order to evaluate the performance of Two_Arch2 on ManyOPs, we have compared it with several MOEAs on a wide range of benchmark problems with different numbers of objectives.

Virtual Labs are the future of education. Simulations, in which environmental measurements and data analysis can be simulated, are being created to combine real-world environments with information supplied by devices. Virtual Labs (VL) designed for educational purposes in Electrical Engineering provide tasks or problems within a virtual environment or context. Users can explore the environment and examine digital objects as they are designed to support inquiry-based learning and conceptual understanding. Online virtual labs simulate learning environments and are designed to be highly attractive. They can complement the traditional formal learning programs, providing the opportunity for an interaction across a range of learning experiences in 3D. Online learning such as virtual classrooms will become the major part of training education in the future. Virtual lab applications are an engaging and agreeable learning system. Educational virtual labs should not merely focus on the virtual environment; they are useful to help students learn to think creatively and understand the complexities of solving meaningful problems, but the support from the teacher is also important. This study presents a virtual scenario of an instrumentation and measurements laboratory. Students work with representations of electrical circuits focused on learning electrical concepts and circuit analysis, also studying and developing action procedures. The goal is to help them learn to think like engineers. While they are learning about circuit theory, they are also learning to apply the many skills of an engineer such as organizing information for writing technical reports. This work was developed to demonstrate how a desktop Virtual Reality (VR) prototype, ""Virtual Electric Manual""VEMA, c- n be applied to an engineering unit and used to enhance security and resourcefulness in using electrical equipment.

With the development of wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs), low-cost and self-organized wireless sensors and actuators can enhance smart building systems, but produce abundant sensing data. Therefore, a rule engine with ability of efficient rule matching is the foundation of WSANs based smart building systems. However, traditional rule engines mainly focus on the complex processing mechanism and omit the amount of sensing data, which are not suitable for large scale WSANs based smart building systems. To address these issues, we build an efficient rule engine. Specifically, we design an atomic event extraction module for extracting atomic event from data messages, and then build a β-network to acquire the atomic conditions for parsing the atomic trigger events. Taking the atomic trigger events as the key set of MPHF, we construct the minimal perfect hash table which can filter the majority of the unused atomic event with O(1) time overhead. Moreover, a rule engine adaption scheme is proposed to minimize the rule matching overhead. We implement the proposed rule engine in a practical smart building system. The experimental results show that the rule engine can perform efficiently and flexibly with high data throughput and large rule set.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2014.2345385","National Key Technology Research and Development Program of the Ministry of Science and Technology of China; Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6871310","Smart building system;minimal perfect hash function.;rule engine;rule matching","Actuators;Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Engines;Filtering;Smart buildings;Temperature sensors","actuators;building management systems;computational complexity;file organisation;network theory (graphs);pattern matching;wireless sensor networks","β-network;MPHF;O(1) time overhead;WSAN based smart building systems;atomic event extraction module;automatic control;complex processing mechanism;customized rules;low-cost self-organized wireless sensors;minimal perfect hash table;rule matching;rule matching overhead;sensed environment information matching;sensing data;unused atomic event;wireless sensor and actuator networks","","2","","30","","","20140805","June 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed approach follows a group, multi-criteria, similarity degree-based aggregation algorithm and results in an objective aggregation of the ratings of required task related skills and provided skills from candidate human resources. In addition, we consider skill relationships as 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic terms to reflect the contribution of one skill to the learning of other skills.

Adaptation and personalization in AEH are produced from interaction of learner, pedagogic, domain, adaptation, and presentation models. This paper discusses Knowledge Map, a prototype tool for managing and visualizing domain model of AEH and it integrates cognitively-oriented and pedagogically-oriented methods. Domain model organizes knowledge space, which contains a network of concepts or topics, and hyperspace, in which adaptation and personalization are offered to students. There are two methods implemented. The first method is cognitively-oriented, by which concepts learned in a course are organized in a network of concepts. With this first method, student can get a visualization of the network and explore nodes. The main drawback of this method is that students may get lost after doing deep exploration. The second is mixed pedagogically-oriented and cognitively-oriented method that organizes a course in a hierarchic structure of topics and sub-topics and a graph of concepts for each sub-topic. A Greedy algorithm has been implemented to guide students to certain topics. To test the methods' performances, a quantitative experiment has been conducted with three tested parameters: impression, learnability, and helpfulness. The experiments results show that the mixed method visualization is more impressive as this is more helpful for students to understand learning materials than the other method. Furthermore, the mixed method is more learnable, as students find it easier to gain a whole view of learning materials organized by this method rather than those organized by the cognitively-oriented method.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7996-7; POD:978-1-4799-7997-4","10.1109/ICODSE.2014.7062699","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062699","Adaptive Educational Hypermedia;Cognitively-oriented;Mixed pedagogically- and cognitively-oriented method;helpfulness;impression;learnability;quantitative experiment","Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Education;Materials;Prototypes;Visualization","computer aided instruction;data visualisation;educational courses;graph theory;greedy algorithms;hypermedia","AEH;adaptation model;adaptive educational hypermedia;cognitively-oriented method;concept graph;course;domain model management;domain model visualization;greedy algorithm;helpfulness;impression;knowledge map;knowledge space;learnability;learner model;learning content;learning materials;learning tool;mixed method visualization;pedagogic model;pedagogically-oriented method;presentation model;subtopic hierarchic structure","","0","","13","","","","26-27 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Demographic market segmentation is an approach to segmenting markets. A company divides the larger market into groups based on several defined criteria. Age, gender, marital status, occupation, education and income are among the commonly considered demographics segmentation criteria. A sample case study has been done in order to explain the theory of segmentation applied on a Turkish supermarket chain. The purpose of this case study is to determine dependency on products and shopping habits. Furthermore forecast sales determine the promotions of products and customer profiles. Association rule mining was used as a method for identifying customers buying patterns and as a result customer profiles were determined. Besides association rules, interesting results were found about customer profiles, such as ""What items do female customers buy?"" or ""What do consumers(married and 35-45 aged) prefer mostly?"". For instance, female customers purchase feta cheese with a percentage of 60% whereas male customers purchase tomato with a percentage of 46%.

Despite the different motivations of these algorithms, they can be interpreted by a common framework known as graph embedding. In order to explore the significant features of data, some sparse regression algorithms have been proposed based on graph embedding. However, the problem is that these algorithms include two separate steps: (1) embedding learning and (2) sparse regression. Thus their performance is largely determined by the effectiveness of the constructed graph. In this paper, we present a framework by combining the objective functions of graph embedding and sparse regression so that embedding learning and sparse regression can be jointly implemented and optimized, instead of simply using the graph spectral for sparse regression. By the proposed framework, supervised, semisupervised, and unsupervised learning algorithms could be unified. Furthermore, we analyze two situations of the optimization problem for the proposed framework. By adopting an ℓ<sub>2,1</sub>-norm regularization for the proposed framework, it can perform feature selection and subspace learning simultaneously. Experiments on seven standard databases demonstrate that joint graph embedding and sparse regression method can significantly improve the recognition performance and consistently outperform the sparse regression method.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2015.2405474","Key Laboratory of Measurement and Control of Complex Systems of Engineering, Ministry of Education, Southeast University, Nanjing, China; Shenzhen Special Fund for the Strategic Development of Emerging Industries; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045492","$L_{2, 1}$ -norm;Graph embedding;feature selection;sparse regression;subspace learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Joints;Optimization;Principal component analysis;Vectors","feature selection;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;regression analysis","L<sub>2,1</sub>-norm regularization;data features;embedding learning;feature selection;joint graph embedding-and-sparse regression method;objective functions;optimization problem;recognition performance improvement;semisupervised learning algorithm;standard databases;subspace learning;unsupervised learning algorithm","","14","","51","","","20150219","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To remove this inherent problem, weight measurement of computer programs is necessary. Although software is the outcome of human creative activity, cognitive informatics plays an important role in understanding its fundamental characteristics. In our research, a new software complexity measure based on cognitive weight of basic control structure has been proposed that reduce the limitations of existing measures. Primarily our aim is to build a question bank with programming problems. Our designed system will access the solution codes for finding out the weight of respective programming problem from the question bank by applying the proposed method. The method will find out the complexity according to our proposed cognitive weight model. It will facilitate the instructors distributing the programming problems among the students equivalently. Thus, the automatic complexity measurement will ensure the students obtaining equal problems for programming evaluation.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4167-4; Electronic:978-1-4799-4166-7; POD:978-1-4799-4165-0","10.1109/ICECE.2014.7026848","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7026848","Basic Control Structures;Cognitive Weights;Software Complexity;Weight Measurement","Algorithm design and analysis;Complexity theory;Computers;Programming;Software;Software measurement;Weight measurement","computer science education;educational courses;software metrics","automatic software complexity measurement;cognitive informatics;cognitive weight model;computer programs;control structure;equivalent programming problem distribution;fundamental characteristics;human creative activity;programming evaluation;question bank;software complexity measure;solution codes;weight measurement","","0","","7","","","","20-22 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These courses are challenging from both the students' and the instructors' points of view. From student feedback it has been seen that they view these subjects uninteresting due to a lack of practical component. The instructor's responsibility increases in making such theoretical subjects interesting for the students. These courses impart certain unique skills which the students need to apply in their professional careers. But the Lecture method which is still the most practiced and preferred one does not provide for active student involvement. To combat this problem a variety of teaching modes have been developed from different learning theories. Several of these techniques are in use in Post-graduate courses and corporate training courses where the number of participants is less. The author has tried some of these techniques like story-telling or case study approach, involved assignment and group correction, reverse knowledge transfer, i.e. teaching by students, etc. while teaching Information Systems for two sections of undergraduate students and has found reasonable success. This paper describes the techniques used by the author, the methodology, the implementation and the results thereof.

This paper describes a study of Irish technical communicators' perceptions of their field. The research methods include a survey, online discussions and interviews, and the findings are analyzed using the lenses of professionalization and community of practice theories. This study is exploratory, because no previous studies have examined the Irish context for technical communication. Considering the scope of both professional and communities of practice frameworks, the study is confined to four significant themes: education, technical communication practice, value and status, and professional and community structures. The findings indicate that Irish technical communicators exhibit traits of communities of practice (such as joint enterprise and shared repertoires). They also identify with their job title and practice. A key finding is that many Irish technical communicators have a keen appetite for community involvement. This enthusiasm notwithstanding, many barriers impede professionalization, not least the low visibility of the role in Ireland, limited evidence of professionalizing activity, and the potential for career stagnation.","2158-091X;2158091X","Electronic:978-1-4799-3749-3; POD:978-1-4799-3750-9","10.1109/IPCC.2014.7020354","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7020354","Community of practice;Ireland;practitioners;professionalization","Communities;Companies;Education;Engineering profession;Interviews;Writing","continuing professional development","Ireland;academic field;career stagnation;community involvement;community structure;community-of-practice theory;education;occupational field;practitioner perspective;professional structure;professionalization theory;technical communication field;technical communication practice","","0","","44","","","","13-15 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are specific tools focused on supporting self-regulation learning processes, but not each of them fulfill this task in the same manner. Additionally, there are generic tools that offer a good level of support for some of these processes. We believe that it is possible to offer good support for the self-regulation of learning through the use of software tools, but it is important to select them and evaluate the level of support that they can offer. In this respect, we studied self-regulated learning theory trying to understand the mechanisms of self-regulation and define the criteria for designing software tools with proper support for these self-regulated learning processes. On this basis we created a questionnaire for the evaluation of self-regulated learning support that allows to evaluate software tools in this respect, enable its selection and also provide useful information for software developers so they can improve their tools to offer better support.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4428-6; POD:978-1-4799-4427-9","10.1109/SIIE.2014.7017717","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7017717","Learning Strategy;Questionnaire;Self-regulated Learning;Software Tool Evaluation","Cognition;Context;Least squares approximations;Monitoring;Planning;Software tools","computer aided instruction","learning strategy;self-regulated learning support;self-regulated learning theory;self-regulation strategy;software tools;student knowledge","","0","","13","","","","12-14 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on this graph model, algorithms by synthesizing different recommendation patterns are designed to assist mashup completion, such as finding the missing components, connections between them, or potentially relevant options.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5054-6; POD:978-1-4799-5055-3","10.1109/ICWS.2014.120","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6928978","mobile;recommendation;service mashup;web application","Educational institutions;Integrated circuits;Mashups;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Steiner trees","Internet;graph theory;mobile computing;software engineering","graph-based approach;mashup completion;mobile Web application creation;mobile computing;recommendation patterns","","0","","3","","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, PV power output is highly volatile and may drastically change the power output within a few seconds. Therefore, voltage and frequency stability in an electric power system is brought under compromise. Power conditioning, using efficient and highly responsive means of energy storage, such as Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES), may be the solution to that problem. Although this technology is still not competitive in market terms, its main advantage being the fastest response of all energy storage options has led many researchers to investigate the technical aspects of SMES utilization. This paper investigates the use of a Current Source Converter (CSC)-based SMES system in the power conditioning of a PV power plant output. The charging and discharging of a superconducting coil is controlled in order to compensate for power fluctuations from the PV plant, caused by unexpected phenomena such as cloud shading. A parallel active filter topology is utilized and a control strategy based on the instantaneous ABC power theory is proposed to separate the power fluctuations from a constant power reference. The corresponding currents are then used as reference inputs to a space vector modulation, where the switching patterns for the CSC are produced. Finally, simulations are carried out using the PSIM software. The system capability to control and stabilize the power delivered to the grid for several seconds is investigated.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-6556-4; Electronic:978-1-4799-6557-1; POD:978-1-4799-6558-8","10.1109/UPEC.2014.6934705","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6934705","Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage;current source converter;instantaneous ABC theory;photovoltaic plants;power conditioning","Energy storage;Modulation;Power generation;Superconducting coils;Topology;Vectors","active filters;fluctuations;frequency stability;network topology;photovoltaic power systems;power grids;power markets;power system control;power system stability;superconducting coils;superconducting magnet energy storage;switching convertors","CSC-based SMES system;PSIM software;PV power output fluctuation control strategy;PV power plant;constant power reference;current source converter based SMES system;frequency stability;instantaneous ABC power theory;parallel active filter topology;photovoltaic power plant;power conditioning;power grid;power market;power stability;renewable energy source;space vector modulation;superconducting coil charging;superconducting coil discharging;superconducting magnetic energy storage;switching pattern;voltage stability","","0","","11","","","","2-5 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An evaluation model was constructed based on coding, clustering and comparison. A table of important teaching and learning behaviors was created for coding. The coding results showed that the features of the good classroom teaching are not the same. The fuzzy clustering algorithm was used to divide the good classroom teaching into several clusters, and the cluster-center was used to represent the cluster's feature. The correlation analysis was used to compare the unknown-level encode data with the cluster-center data. If they were similar, it can be inferred that the unknown-level classroom records were very likely good too. Otherwise, the unknowns very likely were not good.

We focus on several features of SaaS competition, including differences in vendor offerings, incomplete information on application functionality, the potential lock-in risk of SaaS clients, and their cost of learning about what it will take to make the vendors' software work well. Clients can sample the fit costs of adoption, but can switch to another vendor. We obtained several findings through the use of a game-theoretic model. First, a client's switching cost is important for its decision-making regarding SaaS adoption. With a relatively high switching cost, a more cost-efficient vendor of IT services will be able to drive the less cost-efficient competitor out of its market. Second, the impact of the client's switching cost on vendors works differently. An increase in switching cost enables one vendor to charge a higher price and achieve higher profit, while the other will be forced to charge a lower price and hardly make a profit. Third, what matters is not how much a vendor can enhance service quality, but instead how costly it will be to improve quality enough to attract sufficient customer interest to achieve profitability.","0018-9391;00189391","","10.1109/TEM.2014.2332633","Lee Kuan Yew Faculty Fellowship for Research Excellence at Singapore Management University; Singapore's Ministry of Education Tier 1 Research Support Program; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6857369","Adverse and beneficial lock-in;cost efficiency;economic analysis;quality;services sampling;software-as-a-service (SaaS);strategy;switching costs;vendor competition","Costs;Economics;Software as a service;Subscriptions","DP industry;cloud computing;decision making;game theory;pricing;profitability","IT services;SaaS clients;SaaS competition;application functionality;client switching cost;decision-making;game-theoretic model;lock-in risk;pricing strategy;profitability;quality strategy;software-as-a-service vendors;vendor software work","","3","","50","","","20140716","Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In parallel, other studies indicate that the emergence of agile methods in the 90s led to the formation of high performance teams with great level of knowledge in technical, business and behavioral domains. For this reason, we have proposed a training method called Software Kaizen, which provides temporary immersion of a team in a high-performance environment, based on agile methodologies.

The Antennas and Propagation Society (AP-S) played a key leadership role in using computers and software tools to stimulate and support the teaching and learning of electromagnetics. Through a grant from the National Science Foundation in late 1980s that AP-S was able to unify much of the ongoing individualized efforts and further motivate the use of innovative multimedia modules, virtual laboratories, and software tools in electromagnetic education. During this period, the Computer Applications for Electromagnetic Education (CAEME) Center was established and through the remarkable vision of the AP-S leadership including Dr. Iren Peden, Dr. David Chang, and late Professor Robert E.

It is estimated that the loss due to phishing in 2012 was over $1.5 billion. The recommended defense against phishing attacks is to educate a user how not to fall for them. Such campaigns are not the most effective solution, and software systems has been created to identify phishing emails. By and large, these systems are crisp. In this paper, we will report on human perception in identifying phishing emails and apply the fuzzy analysis to the experiment results in order to show that a fuzzy system is much more appropriate for dealing with identification of such emails. We will also demonstrate the system's acceptability to a human user.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4562-7; POD:978-1-4799-4561-0","10.1109/NORBERT.2014.6893870","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6893870","computer phishing detection;fuzzy phlishing detection;human phishing detection;human-computer collaboration","Computers;Electronic mail;Machine learning algorithms;Natural languages;Pragmatics;Psychology;Semantics","data privacy;fuzzy set theory;unsolicited e-mail","fuzzy analysis;fuzzy system;human judgment;human perception;machine uncertainty;phishing attacks;phishing email identification;private data elicitation;social engineering","","0","","68","","","","24-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The solution is to provide environments for such hands-on sessions and homework, but this raises numerous difficulties. The environment must be: (i) multi-platform (Mac OS, Linux, Windows) so as to enable student practice at home, (ii) easy to deploy, (iii) easy to use and to take charge of, and (iv) flexible enough to enable the integration of new notations and associated services. CosyVerif is a software environment dedicated to graphical notations, that provides the mechanisms and means for an easy integration of additional existing software for teaching (or demonstration) purposes. This makes it an interesting platform to establish new courses. This paper presents our experience using CosyVerif for teaching Petri nets and parametric timed automata in two universities of the Paris region, i.e. Université Pierre et Marie Curie, and Université Paris 13.

The result has been highly fragmented curricula consisting of various disconnected theory courses and laboratory practicals. A holistic approach to curricula development that focuses on integrated fundamental knowledge is required to remedy this. This paper proposes a holistic approach to developing a CpE curriculum and to maintaining continuous, coherent development of that curriculum. The elements of the proposed approach are the following: formulation of objectives, identification of major curriculum areas, construction of a system model for CpE core courses by using the Y-chart methodology, description of electives, integration of laboratory practices, and assessment of the curriculum. An assessment of the curriculum is presented based on survey data and accreditation outcomes.

"On the Domain-Specificity of Mindsets: The Relationship Between Aptitude Beliefs and Programming Practice","M. J. Scott; G. Ghinea","Sch. of Inf. Syst., Comput. & Math., Brunel Univ., Uxbridge, UK","IEEE Transactions on Education","20140731","2014","57","3","169","174","Deliberate practice is important in many areas of learning, including that of learning to program computers. However, beliefs about the nature of personal traits, known as mindsets, can have a profound impact on such practice. Previous research has shown that those with a fixed mindset believe their traits cannot change; they tend to reduce their level of practice when they encounter difficulty. In contrast, those with the growth mindset believe their traits are flexible; they tend to maintain regular practice despite the level of difficulty. However, focusing on mindset as a single construct focused on intelligence may not be appropriate in the field of computer programming. Exploring this notion, a self-belief survey was distributed to undergraduate software engineering students. It revealed that beliefs about intelligence and programming aptitude formed two distinct constructs. Furthermore, the mindset for programming aptitude had greater utility in predicting software development practice, and a follow-up survey showed that it became more fixed throughout instruction. Thus, educators should consider the role of programming-specific beliefs in the design and evaluation of introductory courses in software engineering. In particular, they need to situate and contextualize the growth messages that motivate students who experience early setbacks.","0018-9359;00189359","","10.1109/TE.2013.2288700","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6662493","Domain-specific;Dweck;implicit beliefs;mindsets;practice;programming;self-theories","Computers;Data models;Educational institutions;Programming profession;Software engineering","computer science education;educational courses;further education;psychology;software engineering","computer programming;intelligence;introductory courses;mindset domain-specificity;programming aptitude beliefs;programming practice;programming-specific beliefs;software development practice;undergraduate software engineering students","","2","","35","","","20131112","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, it comes to a consensus that there is not any specific tracker that works sufficiently well under all circumstances. Therefore, one potential solution is to deploy multiple trackers, with a tracker output fusion step to boost the overall performance. Subsequently, an intelligent fusion design, yet general and orthogonal to any specific tracker, plays a key role in successful tracking. In this paper, we propose a symbiotic tracker ensemble toward a unified tracking framework, which is based on only the output of each individual tracker, without knowing its specific mechanism. In our approach, all trackers run in parallel, without requiring any details for tracker running, which means that all trackers are treated as black boxes. The proposed symbiotic tracker ensemble framework aims at learning an optimal combination of these tracking results. Our method captures the relation among individual trackers robustly from two aspects. First, the consistency between two successive frames is calculated for each tracker. Then, the pair-wise correlation among different trackers is estimated in the new coming frame by a graph-propagation process. Experimental results on the Caremedia dataset and the Caviar dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, with comparisons to several state-of-the-art methods.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2302366","985 Project of Xiamen University; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Key Technologies Research and Development Program of China Foundation; Nature Science Foundation of China; Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6720135","Graph propagation;object tracking;tracking fusion","Correlation;Educational institutions;Estimation;Surveillance;Symbiosis;Target tracking;Visualization","graph theory;image fusion;object tracking;video surveillance","Caremedia dataset;Caviar dataset;black boxes;graph-propagation process;intelligent fusion design;object tracking;pair-wise correlation;people tracking;successive frames;symbiotic tracker ensemble framework;tracker output fusion step;unified tracking framework;video surveillance systems","","17","","33","","","20140123","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

On the other hand, for each edge block, we use its texture and disparity gradients for the distortion model. In addition, we formulate a bit-rate allocation problem in terms of the quantization parameters for texture and depth data. By solving the problem, we can optimally divide a limited bit budget between the texture and depth data, in order to maximize the qualities of synthesized virtual views, as well as those of encoded real views.

A good software designer requires both the acquisition of theory and practice of skills under the guidance of a lecturer. However, this is not feasible in the conventional classroom learning setting. The amount of contact hours between the lecturers and students is very limited. Hence, it constrains the amount of guidance and learning that students may obtain in a course. Thus, we propose a software design critiquing tool to support the students in practicing the software design problems/exercises. The aim of this paper is to describe the use of a critiquing-based approach in a software design tool for supporting the teaching and learning of a software design course.

This common introductory robotics course generally covers the fundamental theory of robotics including robot kinematics, dynamics, differential movements, trajectory planning and basic computer vision algorithms commonly used in the field of robotics. The nature of this material almost necessitates the use of robotic hardware to allow the students to practice implementing the theory they learn in class. That is, to fully understand the material, it is necessary for the students to implement algorithms and observe the results on hardware.

The software simulates the geometry of motion (kinematics) of a two link robotic arm and is used by students to implement algorithms based on the robot's kinematic equations. This includes the use of inverse kinematic equations used to determine the joint inputs based on the desired location of the end-effector, as well as trajectory planning and the study of differential movements. It also include a robotic image processing tool that helps the student design robotic vision algorithms.

The necessity to expand the computing curriculum across a wider range of schools and university courses for students who are not majoring in Computer Science (CS) ) it is well-documented in literature [1], as is the difficulty of teaching 21st century skills (www.p21.org. This work presents an educational approach to teaching initial programming based on the development of fundamental and transversal skills and computer science skills, including creative and computational thinking as well as problem solving and critical thinking. The approach is based on cutting-edge educational tools, namely the visual programming frameworks Scratch, AppInventor, BYOB, and the well-known C/C++ language; curriculum material is drawn from CSPrinciples pilot courses, CS unplugged, school level preparation material for the International Olympiad in Informatics, and are complemented by supplementary information. The pedagogical approaches used in the course are based on constructivist learning theory, experiential learning and guided inquiry. This paper presents a year-long teaching experience in a 10<sup>th</sup>/13<sup>th</sup> grade high school with 14 to 16-year-old students. Ways to extend the experience to a university course are also presented.

In this study, we quantitatively and qualitatively investigate how personal characteristics and the learning process of team members affect educational effectiveness by examining a university course in which students work in teams on a realistic project in a classroom setting. We use the Five Factors and Stress (FFS) theory and the modified grounded theory approach (M-GTA) to measure the personal characteristics and to identify the learning process of each team member. Additionally, we compare the learning process of a team with a high educational effectiveness to one with a low educational effectiveness based on number of topics about the learning process and the kind of topics. As a result, we find that it is better for a team to have members with different personal characteristic as defined by FFS theory in order for the students to acquire more knowledge and skills through the course. Additionally, teams that focus on fewer learning process topics acquire more knowledge and skills. We expect that our findings will help increase the educational effectiveness in similar practical courses.","1093-0175;10930175","Electronic:978-1-4799-4970-0; POD:978-1-4799-4969-4","10.1109/CSEET.2014.6816789","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816789","","Business;Educational institutions;Interviews;Process control;Statistical analysis;Stress","computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;project management;software engineering;team working","FFS theory;M-GTA;classroom setting;controlled-project based learning;educational effectiveness;five factors and stress theory;learning process;modified grounded theory approach;optimal team composition;personal characteristics;realistic project;software intensive systems development;software-intensive business systems;student knowledge;student skills;systems acquisition;systems provisioning;team members;teamwork;university course","","5","","15","","","","23-25 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For various reasons, however, university students encounter difficulties in understanding the role of requirements and appropriately applying relevant methods to deal with requirements. This paper describes the concept for teaching requirements engineering that was devised at Coburg University of Applied Sciences. As a key idea, teaching requirements starts out from business process models. From these models, requirements for a workflow application can be derived and specified in a requirements document. A main benefit of this approach lies in the fact that requirements are not just presented as an abstract concept. Furthermore, students are exposed to the complexity of an almost realistic workflow application. Being more realistic than a toy project, the latter also improves understanding why requirements should be described precisely and provides opportunities to also exercise non-technical competencies that are important for successful requirements engineering.","1093-0175;10930175","Electronic:978-1-4799-4970-0; POD:978-1-4799-4969-4","10.1109/CSEET.2014.6816776","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816776","","Abstracts;Business;Complexity theory;Educational institutions;Software;Unified modeling language","computer science education;educational courses;further education;software quality;teaching","Coburg University of Applied Sciences;abstract concept;business process models;requirements engineering;software system quality;teaching requirements;university students;workflow application","","5","","22","","","","23-25 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Access to the simulated world can either be through a computer terminal connected to the World Wide Web or through an application running on an Android platform.

First, most modeling tools used seemingly esoteric notations that were hurdles for many students. Even if the notation could be tamed, the tools themselves were rarely more than syntax checkers, possibly with support for simple expression evaluation. Venturing beyond this requires understanding of proof theories and strategies well beyond that typical of other engineering disciplines. What is more, the tools worked at a much lower level than that of the domain itself; it was easy for students to miss the forest for the trees. The development and release of the Alloy from MIT has improved the situation dramatically. With Alloy, instructors now have a tool that supports formal structural and behavioral modeling (using C-like syntax), along with state space exploration and property verification using relational logic, predicates, and assertions The tradeoff involved - only first order systems over finite domains can be analyzed - is not problematic in practice. The workshop will introduce Alloy - both the language and support tool - to faculty interested in formal methods and mathematical modeling. After a brief introduction to Alloy concepts, the tool and language will be explored by interactively developing a simple software system model.

Do our graduate students have evaluation skills needed to work at the most advanced level of Bloom's taxonomy? Can they learn to frame and solve the problems within complex industry environments while applying the current research? How do we structure a graduate curriculum and an environment that provides experiences in innovation within the constraints of the academic calendar? Here we present an interdisciplinary curriculum comprised of three components: a service interaction blueprint for framing the industry problem, agile principles focusing on aspects of the solution, and Christensen's theory-building to frame the next iteration of research. The environment for industry problems was created through an National Science Funded Industry & University Cooperative Research Center.

When software is modified from one version to another, its architecture may change. Software modification involving architectural change is often difficult when the change goes beyond the original architectural design, involving changes to the connectivity of multiple components. Existing research has looked at architectural change at the level of architecture metrics such as size, complexity, coupling and cohesion, which abstract a particular version of the software in isolation. In this paper, we argue that this level of abstraction is often too high to characterize some interesting aspects of the architectural change process, and propose an approach that takes into account the change in connectivity from version to version of individual components. In this approach, two endpoints of a major change are taken as reference points, and intermediate connectivity changes are examined relative to the endpoints. We define a distance measure between software structures using a graph kernel function, which is quite powerful as it is applicable to any software structure representable as a graph. Using this distance measure, we define a metric which models the architecture change as a transition between two endpoints. In addition to theoretical analysis of the approach, we present empirical results obtained by applying the approach to open-source software projects to evaluate its validity and usefulness","1530-1435;15301435","POD:0-7695-2371-4","10.1109/METRICS.2005.35","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1509302","","Appraisal;Computer industry;Decision making;Education;Educational institutions;Industrial training;Laboratories;Programming;Software engineering;Software maintenance","configuration management;graph theory;object-oriented programming;public domain software;software architecture;software maintenance;software metrics","architectural change;architectural design;architecture metrics;component connectivity;component relationship;graph kernel function;open-source software projects;software architecture;software metrics;software modification;software structure;software version;structural distance;system structure","","9","","","","","","19-22 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The components including the microcontroller with programmer are inexpensive. It gives a hands-on experience to the undergraduate student of Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) and Computer Science Engineering (CSE), Post-Graduate students with electronics major. The salient feature of this module is that each experiment is explained by its hardware description, software development which includes dumping the hex file of the program on to the microcontroller's flash memory. Our experience with the conduct of a 120 min-end of semester practical examination show that, with the chronological increase in hardware design, the student exhibited the confidence in designing new stand-alone systems with fairly complicated hardware and software.

The intention behind gamifying the course was to increase student engagement and motivation by allowing for independent learning with flexible speed and choice of emphasis. Daniel Pink's [3] motivational theory, which is also found in gamification factors, outlines that autonomy, mastery and purpose lead to these goals. The adopted approach also deals nicely with the vast differences regarding background knowledge and the spread of interest of each of the students. During the latter part of the course a student survey was conducted. Out of 90 students, 59 answered. As a general rule, students did not receive the gamification ideas in a positive light.

Software systems maintain several types of log files for different purposes. For example, a system may maintain logs for debugging, monitoring application performance, and/or tracking user access to system resources. The objective of my research is to develop and validate a minimum set of log file attributes and software security metrics for user nonrepudiation by measuring the degree to which a given audit log file captures the data necessary to allow for meaningful forensic analysis of user behavior within the software system. For a log to enable user nonrepudiation, the log file must record certain data fields, such as a unique user identifier. The log must also record relevant user activity, such as creating, viewing, updating, and deleting system resources, as well as software security events, such as the addition or revocation of user privileges. Using a grounded theory method, I propose a methodology for observing the current state of activity logging mechanisms in healthcare, education, and finance, then I quantify differences between activity logs and logs not specifically intended to capture user activity. I will then propose software security metrics for quantifying the forensic-ability of log files. I will evaluate my work with empirical analysis by comparing the performance of my metrics on several types of log files, including both activity logs and logs not directly intended to record user activity.

The collaborative-development tools through which student developers define, share and manage their tasks generate a detailed record in the process. Albeit not designed for this purpose, this record can provide the instructor with insights into the students' work, the team's progress over time, and the individual team-member's contributions. In this paper, we describe an analysis and visualization toolkit that enables instructors to interactively explore the trace of the team's collaborative work, to better understand the team dynamics, and the tasks of the individual team developers. We also discuss our grounded-theory analysis of one team's work, based on their email exchanges, questionnaires and interviews. Our analyses suggest that the inferences supported by our toolkit are congruent with the developers' feedback, while there are some discrepancies with the reflections of the team as a whole.","1093-0175;10930175","Electronic:978-1-4673-5140-9; POD:978-1-4673-5138-6","10.1109/CSEET.2013.6595236","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6595236","","Collaboration;Data visualization;Electronic mail;History;Interviews;Software;Software engineering","computer aided instruction;computer science education;data visualisation;educational courses;groupware;software engineering","collaborative-development tool;grounded-theory analysis;software development;software-engineering courses;student software teams;team dynamics;team-based activity;visualization toolkit","","2","","9","","","","19-21 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Further, they are built around the Texas Instrument's low-power RISC microcontroller MSP430F149, which supports modular programming. The components including the microcontroller with programmer are inexpensive. It gives a hands-on experience to the undergraduate student of electronics and communication engineering (ECE) and computer science engineering (CSE). The salient feature of this module is that each experiment is explained by its hardware description, software development which includes the dumping of program on to the microcontroller's flash memory. Program listing is made available on request. The compiler necessary for program development is available as freeware from Texas instrument's website. It can be used to develop 4kB of program which is fairly sufficient for the experiments described herein. Our experience with the conduct of a 120 min-end of semester practical examination show that, with the chronological increase in hardware design, the student exhibited the confidence in designing new stand-alone systems with fairly complicated hardware and software.

This behavioral distance provides a quantitative analogue of bisimilarity and is defined as the greatest fixed point of a suitable monotonic function. The behavioral distance has the important property that two systems are at zero distance if and only if they are bisimilar. Moreover, for any given threshold, we find that systems with behavioral distances bounded by the threshold are equivalent. In addition, we show that two system combinators-parallel composition and product-are nonexpansive with respect to our behavioral distance, which makes compositional verification possible. The theory developed here is applicable to the quantitative verification, approximate reduction, and reliability analysis of fuzzy-transition systems.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2230177","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6362199","Behavioral distance;bisimulation;fuzzy automaton;fuzzy-transition system (FTS);nonexpansiveness;pseudo-ultrametric","Automata;Educational institutions;Equations;Fuzzy systems;Lattices;Measurement;Robustness","automata theory;fuzzy set theory","approximate reduction;behavioral distance;behavioral similarity;compositional verification;fuzzy automata;fuzzy systems;fuzzy transition systems;monotonic function;parallel composition;quantitative verification;robust notion;zero distance","","12","","52","","","20121127","Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The application of Matlab/Simulink-Stateflow is developed for simulating, learning and analysing of power electronic systems. Stateflow is a tool provided in Matlab that allows us to use the concepts of FSM that is widely being used by electronic engineers for designing purposes. With the help of its graphical user interface and some basic knowledge of circuit theories, the corresponding SIMULINK models of the switching converter circuits can be easily constructed. The most powerful feature of Stateflow which is not provided by most of the softwares is the ability to animate and also that it has got many handful tools for debugging. Both of these properties helps the students to clearly visualize and analyse the power electronic systems in a much effective manner. Students can actually see how the system would behave and at what instant of time which state is active, how the transitions are working and we can also see the value of the outputs at any particular instant of time.

Specific problems include: The prevalence of fads more typical of the fashion industry than an engineering discipline; a huge number of methods and method variants, with differences little understood and artificially magnified; the lack of credible experimental evaluation and validation; and the split between industry practice and academic research. At the root of the problems we lack a sound, widely accepted theoretical basis. A prime example of such a basis is Maxwell's equations in electrical engineering. It is difficult to fathom what electrical engineering would be today without those four concise equations. They are a great example to the statement “There is nothing so practical as a good theory”. In software engineering we have nothing similar, and there is widespread doubt whether it is needed. This talk will argue for the need of a basic theory in software engineering, a theory identifying its pure essence, its common ground or its kernel. The Semat (Software Engineering Methods and Theory) community addresses this huge challenge. It supports a process to refound software engineering based on a kernel of widely-agreed elements, extensible for specific uses, addressing both technology and people issues. This kernel represents the essence of software engineering. This talk promises to make you see the light in the tunnel.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-1204-2; POD:978-1-4503-1204-2","10.1145/2351676.2351679","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494901","Kernel;activity space;alpha;education;method;practice;software engineering theory;status of SEMAT","","software engineering","Maxwell equations;SEMAT;Software Engineering Methods and Theory;electrical engineering;fad prevalence;fashion industry","","0","","17","","","","3-7 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover in this paper, an algorithm for one way hash function construction based on chaos theory is introduced. The proposed hash function operates on messages with arbitrary length to produce 128 bits hash value and can be easily implemented in both hardware and software. The two core characteristics of the recommended algorithm are chaotic behaviors and parallel processing mode. The proposed algorithm contains controllable parameters dynamically obtained from the position index of the corresponding message blocks. Theoretical analysis and computer simulation indicate that the algorithm can assure all performance conditions of hash function in an efficient and flexible style and secure against several attacks, which is good choice for data integrity or authentication.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2073-3; POD:978-1-4673-2072-6","10.1109/ISTEL.2012.6483140","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6483140","Chaotic nonlinear map;Circle Chord Method;Hash function;Spatiotemporal chaos;Two-dimensional chaos map lattices;variable parameter","Algorithm design and analysis;Chaotic communication;Cryptography;Sensitivity;Spatiotemporal phenomena","chaos;cryptography;data integrity;parallel processing","2D chaotic maps;chaos theory;circle chord methods;computer simulation;data authentication;data integrity;dynamic chaotic hash function;parallel processing;word length 128 bit","","4","","16","","","","6-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To keep up this trend, as well as the pace with the rapid advancement of software technologies, the Advanced Network Technologies Virtual Lab (ANT VLab) has been developed by us at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India. This lab exposes students to various advanced topics including Wi-Fi, WiMAX, Satellite Networks, Mobile Adhoc Networks (MANETs), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Bluetooth, Zigbee, and encourages them to work on related problems in a partially constrained environment. Apart from providing detailed theory on each topic, each virtual experiment in the lab has a set of exercises to be solved using remote network simulations. Network Simulator-2 (NS-2) / Mannasim framework and Network Simulator-3 (NS-3) have been used for this purpose. The ANT VLab also offers benefits such as reduced software and hardware costs as against setting up an actual advanced network technology lab, improved learning by interactive visualization, and self-learning advanced network technologies in the absence of a real-life instructor. Additionally, the students can interface and learn at their own pace any time and from any place having a PC with high speed Internet connectivity. WSNs is an emerging field in computer networking.

Facilitating student work in a potentially unfamiliar setting has a steep learning curve and requires professors to relinquish control of their classrooms without assurance their career evaluations will benefit. However, professors who do transform their teaching practices continue to report exactly the same concerns - so how does the sage-to-guide shift occur? This work-in-progress paper describes early efforts in a grounded theory study whose initial participants are professors who have involved their classes in open software, hardware, and content communities, a choice which requires such a shift in teaching practices for successful student participation. Inspired by the radical transparency of the open communities our participants work with, the study itself is an open content project, creating a public compendium of teaching transformation stories that can be accessed by educators considering similar transformations to their own teaching practices.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4673-1352-0; POD:978-1-4673-1353-7; USB:978-1-4673-1351-3","10.1109/FIE.2012.6462252","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6462252","free and open source software (FOSS);grounded theory;storytelling;teaching open source","Communities;Educational institutions;Interviews;Open source software;Sociology;USA Councils","computer science education;teaching","career evaluation;content community class;grounded theory study;hardware class;open community participation;open software class;radical transparency;student participation;teaching practice;teaching transformation story","","1","","9","","","","3-6 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Simulation games are an appropriate complementary approach to the traditional educational techniques. Students' preparation can be improved by allowing them to practice, through a simulator, activities that are infeasible to practice during a Software Engineering course, due to restrictions of time and resources. Unfortunately, the creation of a simulation game is not a straightforward activity; it involves many different skills and addresses different viewpoints. In this work, we discuss the issues and challenges associated with the creation process of a Software Engineering simulation game.

The students are usually able to perform sequences of the underlying calculations but cannot piece together the higher conceptual relationship that drives these procedures. This work-in-progress paper presents a viable approach and a new teaching and learning paradigm to enhance the effectiveness of teaching fast Fourier transform and significantly improve the learning outcomes. By integrating the mobile and cloud computing technologies, we are developing a handheld real-world relevance laboratory that includes an integrated learning module for Fourier transform and a shared intelligent project repository to host the module and real-world relevant data. This development is expected to overcome the intellectual inaccessibility of transform techniques and tackle the challenges in existing approaches: the prohibitive cost of project-based approach; limited access and real-world relevance data in simulation-based approach, and unreliable and unsustainable support.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4673-1352-0; POD:978-1-4673-1353-7; USB:978-1-4673-1351-3","10.1109/FIE.2012.6462230","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6462230","Fast Fourier transform;interactive analysis;mobile device;real-world relevance","Computers;Education;Fast Fourier transforms;Laboratories;Mobile communication","cloud computing;computer aided instruction;fast Fourier transforms;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;teaching","cloud computing technologies;engineering students;fast Fourier transform;handheld real-world relevance laboratory;integrated learning module;mobile computing technologies;multifaceted penetration;real-world objects;real-world relevant data;shared intelligent project repository;symbolic mathematical representation;teaching paradigm","","1","","8","","","","3-6 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Educational software tool for signals and systems theory","J. H. Juesas; E. Gago-Ribas; S. M.

Taking into account the connection of the SST with the algebraic representation and the mathematical understanding of physical problems - electromagnetic radiation, scattering and inverse problems in our particular case -, a generalized scheme of the SST (GSST) is currently under development. While the usual point of view of classical SST is valid for practical purposes, it usually avoids many important concepts which become fundamental in the generalization of the analysis of physical problems. Some examples of this generalization are concerned with representations of physical problems different from those in the usual time-frequency domains - using a general variable -, the description of the problem in terms of infinite dimensional vector spaces and the algebra associated, the description of the Dirac delta function in terms of the distribution theory, etc. The most important purpose of obtaining a GSST is to connect the usual SST with important mathematical representations that lead to obtain more general representations that may be rigorously applied to model general physical problems. This generalized theory is focused on the algebraic concepts of signals and operators spaces, identifying each problem into their corresponding vector spaces and representing it in terms of the GSST scheme. One important point within this generalization is the concept of the Generalized Transform. Choosing a set of functions which play the role of a base, each signal of the space may be expressed in terms of a Generalized Linear Combination operator of this base weighted by a set of coefficients which identify the transform - their expression is directly related to the metric defined initially in the associated algebra -. Spectral analysis of systems is also contemplated, representing the s- gnals in terms of their coefficients once a set of basis functions is chosen. The generalized theory let to obtain integral characterizations of linear systems - invariant and non invariant -, leading to the Generalized Spectral Analysis concept, closely connected to the operator theory. While the mathematical analysis of the GSST and its application, for instance to generalize the Green's function theory, has already been presented in several symposium - like 2009 IEEE AP and URSI Meeting -, a software tool based on the GSST is being worked out in parallel to the theoretical works. The aim of this tool is to facilitate both students and practical scientific and engineers the understanding of the main algebraic concepts of this generalized scheme, providing some examples of many signals and many systems in five different signal spaces. The user can select the signal and the system with their appropriate parameters and analyze the properties of the systems as well as the output signal both in real and different spectral domains. The last version of this tool, SSTv4.5, lets to analyze linear non invariant systems and to visualize the set of impulse responses as well as the spectral analysis under some transformations such as Fourier, Hilbert or Bessel Transforms - depending on the signal space -, thus exemplifying some particular cases of the Generalized Spectral Analysis. The description of the current version of this software tool is presented in this paper.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4673-1352-0; POD:978-1-4673-1353-7; USB:978-1-4673-1351-3","10.1109/FIE.2012.6462421","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6462421","Infinite dimensions — countable or continuous;Linear — invariant and non invariant — Systems;Operators;Signal Theory;Software Tool","Fourier transforms;Software tools;Spectral analysis;Vectors;Visualization","computer aided instruction;electrical engineering computing;electrical engineering education;electromagnetic wave propagation;electromagnetic wave scattering;inverse problems;signal processing;software tools;spectral analysis;time-frequency analysis;transforms;transient response","Dirac delta function;GSST scheme;Green's function theory;SSTv4.5;algebraic representation;algebraic signals concepts;classical SST;distribution theory;educational background;educational software tool;electrical engineering;electromagnetic radiation;electromagnetic scattering;generalized linear combination;generalized spectral analysis concept;generalized transform;impulse responses;infinite dimensional vector spaces;inverse problems;linear non invariant systems;mathematical analysis;mathematical representations;mathematical understanding;physical problems;signal spaces;signals and systems theory;spectral analysis;spectral domains;time-frequency domains","","0","","15","","","","3-6 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Particularly public-key cryptography is often a challenge to teach and understand without detailed examples and the possibility to implement an algorithm to really see how it works. However, most of the arithmetic appearing in cryptography is not directly supported by the common programming languages, and usually buried within complicated libraries. Software tools that natively support cryptographic operations are rare and most teaching in this area must be done with general purpose software like computer algebra systems. In this work, we report on a newly developed software system called SUNSET, which provides a programming language that natively supports operations within finite fields, rings and modulo groups. It has been explicitly designed for usage within classrooms and for rapid prototyping of cryptographic protocols. Contrary to many computer algebra systems and conventional programming languages, it does not require reference to external libraries or add-on packages, and lets a student implement a cryptographic algorithm in a way almost as it is printed in the papers.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2427-4; POD:978-1-4673-2425-0; USB:978-1-4673-2426-7","10.1109/ICL.2012.6402036","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6402036","algebra;computer algebra system;cryptography;e-Learning;programming language;teaching","Arrays;Computer languages;Cryptography;Galois fields;Polynomials;Zinc","computer aided instruction;computer science education;cryptographic protocols;number theory;process algebra;public key cryptography;software engineering;teaching","SUNSET-FFAPL;computer science;cryptographic operations;cryptographic protocols;cryptography teaching;e-Learning;integrated development environment;modulo arithmetic;number theory;programming language;public-key cryptography;software system development;software tools","","0","","10","","","","26-28 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Though the course starts with RE theory from elicitation via documentation and traceability, we found that the students find it difficult to combine different RE artifact types and to develop useful traces between them. In this paper we present an approach to provide feedback and give pro-active advice inside an RE tool, while the specification is created. To derive this feedback we use a knowledge base containing rules and best practices to create a requirements specification. An assistance system applies these rules to guide the user in different situations, beginning with an empty specification up to the implementation of various RE artifact types and traces between them.

For example, in these years, there are many road accidental injuries to the students in HEMC; most of them are cyclists, for bicycle is the main traffic vehicle of campus students. This paper summarizes four main factors that influence the cyclist safety in campus: slope gradient, road curvature, the distance approaches to the intersections and other special factors (like rainy day) that contribute to the road risk. By using of S-type function in Fuzzy Mathematics, the forward three main risk factors are quantified and normalized, and a comprehensive safety evaluation model for cyclist is established. The east campus of Sun Yat-sen University in GZ HEMC has been used as an application of the road risk distribution model. With the help of GIS software, all risk values of points in road are interpolated through sample points by DTM function, and the risk DTM is overlaid on the remote sensing image of the same area. Finally a risk distribution map along road for cyclists of campus in sunny days is created, so does in rainy days. Through field based interviews, we can prove that risk distribution map is in accord with realistic bicycle crash locations, it can serve as a basis reference for improving cyclist safety in campus of HEMC, as well as a safety information and guidance for students.","2153-0009;21530009","Electronic:978-1-4673-3063-3; POD:978-1-4673-3064-0; USB:978-1-4673-3062-6","10.1109/ITSC.2012.6338868","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6338868","","Bicycles;Educational institutions;Road safety;Safety","bicycles;educational institutions;further education;fuzzy set theory;geographic information systems;remote sensing;risk management;road accidents;road safety;traffic engineering computing","China;DTM function;GIS software;S-type function;Sun Yat-sen University;bicycle crash location;campus;cyclist safety;fuzzy mathematics;higher education mega center;remote sensing image;risk distribution map;road accidental injuries;road curvature;road risk distribution model;road safety evaluation model;road traffic;slope gradient","","0","","15","","","","16-19 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This style of service provisioning enables users to freely move between geographical areas and to continuously access information and conduct online transactions. However, such a high mobility may cause performance and reliability problems during the execution of transactions. For example, the unavailability of sufficient bandwidth can result in failure of transactions when users move from one area (cell) to another. We present a context-aware transaction model that dynamically adapts to the users' needs and execution environments. Accordingly, we develop a new mobility management scheme that ensures seamless connectivity and reliable execution of context-aware transactions during mobility of users. The proposed scheme is designed and developed using a combination of different queuing models. We conduct various experiments in order to show that the proposed scheme optimizes the mobility management process and increases the throughput of context-aware transactions.","0278-0046;02780046","","10.1109/TIE.2012.2198032","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6195011","Context-aware transactions;cyberspace;handover;mobile;mobility management;pervasive","Computer architecture;Context;Insurance;Mobile handsets;Mobile radio mobility management;Protocols","information retrieval;mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio);queueing theory;transaction processing","anywhere-anytime service provisioning;bandwidth availability;commerce;context-aware transaction;continuous information access;education;embedded devices;engineering;entertainment;execution environment;execution reliability;geographical area;handoff;handover;mobile cyberspace;mobile device;mobility management scheme;online transaction;performance problem;pervasive cyberspace;queuing model;reliability problem;seamless connectivity;software system;transaction execution;user mobility;user needs;wireless network","","7","","23","","","20120504","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Students generally tend to focus more on coding phase of the project, since the misconception is that a large code constitutes good software. Unlike other branches of engineering, the engineering processes are not visible here. Further, management of large number of student projects poses a challenge in terms of guidance, progress monitoring and assessment. The student projects are observed to be ending up incomplete and are rarely deployed. The feedback from industry side also speaks about the gaps in terms of these skills. A mini project course for fifth semester is designed in the undergraduate programme in Computer Science and Engineering to address the lacunae observed above by tightly integrating it with the theory course on Software engineering. The focus of the mini project is not on what the problem definition is, instead it is on how it is done. The implementation plan addressed the issues and challenges listed above faced by the faculty. Assessment rubrics are written to guarantee proper understanding of the expectations among the stake holders resulting in fair assessment. This approach improved students understandability in Software engineering concepts and also the quality of their capstone projects.

This is particularly so in terms of making the students industry ready by exposing them to the processes and practices of life cycle activities of software development. The traditional approach to teaching the course on Software Engineering has not been able to make a positive impact on learning because: the course instructors mostly lack exposure to industry practices, the course material being referred while teaching the course fails to establish the context as the case studies referred are alien to the students and assessment focusing mainly on memory oriented questions. Thus teaching the course on Software Engineering has got reduced to monotonous lecturing, in the absence of experience and case studies. An attempt to address the issues referred above is made by the authors. The theory course on Software Engineering was redesigned by tightly coupling a Mini project course with it. Different activities are designed along with Class room teaching to make Software Engineering as joyful course for the students.

Teaching the course on finite automata and formal languages is challenging because there are difficulties in understanding the formal language and automata theory concepts as the course is mathematical in nature. In addition, the conventional approach to the course followed a sequence of machine and then the corresponding language theory. The standard textbooks also recommended the same approach. The authors observe that this approach has failed to establish the context required for the study. A new approach to teaching the course on Formal Languages and Automata Theory is attempted by the authors. The course structure is redesigned to teach formal languages and corresponding automata followed by the properties of the respective languages according to the hierarchy of the formal languages. This flow of teaching makes students to understand the concepts and relate to the real time applications easily. Activity oriented teaching learning was attempted in the course and a tutorial was introduced for this course with an objective of increasing student participation. Group activities were attempted in tutorials which enhanced peer learning. Course assessment was done in terms of regular minor exams, quizzes based on GATE format and presentations.

The indicators comparisons between single-queue and multi-queues have been made; it could be found that the indicators of single-queue queuing system were better than those of the multi-queues system. What's more, on the basis of single-queue, according to the simulation experiments in BF-BOF region of a steel plant, the queuing simulation systems which were used to describe the relationships among the numbers of HMCL (hot metal charging ladle) s in cycle, production capacity and average waiting time were studied. The results imply that the type of queuing and HMCLs in cycle have effects on the waiting time and production capacity.

When knowing where the reason lies, we propose an algorithm which can enable the nodes to choose their transmission range and next hop relay in order to adjust energy consumption of nodes in different position of the network. With this ability nodes that have less energy can reduce their work, so do the nodes in the region nearer the sink, thus the lifetime of the network can be prolonged. At last we evaluate this algorithm by means of the NS2 stimulation tools, and the simulation result shows that we finally get a network with relatively longer lifetime.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2108-2; POD:978-1-4673-2109-9","10.1109/ITiME.2012.6291451","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6291451","NS2;TSMP;WSN;energy-hole problem;lifetime of network","Educational institutions","graph theory;mathematical analysis;protocols;telecommunication network routing","adjusting transmission range;collision free network;cycling;energy hole problem;graph routing;mathematical analysis;next hop relay;pairwise communication;routing graph;time synchronization;time synchronized mesh protocol network lifetime","","0","","13","","","","3-5 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose an intelligent framework for monitoring individual or group performance during activity and problem based learning tasks. The system can be used to more effectively evaluate new teaching approaches and methodologies, identify weaknesses and provide more personalised feedback on learner's progress. We present a case study and initial experiments in which we apply the fuzzy LS technique for analysing the effectiveness of using a Group Performance Model (GPM) to deploy Activity Led Learning (ALL) in a Master-level module.

By employing the impedance boundary condition (IBC), the modified UTD solution for a convex impedance cylinder can be used for the material-coated PEC cylinder problem. Thus, the modified UTD solution for a convex impedance cylinder surface requires the surface impedance value (Z<sub>S</sub>). In this paper, the study of the limitation of approximated closed form of Z<sub>S</sub> is presented. The thickness of thin material-coated PEC cylinder will be investigated in terms of the ratio of material-coated thickness to radius of the cylinder. The mean squared error (MSE) between the modified UTD results and the reference results obtained from CST-Microwave Studio program is performed to investigate limitation of closed form of Z<sub>S</sub>. The relative permittivity ε<sub>r</sub> of a material-coated PEC cylinder in this paper is fixed to 4.

Sufficient conditions that ensure the existence of observers for one-sided Lipschitz non-linear systems are established and expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which are easily and numerically tractable via standard software algorithms. It is shown that the proposed conditions are less conservative and more simpler than some existing results in recent literature.

Statistical analysis indicates that their enumeration of software processes in the post condition is very significantly richer than in the pre condition. They also gave significantly more responses about requirements, design, and engineering management in the post condition.

These circuits can only be explained on a theoretical level or require expensive and specialized equipment. The traditional teaching of electronics based on discrete components or LSI integrated circuits as logic gates or flip-flops is being clearly outdated, and runs the risk of creating a gap between theory and practice that goes against the spirit of professional training. This article presents a hardware and software set of components designed for advanced electronic practices whose centerpiece is a microcontroller that connects different peripherals such as analog-to-digital converters, keyboards, displays of different technologies (including latest graphics LCD modules), power and different communications interfaces and protocols. This modular architecture can be used in basic training modules (such as analog and digital electronics) but also in more specific modules such as sound, home automation, robotics and industrial control. The components used are cheap and modules can be built in the schools to reduce its cost. The schematics and printed circuit boards are free to use and for their design has been used the open source program Kicad. The microcontroller programming environment is based on Eclipse-SDCC, which is also open source and multiplatform. This system can be used for demonstrations and school practices. The system can also be used as a platform for teaching C programming or assembler for microcontrollers. All the elements have been developed at the institute ""Escolas Proval"" of Nigrán (Pontevedra) by a team of electronics teachers and students.

In learning theories, motivation can be observed as a key factor. In some cases learning can become playing if the learning experience is so intrinsically satisfying and rewarding that external pressures or rewards for learning are of secondary importance. Serious games are able to increase motivation for learning by realizing diverse approaches which can address cognitive as well as affective learning. By using a variety of elements such as visual environments, story-lines, challenges, and interactions with non-player characters, serious games can be optimal learning environments. Even though, they have such motivational power, several studies have shown that there are no known forms of education as effective as a professional human tutor. This paper explores the interaction of human tutors with learners in a serious games with the focus on `Social Development Theory'. It will present results that show how human tutors observe players in executing learning tasks, and interacting with the game environment in serious games.

This rich diversity of OSS projects, however, presents the greatest hurdle in seamlessly selecting suitable projects for integration. To better understand the scope of this diversity, initially, we propose to manually select uniformly difficult projects of appropriate complexity. Ultimately, based on the experiences and insights acquired through the manual selection, we envision the development of a systematic methodology based on software metrics to ease the project selection process.

In a constrained undergraduate environment mechanical engineering students at West Point are not allotted sufficient time in their curriculum to master text-based programming languages. In studying mechatronics, it is desirable for them to program robots to demonstrate useful behavior, and a method that simplifies the programming is necessary. Graphical programming in lieu of text-based programming was used at the Academy and was shown to reduce the time for the students to learn to program without limiting the functional capability of the programming language. The method uses Simulink with a third-party chip-specific Simulink blockset that allow programmers to automatically generate executable code for inputs, outputs, and internal functions of the microcontroller chip. PIC32 microcontrollers were used. It is shown that it is easier to convey the algorithm in the Simulink implementation than it is to convey the traditional C-language implementation of the same algorithm. It is quicker to develop algorithms using the Simulink-based method. It is found that these benefits outweigh the disadvantages associate with the higher level of programming abstraction. The method is relevant as a software development tool in that it allows an engineer to move quickly from theory to proof-of-concept and into prototyping. The method is scalable to military and industrial applications outside of academia although it is not yet widely used there.","2325-0526;23250526","Electronic:978-1-4673-0856-4; POD:978-1-4673-0855-7","10.1109/TePRA.2012.6215653","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6215653","algorithm;graphical programming;high-level language;microcontroller;programming;software development","Application software;Fires;Mechatronics;Microcontrollers;Programming profession","engineering education;graphical user interfaces;mechanical engineering;mechanical engineering computing;mechatronics;microcontrollers;robot programming;visual programming","C-language implementation;PIC32 microcontroller chip;West Point;graphical microcontroller programming technique;mechanical engineering students;mechatronics;programming abstraction;robot programming;robotic algorithms;software development tool;third-party chip-specific Simulink blockset","","1","","8","","","","23-24 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One reason for this bias seems to be that the effort estimates produced by software developers are affected by information that has no relevance for the actual use of effort. We attempted to acquire a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms and the robustness of this type of estimation bias. For this purpose, we hired 374 software developers working in outsourcing companies to participate in a set of three experiments. The experiments examined the connection between estimation bias and developer dimensions: self-construal (how one sees oneself), thinking style, nationality, experience, skill, education, sex, and organizational role. We found that estimation bias was present along most of the studied dimensions. The most interesting finding may be that the estimation bias increased significantly with higher levels of interdependence, i.e., with stronger emphasis on connectedness, social context, and relationships. We propose that this connection may be enabled by an activation of one's self-construal when engaging in effort estimation, and a connection between a more interdependent self-construal and increased search for indirect messages, lower ability to ignore irrelevant context, and a stronger emphasis on socially desirable responses.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2011.40","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6193066","Effort estimation;cultural differences;estimation bias;software engineering.","Companies;Context;Estimation;Instruments;Outsourcing;Programming;Software","estimation theory;software management","interdependence role;outsourcing companies;project failures;project plans;software development estimation","","4","","48","","","20120501","May-June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, assembling and delivering quality case studies to students requires a great deal of practical disciplinary knowledge, and a careful alignment of the case content and delivery style with curricular objectives, course learning outcomes, and the overarching institutional format. In this paper, we summarize our experience with an approach for constructing case study teaching materials that are integrative and deep in content, but also carefully aligned to the core principles and format of a senior-level software engineering course.

In fact, we observe that even advanced software developers abandon good design practices when developing software while using a framework, and focus on simply “making it work.” This paper presents and discusses a methodology developed for designing software in the context of frameworks to overcome these issues.

The analysis provided a wide spectrum of perspectives on leadership however there were strong themes that suggest there is a linkage between authority and leadership. There is a belief that the type and the degree of leadership required are different for professional practice versus academia. There are also strong themes that leadership is heavily influenced by natural traits (nature), but interestingly, by learnable skills and behaviors (nurture), and very much dependent on the actual environment (context).

Each generation of engineers has used that part of mechanics of materials theory that fit the calculating capability available to them. The method presented here is offered in that vein. The method uses an engineer's ability to construct free body diagrams, derive moment equations, and knowledge of energy methods. The problem solution is kept general until the last step which is a digital numerical integration. The digital numerical integration can be performed on a wide variety of software to include TKSolver™, MatLab<sup>®</sup>, MathCad<sup>®</sup>, EES<sup>®</sup> and spread sheets. This method keeps the section properties independent of the moment equations making it straightforward to include scaling and shape factors on the cross-sectional dimensions. This allows an engineer to run any number of ""what if"" scenarios during a design process. Additionally, this method provides intermediate opportunities to validate the solution path by a) plotting the moment equation and comparing it against shear and moment diagram developed by hand, or b) plotting the cross section and comparing it against the drawings.

The aim of the work presented here is to develop an accurate and cheap optical-system simulation software that provides a virtual laboratory for studying the effects of propagation in both time and space for the near- and far-field regions. In laboratory sessions, this software can let optical engineering undergraduates simulate many optical systems based on thin slits. The numerical method used is the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method that has been successfully applied in many engineering fields. Using this numerical method, the irradiance distribution can be successfully evaluated in different planes far from the simulation grid without degrading performance. In addition, an easy-to-use MATLAB GUI handles all the parameters of the FDTD simulation and computes theoretical values of irradiance for both the Fresnel and Fraunhofer regions. Therefore, by using this software, the student is able to analyze the behavior of the Fresnel and Fraunhofer expressions as a function of the distance. This distance is defined as the space between the slits plane and the plane that contains the virtual screen on which the irradiance pattern is represented.","0018-9359;00189359","","10.1109/TE.2011.2150750","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5773462","Diffraction;education;finite-difference method;optics;virtual laboratory","Apertures;Approximation methods;Diffraction;Finite difference methods;Optical diffraction;Software","computer aided instruction;finite difference time-domain analysis;graphical user interfaces;light diffraction;light interference;light propagation;mathematics computing;physics computing;physics education","FDTD method;Fraunhofer region;Fresnel region;MATLAB GUI;educational software;far field region;finite difference time domain method;irradiance distribution;light diffraction;light interference;light propagation effects;near field region;optical system simulation software;virtual laboratory;virtual screen","","9","","22","","","20110527","Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

An important tool that may aid in developing those skills is facilitation, a process that encourages information sharing and clear communication, which provides more opportunities for team members to better collaborate. A virtual facilitator was developed to aid in online communication. It provides prompts and interventions designed by using Chris Argyris's Model II communication techniques to guide the user to communicate in more open ways. This quasi-experimental study explores whether students exposed to virtual facilitator software are more likely to model communication techniques displayed by the virtual facilitator. Teams of students worked online on a time-sensitive project. The virtual facilitator intervened in the conversations of teams in a treatment group, while it remained idle in the Control group. Pre-tests and post-tests were administered to measure whether exposure to the virtual facilitator increased students' capacity to enact interventions. Based on Albert Bandura's observational learning theory, researchers expected that students exposed to the virtual facilitator would report the use of more facilitative behaviors.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-61284-469-5; POD:978-1-61284-468-8; USB:978-1-61284-467-1","10.1109/FIE.2011.6142859","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6142859","Communication;Engineering Professional Skills;Facilitation;Teamwork","Cities and towns;Communities;Conferences;Educational institutions;Lead;Software;Teamwork","computer aided instruction;engineering education;professional communication;team working;virtual reality","Albert Bandura observational learning theory;Chris Argyris Model II communication techniques;engineering students;information sharing;online communication;professional skills;session clear communication;team communication model;time-sensitive project;virtual facilitator software","","3","","17","","","","12-15 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, learning object-oriented concepts is crucial in undergraduate Computer Science or Information Technology programs. Learning object-oriented programming requires high concentration to understand the whole concepts before embarking on the practical aspect. It could be difficult for some students especially novices. In addition, lecturers might not be able to explain the subject effectively due to many factors. This research aims to justify and investigate more aspects to support the understanding of object-oriented concepts through games. Game is one of the approaches that could attract students' attention and increases their focus in learning object-oriented theory and practice. This paper reports a feasibility study using a controlled experiment that investigated the effect of using games in learning object-oriented programming among Computer Science students. The findings show that learners prefer using game as compared to traditional approach of teaching. Based on the study, we propose a more effective game-based approach to support the students in learning object-oriented concepts and programming.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1531-0; POD:978-1-4577-1530-3","10.1109/MySEC.2011.6140689","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6140689","Game-Based Approach;Goal Question Metric (GQM);Object-Oriented Concepts;Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)","Games;Java;Object oriented programming;Programming profession;Usability","computer aided instruction;computer games;computer science education;object-oriented programming;teaching","game-based approach;information technology program;learning;object-oriented concept;object-oriented practice;object-oriented programming;object-oriented theory;software development;student attention;teaching;undergraduate computer science student","","8","","18","","","","13-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once finish using the resources, the software systems must release these resources by explicitly calling specific resource-releasing API methods. Failing to release resources properly could result in resource leaks or even outright system failures. Existing verification techniques could analyze software systems to detect defects related to failing to release resources. However, these techniques require resource-releasing specifications for specifying which API method acquires/releases certain resources, and such specifications are not well documented in practice, due to the large amount of manual effort required to document them. To address this issue, we propose an iterative mining approach, called RRFinder, to automatically mining resource-releasing specifications for API libraries in the form of (resource-acquiring, resource-releasing) API method pairs. RRFinder first identifies resource-releasing API methods, for which RRFinder then identifies the corresponding resource-acquiring API methods. To identify resource-releasing API methods, RRFinder performs an iterative process including three steps: model-based prediction, call-graph-based propagation, and class-hierarchy-based propagation. From heterogeneous information (e.g., source code, natural language), the model-based prediction employs a classification model to predict the likelihood that an API method is a resource-releasing method. The call-graph-based and class-hierarchy-based propagation propagates the likelihood information across methods. We evaluated RRFinder on eight open source libraries, and the results show that RRFinder achieved an average recall of 94.0% with precision of 86.6% in mining resource-releasing specifications, and the mined specifications are useful in detecting resource leak defects.","1938-4300;19384300","Electronic:978-1-4577-1639-3; POD:978-1-4577-1638-6","10.1109/ASE.2011.6100058","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6100058","resource leak detection;resource-releasing specification;specification mining","Feature extraction;Iterative methods;Java;Libraries;Object oriented modeling;Predictive models;Resource management","application program interfaces;data mining;graph theory;iterative methods;pattern classification;program verification;public domain software","API libraries;RRFinder;call graph based propagation;class hierarchy based propagation;classification model;iterative mining;model based prediction;open source libraries;resource releasing API methods;resource releasing specifications;software systems;system failures;verification techniques","","3","1","22","","","","6-10 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A new image segmentation based on reconstruction labeling watershed algorithm in color space is proposed to solve these problems. First, the RGB color image is converted into a new color space image, and the gradients are calculated by extracting the directions which won't be affected by specularities and shadows. Second, object regions are extracted to compose a binary marked image through the use of morphological opening and closing reconstruction, and gradient image is introduced for substituting the marked image. Finally, the watershed transformation is carried out in the modified gradient image. The new algorithm not only can overcome over-segmentation produced by texture details and noises, but also suppress over-segmentation caused by specularities and shadows. Furthermore, the segmentation algorithm is used in the primitive gradient image instead of filtered and simplified images, so that the edge information of the object can be retained as much as possible. Theory analysis and experimental results have shown that our method has obtained obvious improvement.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0499-4; POD:978-1-4577-0500-7","10.1109/HAVE.2011.6088391","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088391","color space;image segmentation;labeling watershed;reconstruction;shadows;specularities","Algorithm design and analysis;Color;Educational institutions;Image color analysis;Image edge detection;Image reconstruction;Image segmentation","image colour analysis;image reconstruction;image segmentation;image texture","RGB color image;color space;image segmentation;morphological closing reconstruction;morphological opening reconstruction;morphological reconstruction;reconstruction labeling watershed algorithm;texture details","","1","","15","","","","14-17 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Students gain little practical experience in issues regarding software process in a typical software engineering course, although relevant theories are usually taught in lectures. The lack of practical experience is a bottleneck for effective learning of software engineering. It is almost impossible for students to understand the real concerns of practitioners without adequate practices. Consequently, they are not able to correctly apply the concepts or techniques, which is an important reason why they are regarded as being inexperienced. In addition, to develop increasingly sophisticated software, the IT industry keeps demanding better-prepared software engineering graduates.

However, manual unit testing is often tedious and insufficient. Testing tools can be used to enable economical use of resources by reducing manual effort. Recently parameterized unit testing has emerged as a very promising and effective methodology to allow the separation of two testing concerns or tasks: the specification of external, black-box behavior (i.e., assertions or specifications) by developers and the generation and selection of internal, white-box test inputs (i.e., high-code-covering test inputs) by tools. A parameterized unit test (PUT) is simply a test method that takes parameters, calls the code under test, and states assertions. PUTs have been supported by various testing frameworks. Various open source and industrial testing tools also exist to generate test inputs for PUTs. This tutorial presents latest research on principles and techniques, as well as practical considerations to apply parameterized unit testing on real-world programs, highlighting success stories, research and education achievements, and future research directions in developer testing. The tutorial will help improve developer skills and knowledge for writing PUTs and give overview of tool automation in supporting PUTs. Attendees will acquire the skills and knowledge needed to perform research or conduct practice in the field of developer testing and to integrate developer testing techniques in their own research, practice, and education.","0270-5257;02705257","Electronic:978-1-60558-719-6; POD:978-1-60558-719-6","10.1145/1810295.1810441","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062259","Pex;mock objects;parameterized unit testing;symbolic execution;testing;theories;unit testing","Education;Programming;Software;Testing;Tutorials;USA Councils;Writing","formal specification;program debugging;program testing;public domain software;software tools","black-box behavior specification;developer skills improvement;developer testing;education;external behavior specification;industrial testing tool;manual unit testing;open source testing tool;parameterized unit testing;software development life cycle;software reliability;testing tools;tool automation","","4","","12","","","","2-8 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The point of view in our report is the usability of Delphi in collecting qualitative data for software engineering research. The most significant features of the Delphi method are its recursion and the possibility to get immediate feedback and evaluate one's own answer. Although there are many forms of Delphi techniques, these features exist in one form or the other in all Delphi variations. In Delphi-based surveys, the minimum number of participants is smaller and participants are not selected at random but because of their particular expertise. Among the traditional research methods this is seen to cause the risk of bias and endangering both reliability and validity. In the Delphi method, the recursion produced by three or more rounds, the expertise and - in most cases - anonymity of participants, and the opportunity to evaluate and argue one's own answer after having seen the other opinions and arguments are thought to guarantee the quality of well-planned and well-conducted research.","2159-5100;21595100","Electronic:978-1-890843-23-6; POD:978-1-4577-1552-5; USB:978-1-890843-24-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6017716","","Business;Cultural differences;Education;Instruments;Reliability theory;Sampling methods","philosophical aspects;social aspects of automation;software reliability","Delphi method;Delphi techniques;Delphi-based surveys;philosophical aspect;reliability aspect;software engineering research;validity aspect","","1","","26","","","","July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The computation results show that the casing change whether thinner or thicker has an obvious effect on the time domain logging responses. The simulation results also indicate the higher the casing electrical conductivity, the lower the response signal amplitude; and the lower the magnetic permeability, the more easy the electromagnetic signals through the casing.

On May 10th in 2007, when Shui-Bu-Ya Reservoir water level rose to 289m, the front part of the slope was collapsed locally, so it is significant to study on the stability of Mu-Zhu-Ping slope. At first, three-dimensional geology generalization model was established according to the topographic and geologic conditions of Mu-Zhu-Ping slope. And then, based on coupled fluid-solid theory, the Fluid-Solid Coupling calculation was made on different water levels by the ABAQUS finite element software. According to the calculation, the results show that displacement in the front of slope was larger along with reservoir water level rise. When water level reached to 289m, the phenomenon of deformation and slumping was occurred locally in the front of slope. When water level is 360m, it was that deformation zone was formed in the front of slope while the stability at the central and upper part was better. When water level reached to 400 m, the instability would be happened in the front part of the slope locally because two larger deformation area was generated in the front of slope, and plastic path at the bottom of the slope was cutting thought thus the global stability of the slope was poor. The achieved results can provide a foundation for the further analysis of the stability of Mu-Zhu-Ping slope.","","Electronic:978-1-61284-774-0; POD:978-1-61284-771-9","10.1109/ICMT.2011.6003276","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6003276","ABAQUS;deformation analysis;fluid-solid coupling;rising of reservoir water level","Plastics;Reservoirs;Rocks;Stability analysis;Strain;Stress","deformation;finite element analysis;geotechnical engineering;mechanical stability;reservoirs;soil","3D geology generalization model;ABAQUS finite element software;China;Hubei province;Mo-Dao River;Mu-Zhu-Ping slope deformation;Mu-Zhu-Ping slope stability;Qing-Jiang Shui-Bu-Ya Reservoir region;Shui-Bu-Ya Reservoir water level;coupled fluid-solid theory;fluid-solid coupling calculation;geologic conditions;quaternary system;reservoir water level rise;slope displacement;slumping;topographic conditions","","0","","4","","","","26-28 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, it presents a framework of mechanisms blind students apply to identify basic 3D objects into free space. People with visual impairments are still excluded from accessing certain types of information - like graphics - that are easily accessible by the general public. Today, screen reading software and Braille displays or text-to-speech systems have solved many problems of accessing text. For accessing graphics, and specifically digital graphics, there is to date no standardised technology that is accepted and used by blind people. Especially in school education, access to pictures is almost impossible to master; making teamwork very complicated and thus isolating blind students from their sighted peers making it impossible to acquire a shared understanding of school material. Focusing on geometry, which is believed to be the main theory of space, is very crucial for non-sighted students to develop an accurate spatial sense and reasoning. The emergence of haptic technology and the potential to create interfaces for non-visual audio-haptic interaction opens new promising doors to accessing digital graphics.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1301-9; POD:978-1-4577-1300-2","10.1109/CEEC.2011.5995820","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995820","Haptic System;Human Computer Interaction;Novint Falcon;Virtual Learning Environments;Vision","Educational institutions;Face;Fingers;Games;Haptic interfaces;Three dimensional displays;Visualization","computer aided instruction;computer graphics;handicapped aids;haptic interfaces;shape recognition;speech synthesis","3D shapes learning;Braille displays;audio haptic learning environment;blind students;digital graphics;haptic sense technology;haptic technology;school education;school material;text-to-speech systems;visual impairments","","4","","16","","","","13-14 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They are supposed to have defined learning outcomes and are claimed to have positive impacts on the players' development of new knowledge or different skills. To design good serious games we need to be able to design and produce good software. But they are more than software. We also need to be able to design and produce good instruction. The potential value of serious computer games for learning seems high, but there remains resistance to the use of games in the classroom. A reasonable way to convince more teachers to try games is through pedagogy, connecting elements of existing games designs with accepted learning and instructional theories. At the Faculty of Education of the University of Ljubljana we have been developing serious game TimeMesh in the framework of the Comenius programme.

However, student learning of basic and advanced electromagnetic and antenna are difficult because the fundamental quantities are based on abstract mathematics describing fields and waves which are hard to visualize. The existing system of conventional undergraduate teaching provides little practical experiences through laboratory exercises and direct visualization of electromagnetic fields is not possible. Thus, students have difficulty visualizing the related phenomena in electromagnetic and antenna. Consequently, their understanding and ability to be creative in problem solving in these technical areas will be affected. The use of computer technology for visualization of electromagnetic and antenna phenomena is one of the best vehicles to overcome these difficulties. Hence, a visualization and learning aid software package is recently developed by the authors for educational as well as research purposes.

This course basically teaches the students on how to design microprocessor-based systems. The students have to understand in detail about the architecture of the microprocessor and learn how to write comprehensive assembly language programs. Teaching and learning the theory of programming is a challenging task since it involves the abstract notions and logical thinking. In addition, they have to have the detailed knowledge on the hardware aspect of the processor. Unfortunately, most of these students adopt a surface approach and tend to accept information passively. They also tend to concentrate only on what will be asked in the examinations and prefer to memorize facts rather than reflecting on the purpose and analyzing the information. They need to adopt a deep approach to learning and interact with the content critically in order to integrate both the hardware and software aspects in their design. This paper discusses the integrated, practical, and student-centered approach for teaching this important subject in the Department of Electrical, Electronics and System Engineering, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM).

On the one hand, studies on psychological assessment, human resources management and development have extensively discussed the definition and classification of competence; on the other hand, practical research on the competences of different occupations has attracted considerable attention. Previous studies have presented numerous analytical procedures and research methods. Further elaborating these methods can derive higher quality competency models based on different perspectives. This investigation incorporated the notion of adaptive theory into the Job Competence Analysis (JCA) method. Through rigid qualitative data analysis, this study integrated the existing literature with in-depth interviews conducted with managers and experts. This yielded a practical competence model that indentified the core competences of an occupation or industry. Taking IT professionals as an example, this study carried out field research that followed the practical model and clarified the core competencies of IT professionals in the business service sector in Taiwan. Theoretically, this model can not only establish a foundation for further research on core competence, but can also guide decision making on human resource management and development. Practically, by identifying core competences in the business services this investigation significantly helps the development of practical training programs.","1093-0175;10930175","Electronic:978-1-4577-0348-5; POD:978-1-4577-0349-2","10.1109/CSEET.2011.5876158","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5876158","","Biological system modeling;Companies;Data models;Humans;Industries;Interviews","competitive intelligence;data analysis;decision making;industrial psychology;industrial training;job specification;professional aspects","IT professional competence analysis;JCA method;adaptive theory;business service sector;decision making;human resource management;interviews;job competence analysis method;practical training programs;psychological assessment;qualitative data analysis","","0","","22","","","","22-24 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The theory of negative imaginary systems arose out of a desire to unify a number of classical methods for the control of lightly damped structures with collocated force actuators and position sensors including positive position feedback and integral force feedback. The key result is a stability result which shows why these methods are guaranteed to yield robust closed loop stability in the face of unmodelled spillover dynamics. Related results to be presented connect the theory of negative imaginary systems to positive real systems theory and a negative imaginary lemma has been established which is analogous to the positive real lemma.

As the lack of resources is a problem that can be solved through AR, this paper represents and explains the usage of AR technology in what can be named Augmented Reality Student Card (ARSC) for serving the education field. ARSC uses single static markers combined in one card for assigning different objects, leaving the choice to the computer application for minimizing the tracking process. ARSC is designed to be a useful low cost solution for serving the education field. ARSC represents any lesson in a 3D format that helps students to visualize the facts, interact with theories and deal with the information in a totally new effective and interactive way. ARSC can be used in offline, online and game applications with seven markers, four of them are used as a joystick game controller. One of the novelties in this paper is that full experimental tests had been made for the ARTag marker set for sorting them according to their efficiency. The results of the tests are used in this research to choose the most efficient markers for ARSC, and can be used for further researches. The experimental work that had been made in this paper also shows the constraints for marker creation for an AR application. Due to the need to work for online and offline application, merging of toolkits and libraries has been made, as presented in this paper. ARSC was examined by a number of students of both genders with average age between 10-17 years and it was found to have a great acceptance among them.","","Electronic:978-1-61284-185-4; POD:978-1-61284-184-7","10.1109/ICENCO.2010.5720437","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5720437","Augmented Reality;Computer Assisted Learning;Mixed Reality;Optical tracking","Cameras;Education;Lead;Navigation;Optical imaging;Productivity;Software","augmented reality;computer aided instruction;interactive devices;natural scenes","AR technology;ARSC;augmented reality student card;joystick game controller;real scenes;tracking process;virtual objects","","1","","18","","","","27-28 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Shafts are subjected to both combined and variable loading, resulting in fatigue-mode stress and deflection; to further complicate the calculations, many shafts are of a stepped or tapered cross-sectional area. A thorough review of the textbooks available and the wider body of mechanical engineering literature revealed a paucity of strategies for either teaching or conducting the analysis required for proper design. In this paper we describe a structured problem-solving approach which uses the students' understanding of free-body-diagrams, shear and moment equations, and energy methods.

Lectures are supported by tutorials of approximately 32 students which incorporate collaborative team learning activities and project-based learning. Each tutor is responsible for grading the assessment tasks for students in their tutorial. A common issue is how to achieve a consistent standard of marking between different tutors. To address this issue the authors have used a number of methods including double-blind marking and remarking to support consistent grading. Despite mainly finding only small variations between the grading of different tutors a number of students still complained about a perceived lack of consistency. We theorised that differences in the feedback provided by tutors was a contributing factor to this perception. In this paper we report investigating this theory and finding that while students' perception of difference in grading were not unfounded, the problem was exacerbated by inconsistencies in the language tutors use when providing feedback.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4244-6262-9; POD:978-1-4244-6261-2","10.1109/FIE.2010.5673351","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5673351","SPARKPLUS;academic standards;marker moderation;self and peer assessment","Benchmark testing;Conferences;Education;Software tools;Solids;Standards;Tutorials","educational administrative data processing;engineering computing;engineering education;groupware","assessment tasks grading;collaborative team learning activity;double-blind marking;engineering design subject;project-based learning;tutor grading","","1","","17","","","","27-30 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Examples include hardware principles, architecture and theory, along with software development tools and processes. Recent studies have suggested that a focus on the computational infrastructure in the absence of an external application domain may reinforce the stereotype of CS student fixation on the computer for some, while alienating a subset of students, especially women, who may be attracted to using the computer to solve broader problems. Recognizing this situation has inspired recent explorations on teaching computer science within an application context. Even classes traditionally focused on techniques and problems beyond the computer itself, such as Computer Graphics and Artificial Intelligence (AI), are often presented as a collection of techniques, programs, and principles without systematic ""real-world"" grounding. Inspired by work on teaching Computer Graphics in context, this work-in-progress describes an infrastructure for embedding a biomedical motif into the traditional Artificial Intelligence course.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4244-6262-9; POD:978-1-4244-6261-2","10.1109/FIE.2010.5673167","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5673167","Artificial Intelligence;Contextual instruction;Instructional approaches;Pedagogy","Artificial intelligence;Biomedical imaging;Computer graphics;Computer science;Computers;Context;Education","artificial intelligence;computer graphics;computer science education;software engineering","artificial intelligence teaching;biomedical motif;computer graphics;computer science program;software development tools","","0","","14","","","","27-30 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Her experience has been that concepts are difficult to convey, particularly if the students do not have prior industrial experience. Additionally, standards are topics which can become very boring to teach and learn. These difficulties have resulted in an uninteresting learning environment where it is hard to gauge what learning, if any, has been undertaken by the students. Therefore, in conjunction with the second author (YD), a problem-based learning practitioner and researcher, we investigated what other teaching methodologies could be used to improve the situation. This has resulted in IR implementing a problem-based learning instructional approach in the classroom during academic year 2009-2010. Through focusing on software systems within hospitals, students within a software quality class have developed a software quality plan supported by an academic paper. Analysing the implementation of PBL in the class, we demonstrate that students have developed a greater understanding of software quality concepts and standards. consistent with the findings of Hmelo-Silver, it has also resulted in students experiencing and learning competencies such as team working, presentation and discussion, which are required in an industrial environment.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4241-6; POD:978-1-4244-8539-0","10.1109/QUATIC.2010.27","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5655260","PBL;competencies;problem-based learning;software quality;software quality plan","Education;Employment;Hospitals;Software engineering;Software quality;Tutorials","computer science education;teaching","industrial environment;learning environment;problem-based learning instructional approach;problem-based learning practitioner;software quality class;software quality plan;teaching methodologies","","0","","22","","","","Sept. 29 2010-Oct. 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Three improved interacting multiple model (IMM) algorithms for manoeuvring target tracking are presented, in which the filter outputs are combined based on three optimal multi-model fusion criterions weighted by scalars, diagonal matrices and general matrices, respectively. The proposed algorithms can receive the optimal state estimations of target in the linear minimum variance sense. It is proved that the traces of variance matrices of tracking errors in three proposed algorithms are less than the trace in the classical IMM algorithm. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations verify that the proposed algorithms are effective and have an absolute advantage in the velocity estimation. In particular, one of the proposed algorithms is obviously better than the IMM algorithm in accuracy and elapsed time and, therefore, can be a competitive alternative to the classical IMM algorithm for the tracking of manoeuvring target in real time.","1751-8644;17518644","","10.1049/iet-cta.2009.0583","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5611738","","","Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;discrete time systems;parameter estimation;state estimation;stochastic systems;target tracking","Markov switching parameters;Monte Carlo simulations;diagonal matrices;discrete-time stochastic systems;interacting multiple model;linear minimum variance sense;manoeuvring target;optimal multimodel fusion;state estimation;tracking errors;variance matrices;velocity estimation","","6","","","","","","October 2010","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

The concept, which is called separation of concerns during the development of aspect-oriented software, can well support the dynamic evolution of software. Motivated by this, we propose a new model, called Aspect-Oriented Dynamic Software Architecture (AODSA), to support software dynamic evolution. The existing formal methods can not describe evolution process intuitively. Bigraph is a formal description language based on graphic which owns accurate and visual representation styles. We extend the existing Bigraph theory to represent AODSA. In order to signify the dynamic evolution of AODSA effectively, Bigraphical Reactive System (BRS) is applied to represent the evolution operation of AODSA. Meanwhile, the term language of Bigraph can describe the evolution operation of AODSA accurately which will lay the foundations for the further formal verification. Finally, a simple example is given to illustrate the usage of AODSA.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6005-2; POD:978-1-4244-6002-1","10.1109/ICCSE.2010.5593683","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5593683","AODSA;bigraph;bigraph reactive system;dynamic evolution","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Connectors;Software;Software architecture;Unified modeling language;Weaving","aspect-oriented programming;computer software;formal verification;graph theory;software architecture;software maintenance","Internet;aspect-oriented dynamic software architecture;bigraph theory;bigraphical reactive system;computer software;formal description language;formal methods;formal verification;software dynamic evolution;software engineering;visual representation styles","","1","","11","","","","24-27 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is well known that the optical output power is degraded with the heat integration. Hence, thermal management and evaluation system is required. Thermal conductivity is regarded as one of the most important properties that directly influence the thermal performance for thermal interface materials (TIMs). Different methods have been used to measure the thermal conductivity of TIM. Some testers with satisfied accuracy have also been discussed in papers. However, they are generally of high cost and complex structure design. In this paper, a novel thermal conductivity tester for optoelectronic materials with low cost was designed and built based on one-dimension heat transfer theory and the processing technology. Details of the measurement methodology and the apparatus development were introduced. The tester was designed based on ASTM D5470 which is specified to the thermal conductivity measurement of TIM. According to modular design principle, the apparatus can be divided into five parts, including frame, loading, heating and cooling units and in-situ thickness measurement. In determination of the external loads on the test samples, a force transducer was located in the loading module, which would improve the accuracy and repeatability during the tests. A circulating water cooling system and a flexible heating source were utilized to provide temperature gradient. Moreover, an in situ thickness meter was used for the specimen thickness measurement and monitoring, consequently, the error in thickness estimation could be minimized. On the other hand, by using finite element method, the structures of heating and cooling modules were optimized to achieve uniform temperature distribution and the simulated results matched well with the experiment. Thermistors were used for experimental comparison and characterization. A data acquisition system was developed via Labview software fo- - r data fitting and result analysis.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8142-2; POD:978-1-4244-8140-8","10.1109/ICEPT.2010.5582397","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5582397","ASTM D5470;LED;steady state;thermal conductivity;thermal conductivity tester;thermal interface materials","Bars;Conductivity;Heating;Materials;Temperature measurement;Thermal conductivity;Thermal resistance","finite element analysis;light emitting diodes;thermal conductivity;thermal management (packaging);thermistors","1D heat transfer theory;ASTM D5470;Labview software;circulating water cooling system;data acquisition system;finite element method;force transducer;heat integration;in-situ thickness measurement;light emitting diode;optical output power;optoelectronic device;temperature gradient;thermal conductivity meter;thermal interface materials;thermal management;thermistors;thickness estimation","","0","","8","","","","16-19 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We call it the integrated approach. It is based on the idea that students study the theory part in the lab and immediately execute a series of laboratory exercises implementing what they have studied in theory.

WF-SME, a visual integrated modeling environment is mainly used for the rapid realization of model dynamic integration, in which we can implement the composition and connection of the existing models, and generate new model through graphical operation. The papers firstly introduce the framework of model integration designed for WF-SME as well as its supporting theory, and then explain in detail how the modules of WF-SME have been realized. WF-SME is a platform for spatial modelling, which was designed in four parts, Spatial Workflow Designer, Model builder, Spatial Calculation engine and Visualization of Modelling Output. The spatial workflow designer built-in WF-SME shipping with toolsets was adopted to create spatial workflow, reuse and aggregate models. Consisting of equation editor and data banding tool, the model builder enable modeller updates formulas on-demand. This editor parsed by MathML is powerful and flexible enough for the requirements of expressions of mathematical calculations. The spatial calculating engine developed based on component, through the map algebra language, executes mathematical calculations. The multi-form visualization module was developed to provide visual expression for a series of intermediate data and its result of the domain models. Finally, we illustrate how the typical practical application sample has been modeled in our modeling environment to validate the feasibility and efficiency of WF-SME. As a case study, grassland ecosystem productivity mechanism model whose input parameters include PAR (Photo synthetically active radiation), Temperature, Precipitation, Soil fertility etc, were build using WF-SME.

It is an important thing to understand the effects of process parameters on temperature distribution. This study develops an analytical and numerical model for cutting temperature prediction of AISI4340 stainless steel. The simulation model was set up in commercial FEM software of Abaqus6.8, which was good at nonlinear dynamic calculation. An ALE finite element model was used, which combines the advantages of both Lagrangian and Eulerian techniques. The Johnson-Cook plasticity model was used to model the workpiece material. This model is suitable for modeling cases with high strain, strain rates, strain hardening, and non-linear material properties. A failure criterion for chip formation was used, which ensured that the chip was twisted far away from workpiece surface. An analytical model was used to understand the temperature distribution in the primary heat source and third heat source. To satisfy the adiabatic condition of thermal mechanical theory at the workpiece boundary which contained the chip up surface and tool-worpiece surface, two imaginary heat sources were used. The temperature rise in machined workpiece is the combination of the primary and third heat sources, which the primary heat source is modeled as a uniform moving oblique band heat source and the third heat source as a non-uniform moving rectangular heat source within a semi-infinite medium. The analytical modeling and FEM modeling results match very well.","","DVD:978-1-4244-7738-8; Electronic:978-1-4244-7739-5; POD:978-1-4244-7737-1","10.1109/MACE.2010.5535862","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5535862","FEM modeling;analytical modeling;cutting temperature distribution;stainless steel","Analytical models;Building materials;Capacitive sensors;Finite element methods;Lagrangian functions;Machining;Material properties;Numerical models;Steel;Temperature distribution","","","","0","","7","","","","26-28 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many learning activities can use social media to facilitate the processes, such as collaborative writing, brainstorming, and live presentation streaming. Some instructors have paid attention to the popularity of social media. Social media is very simple and intuitive for users with information literacy on desktop computer. Also, social media is very popular on mobile devices, such as PDA and smartphone. Although learners can receive information for collaborative learning from social media on mobile devices, they generally tend to response simple text on mobile devices and complex interactions on desktop computer. This paper suggests another inexpensive way to enable complex interactions on mobile devices by integrating social media with a digital camera bar scanner. Consequently, a learner can annotate a video clip on a mobile device by cards with QR code. After everyone finishes recording, all clips with annotations can be uploaded into a social media system for sharing. Thus, an augmented tagging system is constructed for learners to response complex messages on mobile devices.

ISD is viewed as an organizational change project that aims at improving an organization through the adoption of IT applications. The course is designed following a project led approach. The project involves describing an organization as a system, describing its information handling activities and proposing a set of IT applications that could be adopted and used. Students are guided by a ISD methodology that demands the application of previous developed competencies in areas such as: organization theory, accounting, marketing, information systems fundamentals, data bases, software engineering, computer networks and several other IT courses. Together with the ISD course, students are also taking courses on organizational behavior and data-warehousing. Students are organized into large teams of 10 to 12 members. Several roles are distributed among team members: e.g., team leader, analyst, document officer, technology officer, methodologist, development tools specialist, IT specialist. Students are suggested a fictional organization in a specific business area. Ideally students should deal with a real organization. As the course is having around 100 students enrolled this is not possible. However it is common that each project team finds an organization in the proposed business area where they go and have actual contact with an organization. The main outputs of the project include: project plan; organization description including - purpose, environment, main activities, business ontology, main performance indicators; general information systems description using UML; requirements for an IT application; IT architecture. One of the most important steps of the project is to decide on what IT to suggest to the organization. The decision should take into consideration the capability of current IT,- - the specifics of the business area and its current practices. Besides the reports, each team makes two public presentations. The first one is to present the organization description making sure business is clearly understood. The final one is to present the solution in terms of information systems and IT architecture. These presentations are attended by industry guests that focus their attention on the students' communication skills from the perspective of a manager. The evaluation of students' performance is based on: reports corresponding to the outputs mentioned above; public presentations; weekly assessments of the teams' progress. The final mark attributed to each team (a numerical value from 0 to 20, where above 10 is a pass) can be re-distributed among team members, by themselves, in order to account for different levels of commitment or effort within the team. Several other rules are set in order to promote professional behavior.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6042-7; POD:978-1-4244-6040-3","10.1109/TEE.2010.5508847","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5508847","","Application software;Communication industry;Computer networks;Computer science education;Information systems;Management information systems;Ontologies;Software engineering;Text analysis;Unified modeling language","educational courses;information science education","IT organization;information handling activities;information systems development course;information technology course;professional behavior promotion;students performance evaluation","","0","","9","","","","6-9 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These applications have allowed users to perform computations and calculations at levels of sophistication and depth that were not available to practitioners even one generation ago. They have also given educators the ability to convey advanced mathematical and engineering concepts in new ways and spend more time on analysis of engineering systems and less time on remedial mathematics. This new capability, which has become a fundamental tool for sophisticated designers in industry, is still not fully embraced in many engineering curricula. To exemplify the potential of scientific software in the engineering classroom, we describe a laboratory exercise conducted by second-year engineering students at Drexel University. It introduces a geosynchronous satellite orbital entry problem, and demonstrates how scientific software can help students understand the behavior of an interesting physical system in a way that would have required much more effort using traditional methods. We believe that early introduction to symbolic computation tools and scientific software would be very valuable to engineering students. Such tools should become standard instruments in the arsenal of present-day engineers. Moreover, their use should be adopted across the curriculum (not only in introductory mathematics classes) and become part of the design experience in all engineering disciplines.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6042-7; POD:978-1-4244-6040-3","10.1109/TEE.2010.5508844","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5508844","","Application software;Design engineering;Engineering students;Laboratories;MATLAB;Mathematics;Power engineering and energy;Power engineering computing;Satellites;Systems engineering and theory","computer aided instruction;computer science education;symbol manipulation","MATLAB;Maple;Mathematica;engineering concepts;engineering students;geosynchronous satellite orbital entry problem;mathematical concepts;scientific software skills;symbolic computation tools","","1","","18","","","","6-9 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has led to the development of an educational computer game, entitled Shortfall, which simulates a business milieu for testing alternative paths regarding the principles of sustainability. This paper examines social sustainability in the context of industry and through the lens of a capital-based theory of sustainability. Using a capital-based theory, the analysis of social sustainability is narrowed to the concept of social capital.

In the second group, an introduction to the courses that they will take in the next semesters of the program which includes programming, networking, software engineering, artificial intelligence and database systems. The main objective of this course is to give an introduction about the general concepts of the field to the first year Computer Engineering students and prepare them to understand the connections between them for their future studies. However, students and instructors face with many problems in this course. First, because of the diversity of the concepts given in the course, it is very difficult for the students to see the big picture of the Computer Engineering domain. Similarly, it is difficult for the instructors to prepare the course content in an integrated manner at the students' level. Additionally, the perception of the theory and practice behind the hardware and software topics and their connections is not an easy task for the beginners. Moreover, the topics are mostly abstract topics, which do not allow application of any laboratory sessions. Students usually find this course difficult to understand, which decreases their motivation about the department and success of the course. This study is established to propose a concept map approach to better visualize and discover all the connections between the concepts of Computer Engineering field which can be used in the curriculum of the programs and introductory courses of the field addressing the above problems.

It is by experiment that most scientists learn most about their discipline and in this paper the following ideas can be explored in simulations that in most cases use access to a database so that the exercises are personalised. The simulations are listed below. · Simple Entity-Relationship diagrams: Where simple Entity-Relationship diagrams can be composed from a set of components and their validity checked. · Entity-Relationships and tables that describe the entities: Where the student has to decide from tables of two entities the degree of participation and the participation conditions. With prompting the correct solution can be found and as many attempts as necessary are possible. · Structured Query Language (SQL): Given a database various SQL queries can input and the way that the queries are dealt with are shown in detail not just the final result. · Functional dependency: Given a table from a database this can used to find out whether there is any functional dependency between any of the columns and also to show what the primary key/s might be. · Normalisation: A topic that confuses may students. This allows table to be split into a number of sub-tables and the result can be tested as to whether the selected table can be joined together to form the original table.

As we are well aware, the need to use a practice and application oriented approach in education is paramount [1]. Research on active learning and cooperative groups showed that students grasps and have more tendency towards obtaining and realizing soft skills like leadership, communication and team work as opposed to learning using the traditional theory and exam based method. While this teaching and learning paradigm is relatively new in Malaysia, it has been practiced widely in the West. This paper examines a particular approach whereby students learning wireless security are divided into small manageable groups consisting of black hat and white hat team. The former will try to find and expose vulnerabilities in a wireless network while the latter will try to prevent such attacks on their wireless networks using hardware, software, design and enforcement of security policy and etc. This paper will try to demonstrate whether this approach will result in a more fruitful outcome in terms of students concept and theory understandings and motivation to learn.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-4844-9; POD:978-1-4244-4843-2","10.1109/ICEED.2009.5490612","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5490612","NS-2;education;networks;security;wireless;wireless networks simulation","Communication system security;Communications technology;Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Engineering education;Hardware;Information security;Software design;Wireless networks","","","","0","","16","","","","7-8 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But it suffers from high computational cost, limiting its usage in large-scale datasets. Moreover, Links between nodes are changing over time. It may be desirable to quickly approximate the similarity score between certain nodepair without performing a large-scale computation on the entire graph. In our approach we propose a method to efficiently estimate the similarity score using only a small subgraph of the entire graph. We call this novel algorithm “Local-SimRank”. The experimental results conducted on real datasets and synthetic dataset show that our algorithm efficiently produces good approximations to the global SimRank scores. Meanwhile, we prove that the Local-SimRank score LS(a, b) is always less than original SimRank score S(a, b) mathematically.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6600-9; POD:978-1-4244-6599-6","10.1109/APWeb.2010.47","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474140","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Computer science;Computer science education;Conference management;Data engineering;Knowledge engineering;Knowledge management;Large-scale systems;Web pages","graph theory;search engines","SimRank score estimation;graph;link analysis;local-SimRank;similarity measurement;similarity score estimation","","2","","22","","","","6-8 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sufficient stability conditions are provided in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which can determine learning gains as well.

Emergency response plans must be well-coordinated, crafted in accord with international standards, and give full consideration to all interrelated systems, stakeholders, and participants. Multiple agencies and parties contribute to the overall plan. The nuclear reactor facility in Angra dos Reis, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil conducts an exercise to test their emergency plans every two years. This paper presents a benchmarking and assessment of radiological emergency response plans at Angra dos Reis to identify potential needs for improvement. The method of analysis uses comparison with international standards, and a comparison with US plans. The paper develops recommendations to improve the existing Brazilian plan. The benchmarking and assessment make use of current radiological emergency response plans from US regions, interviews with local and regional, US and Brazilian emergency response coordinators, and video of the training exercises in emergency alert response simulation in Angra dos Reis. Features of emergency management software including WebEOC are considered and addressed in the recommendations. Social, demographic, and cultural factors are addressed.

As Europe's largest Software Company producing business software, SAP has specific requirements for the skill set of software architects. Since the tasks of software architects vary to a large degree, defining the core skills of software architects was a prerequisite for education. Furthermore, the education of future architects by external parties was also not an option since the majority of the content has to be adapted to the company's needs. Starting 2008, SAP has set up an Architecture Curriculum for the on-the-job education of future Software Architects. The curriculum reflects the typical tasks of Architects in a large software company, which deal with communicating architecture topics among various stakeholders, and with the definition of architecture - ensuring conceptual integrity and considering the big number of quality (aka non-functional) requirements. SAP already runs (or will run in the near future) this curriculum in all major development locations. The success and the positive feedback of the participants show that the concept of an on-the-job education works and that it can be applied to other software companies as well.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6538-5; POD:978-1-4244-6537-8","10.1109/ECBS.2010.28","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5457772","Curriculum;Education;Software Architect","Collaborative software;Companies;Computer architecture;Computer industry;Conferences;Europe;Feedback;Programming;Software quality;Systems engineering and theory","DP industry;computer science education;software architecture","SAP architecture curriculum;on-the-job education;software architects;software company","","0","","13","","","","22-26 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The MOSFET fabrication process used blanket-field oxide for isolation, positive resist for lithography process, boron and phosphorus for source/drain doping and aluminum for metallization. An economical solution of masks using transparency films with various channel lengths from 300 Â¿m to 500 Â¿m has been produced to reduce cost. Six layer photolithography masks of MOSFET were designed using AutoCAD drawing tools and then printed using high resolution laser printer on the transparency film. Contact printing method has been utilized to transfer the mask layouts onto a 4-inch silicon wafer using standard photolithography techniques to check the line uniformity. Optical observation using high power microscope shows that the mask layouts were successfully transferred onto photoresist with minimum variation. The n-well CMOS transistors were tested using Keithley 2400 source meter with Lab-view measurement software.

The primary cause of this difficulty is an inability to find a hardware solution that is powerful enough to run complex cutting-edge algorithms yet inexpensive enough to be purchased by an undergraduate class budget. An ideal system needs to have a gentle learning curve to allow students with minimal background in the field to get a robot up and running. Lastly, a fleet of classroom robots needs to be easy to administrate and maintain given the limited time of a Teaching Assistant. Our approach is to implement a centralized server system. In this system individual robots are inexpensive yet capable of establishing a WiFi link to a main server so that all the compilation and system administration, as well as much of the computationally intensive processing, are done on that server. We find that this solution saves both time and money and provides an effective teaching tool.

Inherently mathematical in nature, communications theory is a completely abstract concept for students. This is particularly true now since most of our students lack practical, hands-on experience with communications systems. Classroom demonstrations illustrating the theoretical concepts as they are introduced can be vital in motivating students and helping their understanding. This paper describes a set of innovative classroom demonstrations developed with software defined radio to illustrate the complex concepts presented in a communications course. Software defined radio offers a multitude of unique and effective tools to teach signals and communications. In simplest terms, SDR is the direct implementation of the mathematics of signal processing on real world signals. Instructors can go directly from theoretical equations to a program applying the theory to sampled data from a live or recorded real signal in software defined radio. With their own laptop computers, students can experiment with communications concepts, benefitting from the immediate and tangible experience in applying the complex theories and principles they are trying to master.","0190-5848;01905848","POD:978-1-4244-4715-2","10.1109/FIE.2009.5350716","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5350716","Classroom demonstration;Communications education;Signal processing;Software defined radio","Communication systems;Digital filters;Digital modulation;Digital signal processing;Electrical engineering;Equations;Mathematics;Portable computers;Signal processing;Software radio","signal processing;software radio;telecommunication engineering education","analog and/or digital modulation techniques;classroom demonstrations;communications course;communications theory;electrical engineering programs;laptop computers;signal processing course;signal processing systems;software defined radio","","17","","24","","","","18-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on in-depth analysis of Ramsey graph and bio-manipulation, our method can eliminate infeasible solutions in advance, and decrease enumeration greatly.

The performance of CS-based MDC (CS-MDC) depends on the efficacy of the CS recovery algorithm. Existing CS recovery algorithms recover the signal in a fixed space (e.g., Wavelet, DCT, and gradient spaces) for the entire duration of the signal, even though a typical multimedia signal exhibits sparsity in time/space variant spaces. To rectify this problem and develop a better CS recovery algorithm for CSMDC, we propose a learning-based framework to conduct the CS recovery in locally adaptive spaces, and carry out a case study on image MDC. A set of prior image models are learned offline from a training set to facilitate the CS recovery in local adaptive bases. Experiments show that the learning-based CS recovery algorithm can significantly improve the performance of the previous CS-MDC technique in both PSNR and visual quality.","","POD:978-1-4244-4463-2","10.1109/MMSP.2009.5293283","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5293283","","Application software;Computer science education;Decoding;IP networks;Image coding;Image reconstruction;Power system modeling;Rate-distortion;Signal processing;Streaming media","data compression;image coding","PSNR;compressive sensing;learning-based recovery;line granularity;local adaptive bases;multimedia signal;multiple description coding;visual quality","","2","","13","","","","5-7 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the complexity and indetermination of complex systems, it is difficult to study the complex systems with the traditional reductive theory. The agent-based computer simulation is approved in the paper. Because classical interactions only among pre-set behavioral models may limit the capability to explore all possible evolution patterns, to tackle this issue, we introduce participating method to the MAS model, propose participator MAS (P-MAS) modeling method. In order to support this new approach, we introduce the concept and framework of artificial classroom (AC) for the first time by employing artificial societies. By adopting the bottom-up modeling technique and MAS model, the innovative dynamic model of AC is built. We have given a system structure of AC, design and implement an AC based on TCP/IP. The AC is currently being developed in NetLogo/HubNet. It provides a good tool to study classroom behaviors.","","POD:978-0-7695-3745-0","10.1109/HIS.2009.121","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5254418","Hubnet;Netlogo;artificial classroom;multi-agent system;participator modeling method;teaching model","Adaptive systems;Artificial intelligence;Civil engineering;Computer architecture;Education;Educational institutions;Environmental economics;Humans;Hybrid intelligent systems;TCPIP","intelligent tutoring systems;multi-agent systems;teaching","Netlogo-based dynamic model;agent-based computer simulation;artificial classroom;complex adaptive system theory;multiagent system;participator MAS participator MAS;reductive theory;teaching behavior","","0","","11","","","","12-14 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But such materials have been applied extensively under AC electric field, and insulating materials damaged mostly under impulse voltage. The research on the AC response characteristic presents the foundations for the development and application of non-linear insulation dielectrics. In this paper, the coaxial electrodes structure filled with non-linear conductivity dielectrics is taken as main research object, and the finite element method (FEM) software ElecNet is adopted to simulate transient electric field distribution in the non-linear conductivity dielectrics under AC voltage. The result indicates that under AC, according to the theory of space charge limited field, the capability of the non-linear dielectrics in grading field is determined by the dominator of resistive current and capacitive current. When resistive current is larger than capacitive current, the non-linear conductivity dielectrics have the function of grading the electric field, vice versa.","2160-9225;21609225","POD:978-1-4244-4367-3","10.1109/ICPADM.2009.5252316","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5252316","ElecNet;non-linear;simulation;transient response","Application software;Coaxial components;Conducting materials;Conductivity;Dielectric materials;Dielectrics and electrical insulation;Electric fields;Electrodes;Transient response;Voltage","dielectric materials;electric fields;electrical conductivity;electrical engineering computing;finite element analysis;insulation;space charge;transient response","ElecNet;FEM software;capacitive current;coaxial electrodes;electric field;finite element method software;impulse voltage;nonlinear conductivity dielectrics;nonlinear insulating dielectrics;resistive current;space charge limited field;transient response","","1","","5","","","","19-23 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many good web sites programmed from various educational institutions are now available for their students to download lecture notes, study Web-based material and attend Web-lectures. Some of them even have Web-based video lectures or seminars. However, there still exist problems of this way of teaching especially for engineering courses because the laboratory class is fundamental to understand theoretical notes, and has difficulty to be conducted through the internet. In the past, student cannot get any experiment via internet because most of them are only computer simulation rather than real experiment. This is understandable because the Web-based hardware implementation is difficult especially in electrical engineering where high frequency, high power operation, and a lot of parameters are to be controlled and recorded and thus are difficult to be connected and controlled by the remote access. However today, with the rapid development of internet tools, electronics, and software this situation can be sorted out . It is primordial and interesting to let students have real practice and doing real experiment at anytime and everywhere with the condition that the internet connection is available.

The practice teaching result shows that the model greatly improves rationality for teaching of software project practice and it is accepted by students and teacher.","","POD:978-1-4244-3520-3","10.1109/ICCSE.2009.5228570","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5228570","Fuzzy Clustering;Genetic Algorithm;Project Practice;Teach Grouping","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Computer science;Computer science education;Educational institutions;Finance;Genetic algorithms;Simulated annealing;Software engineering;Software quality","computer science education;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;pattern clustering;project management;software engineering;teaching","fuzzy-based clustering genetic group model;genetic algorithm;multicourse student grade;software project practice teaching","","0","","7","","","","25-28 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The theory of liner combination is applied to generate the keys using the random vectors in vector group. In order to validate such positive effects of the proposed scheme, simulations are performed on the software of Matlab7.1. The results of simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme has better performances to improve the resilience to node capture of the networks and reduces the memory and communication overhead than that of key pre-distribution schemes.","","POD:978-1-4244-3520-3","10.1109/ICCSE.2009.5228436","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5228436","key management scheme;liner combination of vector group;wireless sensor networks","Computer network management;Conference management;Engineering management;Information security;Memory management;Performance analysis;Public key;Resilience;Technology management;Wireless sensor networks","cryptography;telecommunication network management;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Matlab7.1;key management scheme;key predistribution schemes;security capacity;wireless sensor networks","","1","","12","","","","25-28 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An early step was to establish a baseline of graduate education by surveying 28 master's programs in software engineering. The survey was largely limited to US schools. Key findings showed that the universities viewed software engineering largely as a specialization of computer science, that faculty size is generally small with few dedicated professors, and that new master's programs continue to start despite the decrease in computer science majors over the past few years. We used the IEEE Computer Society's Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) to structure our analysis of the 28 curricula, focusing primarily on courses and topics required or semirequired of all students. (A course is semirequired if there is at least a 50 percent chance a student must take it.) Major findings show wide variation in the depth and breadth of SWEBOK coverage in required and semirequired courses, less than 40 percent of all programs requiring an introductory course on software engineering, and many universities having required and semirequired courses that are peripheral to SWEBOK.","0740-7459;07407459","","10.1109/MS.2009.133","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5222804","SWEBOK;Software Engineering Body of Knowledge;computer science education;curriculum;software engineering","Aerospace engineering;Automotive engineering;Collaboration;Computer science;Educational institutions;Educational programs;Radio access networks;Software engineering;Systems engineering and theory;Taxonomy","computer science education;educational courses;software engineering","computer science specialization;educational course;graduate education;master degree;software engineering;university program","","8","","8","","","","Sept.-Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One of the knowledge management (KM) cornerstones is improving productivity by effective knowledge sharing and transfer. However, from the game theory perspective, the main constraint is that people tend not to collaborate in uncertainty conditions, when collaborative behavior is not guaranteed, and sharing knowledge is time- and effort-consuming. Therefore, KM must be a practical aspect of the general organizational culture. Specifically, software development is a knowledge-intensive activity and its success depends heavily on the developers' knowledge and experience. In this presentation we highlight how the agile approach initiates a culture change that is in line with the culture change needed for a KM initiative. We discuss KM enablers that are embedded in the agile software engineering approach, and illustrate how collaborating processes and knowledge transparency can weaken the dilemmas people face and lead to better knowledge extraction and sharing.","","POD:978-1-4244-3712-2","10.1109/CHASE.2009.5071412","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5071412","","Asset management;Collaboration;Educational products;Educational technology;Employee rights;Industrial engineering;Knowledge management;Laboratories;Programming;Uncertainty","knowledge acquisition;knowledge management;software engineering","agile software development;agile software engineering;game theory;knowledge extraction;knowledge management;knowledge sharing;knowledge transfer;knowledge transparency;knowledge-intensive activity","","9","","22","","","","17-17 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The theory of HHT is briefly reviewed and it is proposed to identify the modal parameters of structure using measured free vibration time histories. For a multiple-degree-offreedom (MDOF) system under free vibration, the structural response is first decomposed into modal responses using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) approach. Then, the Hilbert transform is applied to identify the natural frequency and damping ratio of each mode. Finally, this method is applied to identify the modal parameters of a free steel beam in laboratory. Responses of the beam are recorded by nine accelerometers. The free vibration response is obtained from the measured response using random decrement technique (RDT). Results indicate that the natural frequencies and damping ratios of structure can be identified by HHT, based on a single measurement at one appropriate location. These results are also compared with those obtained using Fourier analysis and DHMA modal analysis software. The HHT method is effective and suitable for structural modal parameter identification.","","POD:978-0-7695-3563-0","10.1109/ETTandGRS.2008.384","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5070441","","Accelerometers;Damping;Frequency measurement;History;Laboratories;Modal analysis;Steel;Structural beams;Time measurement;Vibration measurement","Hilbert transforms;beams (structures);parameter estimation;random processes;steel;structural engineering;vibrations","Hilbert-Huang transform;accelerometer;empirical mode decomposition approach;free steel beam;free vibration response;multiple-degree-of-freedom system;random decrement technique;structural modal parameter identification;structural response","","1","","8","","","","21-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become an established tool for the design and understanding of practical combustion systems. Multidimensional models have proven their value in reducing the need for physical experimentation, the benefit of which has been a reduction in product development time and cost. All features and capabilities of the original KIVA-3 have been retained. The grid generator, K3PREP, has been expanded to support the generation of grids with valves, along with the shaping of valve ports and runners. Graphics output options have also been expanded and the new features are discussed. Since in a real diesel engine the wall temperature are not constant, but varied over the cycle, energy equation in standard KIVA-code is modified because of effect of wall heat. Since the shape of piston (4JB1) is not on the axis of symmetry, 360deg was modeled which corresponds x-offset 4 mm and y-offset 1 mm. Finally, schematic of the test bench configuration and engine specification are showed, cylinder pressures and the corresponding heat release rates with variation of injection timing are compared with experimental data.

It also presents a performance optimization based on these optimal thresholds. For multi-branch switched diversity systems, the optimal fixed switching threshold is not only a function of the average channel SNR but also a function of the number of diversity branches. Conventional multi-branch switched diversity systems use a single fixed switching threshold, where computing this optimal threshold is not a simple task when the number of diversity branches is high. We propose a novel multi-branch switched diversity system that is based on a set of adaptive switching thresholds instead of a single fixed switching threshold, where a different switching threshold is used every switching. Thanks to the fact that each switching threshold in the set depends only on the remaining diversity branches, the proposed system allows a simple optimization for these switching thresholds. Furthermore, numerical and simulation results show that the proposed adaptive switched diversity system outperforms the conventional system.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2069-8; POD:978-1-4244-2068-1","10.1109/ISITA.2008.4895613","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4895613","","Application software;Communication switching;Computer science education;Diversity methods;Diversity reception;Educational programs;Electronic mail;Information theory;Radio frequency;Systems engineering education","diversity reception;telecommunication switching;wireless channels","adaptive optimal fixed switching threshold;average channel SNR;multibranch switched diversity system;performance optimization","","1","","10","","","","7-10 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Corp., El Segundo, CA","IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine","20090306","2009","24","2","34","43","The Aerospace Institute of The Aerospace Corporation is developing an electronic classroom (E-class) concept whereby laptop computers are used for the student-content interface, eliminating the need for hardcopy course notebooks and allowing for a more interactive student learning environment. This interactive method is especially useful for space systems education and instruction involving hands-on tool usage and team projects. The objectives, procedures, design and development, and application experiences for this concept are documented herein. The E-class concept is part of a larger Aerospace Institute plan to make available synchronous and asynchronous learning materials via electronic media. The broader scope of this effort includes the recording and broadcast of live classes, the creation of a course content repository for anytime, anywhere corporate Web access, and the E-class concept discussed. Students benefit by being exposed to hands-on usage of principal system engineering tools and processes in a team-project environment. The integration of this interactive approach within the context of space system engineering instruction provides immediate demonstration and reinforcement of principal concepts, procedures, and tool usage benefits and issues. These benefits are exemplified by application of E-class methods to a Space Systems Concept Development course. There are other factors that play into the corporation's consideration of changing the current instructor lecture via course-hook-based instruction, using a single computer/projector system, to a classroom populated by student laptop computers. Besides the interactive advantages mentioned above, the E-class concept permits students to view and annotate course materials on their individual laptops, browse in real-time to research resources online, and work on single or group exercises. The institute's Training and Development Representatives and instructors also benefit by allowing students to take test- s and complete evaluation forms online. These capabilities provide significant advantages over the current classroom instructional format. There are, of course, trade-offs realized by applying the E-class concept in terms of the workload on the administrative and technical staffs. On the one hand, less time is spent on document creation, editing, and reproduction. The E-class concept, however, requires computer skills, software, and keyboard time in excess of the traditional course delivery method. The E-class concept, as implemented by the Aerospace Corporation, consists of a dedicated server, individual student laptop computers, and power and network connectivity via distributed classroom floor-wired hubs. This hub arrangement allows pod-configuration seating of the students that facilitates a team working-group environment. The concept is mobile between several candidate classrooms. Student computers are set up in preparation for each class and torn down and stored so that classrooms may be scheduled for other purposes, as well.","0885-8985;08858985","","10.1109/MAES.2009.4798990","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4798990","","Aerospace electronics;Aerospace materials;Application software;Broadcasting;Computer aided instruction;Computer interfaces;Computer science education;Disk recording;Portable computers;Systems engineering and theory","aerospace computing;computer aided instruction;educational courses;human computer interaction;interactive systems","administrative staff;aerospace institute;asynchronous learning material;computer skill;corporate Web access;document creation;document editing;document reproduction;electronic classroom concept;electronic media;hands-on tool usage;interactive space system education;student laptop computer;team project;technical staff","","0","","4","","","","Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The study investigates how these educators would like the technical content of a state of the art RF laboratory to be designed. As far as the authors know, no publication exists in the literature that investigates the requirements and needs of remote laboratories in that particular field. The outcomes of this work are expected to guide remote laboratory platform developers towards the most effective design of their platforms. The analysis of the results showed that educators would like the technical content of the laboratory to cover basic communication techniques, microwave circuits and devices, antennas and propagation, RF technology, and radio system design aspects of modern telecommunication systems. They would therefore like the laboratory instrumentation to be designed to that end. The educators also reported the need for advanced experimental setups which require expensive RF measurement devices.

"Development of softwares for teaching electromagnetics","Y. Akhtar; R. Garg","E & ECE Deptt., IIT Kharagpur, India","2008 International Conference on Recent Advances in Microwave Theory and Applications","20090127","2008","","","278","278","Summary form only given. The students are by and large averse to electromagnetics. The reasons for this could vary from: the subject is highly conceptual, to students dislike for vector calculus, to lack of visualization of vector fields. Unlike subjects such as mechanics where one can visualize the subject through common experience, electromagnetics involve electric and magnetic fields which can be measured but cannot be seen. Electromagnetics would thus require the mental ability to visualize without which understanding of concepts not readily apparent from equations, would become difficult; leading to disinterest in the subject. Although the electromagnetic fields cannot be seen, they can be at least computed and presented graphically in colour; and thus help in visualization. With these points in mind, we have tried to understand and develop tools for simulation and visual presentation of certain physical phenomenon in electromagnetics. One may use computational methods to develop softwares specifically for teaching. The computational techniques such as finite difference, FDTD, FEM, MoM, etc may be employed for this purpose. The FDTD method is found to be most interesting for teaching because it produces animation of wave propagation; which is the basis of high frequency electromagnetics. The development of softwares based on FDTD is a highly skilled job, and the simulation results differ slightly from the expected results because of discretization errors. We have used Matlab for generating data related to various physical phenomenon, and used its movie feature to play those frames repeatedly to generate the effect of wave propagation, reflection, transmission etc in one-dimension. The basic approach used for the development of softwares will be presented.","","POD:978-1-4244-2690-4","10.1109/AMTA.2008.4763260","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4763260","","Calculus;Education;Electric variables measurement;Electromagnetic fields;Electromagnetic measurements;Finite difference methods;Magnetic field measurement;Mechanical variables measurement;Time domain analysis;Visualization","electromagnetism;finite difference time-domain analysis;finite element analysis;software engineering;teaching","FDTD;FEM;computational methods;discretization errors;electromagnetics;finite difference;mental ability;software development;teaching;wave propagation","","0","","","","","","21-24 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The education world is experiencing a change not just in terms of curriculum but also in terms of approaches to teaching and learning strategies. These changes in learning strategies from traditional to dynamic strategies based on the use of information technology create a learner centered learning environment. The most important role of an instructor in an online environment is a high degree of interactivity and participation. This means designing and conducting learning activities that result in engagement with the subject matter and with fellow learners using proper pedagogical approaches are very important.The development of e-Learning in the sciences in general and in mathematics in particular has not met the general expectations. The instructional design of the teaching of mathematics incorporates the elements on mathematical approaches, hierarchy of teaching, interactive multimedia, systematically designed and developed teaching and learning modules and sub modules, and holistic development of students OO (Object-Oriented) analysis and design techniques were developed to help in the modeling of business, the analysis of requirements and the design software. With the rapid growth of OO technology, a number of techniques in OO have been developed and integrated. UML was designed to bring together the best feature of a number of analysis and design techniques and notations to produce an industry standard.The unified modeling language (UML) is an effective and popular notation which is used to capture high-level designs for software systems. However, one aspect of software system design which is not typically captured in a UML document is a record of the likely (or desired) rate of performance of the major activities of the system. When this information is not included in the initi- - al UML description of a system it increases the likelihood that the performance of the software system being developed will not be considered until very late in the software development process.","2154-7491;21547491","POD:978-0-7695-3489-3","10.1109/ICACTE.2008.15","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4737126","","Education;Educational technology;Fellows;Information technology;Internet;Learning systems;Mathematics;Software design;Software systems;Unified modeling language","Internet;Unified Modeling Language;computer aided instruction;distance learning;mathematics computing;multimedia computing;natural sciences computing;object-oriented methods;software engineering;teaching","Internet technology;UML description;Unified Modeling Language;Web-based learning system;interactive multimedia;learner centered learning environment;mathematical instruction;mathematics teaching;object-oriented approach;pedagogical approach;software development process;software system","","0","","25","","","","20-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The classical approach consists of three phases: 1) Presentation of an interesting engineering problem by the instructor, 2) Solution of the problem by students, resulting in the generation of a ldquotheoretical expectationrdquo usually represented graphically in the form of a sketch, and 3) Computer simulation of the problem with the aim of verifying the theoretical expectation. The approach presents a potential problem: students with less power of abstraction often get frustrated when they cannot generate a theoretical expectation, so they tend to skip phase 2), in an attempt to use computer simulation as a substitute for thinking. If the instructor allows this to happen, interactive teaching fails. To solve the above problem, I incorporated student-teams into the interactive learning process. In each team, a student with strong power of abstraction operates as the leader. She or he leads the discussion to generate a theoretical expectation.

The maintenance of web applications is also one of the main problems in that area. Traditional maintenance approach can no longer be applied to web applications, because of the specific characteristics of web applications. In this paper, a complexity measure for web application, WCOX, is proposed. It is related to the maintenance efforts. WCOX is defined using the entropy theory and a web model extracted by static analysis. The entropy of software is regarded as an average information quantity of the software and it means the aging and degradation of the software. Most of the existing web complexity measures are simply based on count, which means that they only show limited viewpoints of a system. Since WCOX is concerned with an information quantity and understandability, it not only represents the structural complexity, but can also be used as a practical maintenance indicator. Experimental results demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed measure.","1530-1362;15301362","POD:978-0-7695-3446-6","10.1109/APSEC.2008.23","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724585","","Aging;Application software;Computer science;Computer science education;Degradation;Entropy;Object oriented modeling;Software engineering;Software maintenance;Software measurement","Internet;entropy;software maintenance","WCOX;Web applications;complexity metric;entropy theory;maintenance efforts;static analysis;structural complexity","","2","","38","","","","3-5 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This can be an issue when the target is a bioengineering course that introduces classical control theory, fuzzy logic, neural networks, genetic algorithms and genetic programming through the use of a low cost robot, personal digital assistant (PDA) handheld computer, and custom PDA software. In this course, the concepts and theories discussed in lecture are reinforced and extended in a corresponding laboratory through the use of wireless robots and PDAs. Fuzzy logic libraries and software modules for laptops and desktop computers are readily available, however, when it comes to handheld computers no such libraries exist. Students are able to spend more time experimenting with different fuzzy logic controllers when a custom fuzzy logic library and PDA graphical user interface are utilized.

A key component to an effective demonstration is active student engagement throughout the entire process. This means students are involved in discussing the purpose of the demo; predicting what will happen during the demo; discussing who developed theories to help us understand what happens during the demo; and comparing observations to predictions, as opposed to simply passively watching a demonstration. This paper presents a model for infusing demonstrations into an engineering science class and the use of this model during a semester.

This research believes that a contributing factor to the undesired outcomes (i.e., low performing teams and high levels of conflict) of software engineering teams is that the teams were not formed using ldquorelevant and salientrdquo criteria. To address the relevance issue, we test the impact of problem solving preferences (a sub-set of the MBTI scale) on group conflict and performance. We then test the extent to which the numerical dominance (i.e., salience) of problem solving styles influences conflict and performance. It was found that dominance of problem solving styles is related to negative team outcomes. We conclude by discussing ways in which instructors and team members may minimize negative team outcomes when there is no choice other than forming a team with one dominant problem solving preference.","0190-5848;01905848","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1970-8; POD:978-1-4244-1969-2","10.1109/FIE.2008.4720498","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4720498","MBTI;Numerical Dominance;Problem Solving Style;Team Diversity;Team Dynamics","Buildings;Demography;Information technology;Problem-solving;Programming;Software design;Software engineering;Teamwork;Technological innovation;Testing","computer science education;software engineering","computer science education;group conflict;performance outcome;problem solving preference;software engineering team assignment","","2","","25","","","","22-25 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through our experience in teaching communication theories in CS456/556, a software engineering course at Ohio University, we observed that when communication theories are delivered in traditional methods such as lectures without additional exercises designed for students to apply the theories, many students tend to treat them as an independent part of the course and continue to guide their behaviors in team activities with their old habits and preexisting intuitions. We found that issue tracking tools can help facilitate student learning of communication skills by forcing students to explicitly carry out effective steps recommended by communication theories and thus improve communications among students. Moreover, issue tracking tools also improve communications between the students and the instructor, and enable the instructor to be more aware of team status, detect team problems early on, and reply less on time-consuming and often inaccurate in-class team status reports","1093-0175;10930175","POD:0-7695-2324-2","10.1109/CSEET.2005.40","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698909","","Computer science;Education;Educational institutions;Feedback;Programming;Software design;Software engineering;Software tools;Teamwork;Unified modeling language","behavioural sciences;computer science education;educational courses;software engineering;teaching;team working","Ohio University;communication skills teaching;issue tracking tools;lectures;software engineering courses;student behavior;student exercises;student interactions;student learning;team activities;team problems;team status;teamwork skills teaching","","4","","9","","","","18-20 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve this goal, the authors first present WFPI, workflow pi-calculus. By adding task execution and submission primitives, and tagging each agent with its executing and distributing tasks, WFPI can flexibly represent the concepts and elements in workflow systems. Then, based on WFPI, a type system is proposed to ensure that the well-typed workflow systems can abide by the TBAC policy at run time, by avoiding run-time access violations. To the best of onepis knowledge, the present research is the first attempt to study workflow access control by process calculus and types.","1751-8806;17518806","","10.1049/iet-sen:20070098","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4657468","","","authorisation;pi calculus;task analysis;type theory;workflow management software","TBAC policy;WFPI-workflow pi-calculus;run-time access violation avoidance;security mechanism;task execution;task-based access control;type system;workflow management system;workflow security policy","","2","","","","","","October 2008","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

For such support a specification language to describe search patterns for typical solution patterns in student exercises has been created. This language especially supports the structured description of complex search patterns. The specified patterns are transformed into graph rules, which are applied to student solutions in our testing support environment. The approach extends the work we presented in [5].

The main game runs on the teacherpsilas portable PC projected on a large screen, whereas the students will interact with the game using their own mobile phones. Lecture Quiz is a multiplayer quiz game, which offers a variation in game modes where unlimited number of players can play simultaneously. Games like Lecture Quiz are most useful for testing and rehearsing theory. As a bonus, the teacher will get quantitative data on how much of the theory the students actually have learned. The evaluation of Lecture Quiz was performed in a software architecture lecture where twenty students first played the game and then were asked to fill in an evaluation form. The focus of the evaluation was on usability of the system and the perceived usefulness of using Lecture Quiz in lectures. The results of the evaluation show that Lecture Quiz was easy to use and that it contributed to increased learning.

The current talk reports on work that starts with a pressing social problem - the problem of maximizing equity and excellence in K-12 education - and one strategy for addressing this problem - the development of mobile, wirelessly connected tools to support classroom learning. It mentions the development and use in real classrooms of two suites of such tools (one for middle school math and one for 5-11 th grade science). The practice of using these wirelessly connected, mobile devices raised important theoretical issues about the nature of coordination and the computational support for coordination. We have been using tuple spaces (a framework for allocating work between parallel distributed actors) to build systems that explore the opportunistic control of the individual over their own actions, socially emergent negotiation of system goals and coordinative practices, and the relationship between content and coordination. These control structures and the contribution of the machine as compared to human participants are better described by analogy to playground games than to work situations. This analogy (along with the values it presupposes) is at variance with the object world of software engineers, which foregrounds the capabilities of the machine rather than the situation of use.","","POD:0-7695-2942-9","10.1109/PLT.2007.31","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4488853","","Control systems;Educational institutions;Humans;Mobile computing;Pressing","computer aided instruction;mobile computing;mobile radio","K-12 education;classroom learning;computational coordination support;tuple spaces;wireless mobile devices","","0","","","","","","4-5 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed platform consists of a reconfigurable power electronics testbed, a Web-based distance laboratory, and a user interactive e-learning platform. The reconfigurable power electronics testbed can be configured by the students via a Web- based interface to construct a wide variety of converters and inverters. The Internet accessible distance laboratory system permits the instructors and students to remotely conduct experiments over the Internet. The integrated interactive multimedia material can support the educational environment of power electronics courses and can be executed on any modern personal computer (PC) without additional hardware.

It is highly believe that SWE is an umbrella course in computing and most dangerously in any course proclaimed to be specialist in generating Software Engineers. Unfortunately, this may still not be widely recognized, both in the industry and in academia. The modern course on SWE requires that the student is familiar not just with many aspects of computing such as programming languages but rather with many other aspects including networking, Internet technologies, programming languages, databases, Human Computer Interaction (HCI), computer graphics, and project management. Depending on the year of academic study these expectations could be unrealistic, especially if that is a 2nd year course. Based on the above view, it is essential to investigate what are the necessary attributes of an ideal Software Engineering at the undergraduate level and how much it is covering of the requirements imposed by the business and industry market. This paper will investigate how appropriate are Software Engineering courses at the undergraduate level in terms of the areas of concentration, delivery approach, and the real life practical training received by the target group of students. It will deeply investigate the overall intended learning objectives and how they are related to the choice of modules offered. On the other hand, a number of business institutions will be surveyed for achieving an overview of how effective graduates of Software engineering courses are within these selected institutions and most importantly what are the challenges they encounter in professional life given their level of university education i.e. how helpful their undergraduate education has been helpful to their development as specialists.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1752-0; POD:978-1-4244-1751-3","10.1109/ICTTA.2008.4529922","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529922","Software Engineering Education","Computer graphics;Computer industry;Computer languages;Computer networks;Databases;Human computer interaction;IP networks;Industrial training;Project management;Software engineering","computer science education;software engineering;training","Jordanian Business Institutions;learning objectives;practical training;programming languages;undergraduate software engineering courses","","0","","","","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"<?Pub Dtl?>A Consideration of the Use of Plagiarism Tools for Automated Student Assessment","O. H. Graven; L. M. MacKinnon","Dept. of Technol., Buskerud Univ. Coll., Kongsberg","IEEE Transactions on Education","20080507","2008","51","2","212","219","In this paper, the authors evaluate the flexibility and richness of two well-established text analysis plagiarism tools, through a consideration of the use of plagiarism detection software as a mechanism for the automated assessment of student-created narrative in a virtual learning environment (VLE). The authors are currently engaged in a project creating a prototype VLE, using technologies for multilevel and multiplayer games, based on the inherent support such an environment would provide for constructivist learning, engagement, and contextual socialization. Progress between levels in the VLE will be based on the creation, by the student, of a narrative linking together a number of conceptual elements obtained through game-play at that level. Support for the narrative creation process will help the student to contextualize the conceptual elements, providing the necessary linking elements or themes to enable the student to produce a coherent description of their understanding of the concepts. A particular challenge in such environments is the need for fast, real-time feedback to students to maintain the level of engagement and to support the game-play metaphor. Additionally, the student must be able to make as many attempts to progress as they need and it will be their decision when and how often to submit for assessment. Since the student narrative will be in a textual form and can therefore be related to a sample solution narrative, generated by the author of the level within the learning environment, the idea of using plagiarism detection software as the mechanism for automated comparison and assessment was considered appropriate for investigation. While the limitation of such tools would appear to be that they are seeking direct copies of text elements, the authors wanted to investigate whether they offered sufficient richness and fuzziness to detect common conceptually-linked texts. The initial decision was to experiment with text-analytic tools, since they a- re both widely used and readily available. The tools chosen were TurnItIn, a commercial tool provided to the U.K. higher education community by the U.K. Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC), and VALT/VAST, a set of tools created at the Centre for Interactive Systems Engineering at London South Bank University, London, U.K., the workings of which are based on recognized and well-published research. An experiment using a small group of students in a traditional assessment situation was carried out, and is described in detail. The rationale for this approach was that there is not yet a fully working prototype of the VLE in which to carry out such an experiment, but that the conditions necessary to test the hypothesis that plagiarism tools could be utilized for such a purpose could be replicated sufficiently to make such an experiment viable. The results of the experiment demonstrated neither a correlation between the sample solution and student solutions, nor any correlation between the individual student solutions, proving the null hypothesis. This result demonstrates that these tools are not useful for the development of automated assessment within the VLE, and the authors are now giving consideration to the use of lexical analysis/tokenizer and other tools. However, it also suggests that these text-analytic plagiarism tools are too firmly focused on direct copy, which does raise the question of whether or not they offer enough richness and fuzziness to detect a sophisticated plagiarism attempt using, for example, text replacement tools. An ongoing close relationship between research in automated assessment and plagiarism detection is also proposed, to achieve mutual benefit.","0018-9359;00189359","","10.1109/TE.2007.914940","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4472096","Automated assessment;formative and summative assessment;games-based virtual learning environment;plagiarism detection tools;student-created-narrative-based assessment","Feedback;Information systems;Interactive systems;Joining processes;Plagiarism;Prototypes;Software prototyping;Software tools;Systems engineering and theory;Text analysis","computer aided instruction;computer games;copyright;educational administrative data processing;groupware;text analysis","TurnItIn tools;automated student assessment;multilevel games;multiplayer games;narrative creation process;plagiarism detection software;text analysis plagiarism tools;virtual learning environment","","7","","22","","","","May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

So the different aspects can be specified by one formal specification technique or different formal specification techniques. In this paper we provide some ideas for aspect- oriented formal specification of multimedia systems. Multimedia systems can be divided into different aspects, each aspect can be specified independently. After each aspect has been accomplished, it can be woven back to the system.

The multidisciplinary nano and microengineering have accomplished a phenomenal growth over the last twenty years due to the rapid advances in microelectronics, molecular technologies, bulk and surface micromachining, computer-aided-design (CAD), etc. Recent fundamental and applied research and developments in molecular electronics and informatics have been notably contributed to the current progress. Enabling nano/micro engineering utilizes and depends on the fundamentals, software and hardware. These prominent developments largely depend on modern engineering and science providing the end-users with the needed technologies and design concurrency. With the increasing demands in high-performance envisioned nanosystems and emerged microsystems, designers apply new concepts. The role of nanotechnology and MEMS courses in the engineering curriculum is examined. We discuss the integration of design, optimization, control and analysis topics in Nano Science, Engineering and Technology (NanoSET) and MEMS courses. The MEMS curriculum consists of three courses, e.g., MEMS design, MEMS fabrication and MEMS systems evaluation. We stress the need for systems theory, in addition to basic fundamentals coverage and fabrication emphasis. The developed courses ensure the overall educational, professional and curriculum objectives.","0191-2216;01912216","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1498-7; POD:978-1-4244-1497-0","10.1109/CDC.2007.4434477","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4434477","","Control systems;Design engineering;Design optimization;Educational institutions;Fabrication;Microelectromechanical systems;Microelectronics;Micromachining;Micromechanical devices;Nanotechnology","control engineering education;educational courses;electronic engineering education;micromechanical devices;nanotechnology","CAD;MEMS course;Nano Science, Engineering and Technology;computer-aided-design;engineering curriculum;microelectromechanical systems;microelectronics;microengineering;molecular electronics;molecular technologies;nanoengineering;nanotechnology course;surface micromachining","","2","","18","","","","12-14 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The software is a client/server platform developed in Java programming language, which is termed platform for adaptive and reliable evaluation of students (PARES). Hypertext markup language is used for the development of pages including text and figures. PARES includes three modules, which can be remotely connected to the system database on server through network. The Bayesian decision model is applied to adaptive testing, instead of the traditional item response theory. PARES can be used interactively by administrators, course instructors and students. When PARES is used for self-assessment, feedback is provided to the student's answer. As a result, personalized learning assistance is provided to improve a student's level of proficiency. Experimental results show that when students take self-assessment tests a week before scheduled formative tests, their scores are increased.","0190-5848;01905848","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1084-2; POD:978-1-4244-1083-5","10.1109/FIE.2007.4417979","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4417979","Computerized adaptive assessment;self-assessment","Adaptive systems;Automatic testing;Computer architecture;Computer languages;Databases;Education;Educational programs;Java;Markup languages;Network servers","Java;belief networks;client-server systems;computer aided instruction;hypermedia markup languages","Bayesian decision model;Java programming language;PARES;adaptive assessment tool;client-server platform;education quality;educational society;hypertext markup language;personalized learning assistance","","6","","17","","","","10-13 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the globalization lecture delivered within undergraduate software engineering courses, the students were prompted with different discussion questions involving products that were successful in the American market, yet failed in a foreign market. Students thought mainly of politically correct rationale as a means of explaining why the products were not globally successful. While the students began to develop an understanding of what globalization meant and its effect on product design during the lecture, afterwards they failed to incorporate this knowledge into their subsequent software designs.

Embedded systems present several idiosyncrasies that make their development more difficult and complex than desktop solutions, namely when considering non-functional requirements, time-related deadlines, or the correctness of the solution. To be well prepared for their professions, students of software-oriented computing degrees must acquire skills and competencies in embedded systems engineering. Being able to master high-level programming languages and to develop solutions only for desktop computers means that the students cannot consider numerous opportunities, after graduation.

However, freshman students do not yet have the capability to predict the mechanical behavior of their designs. Commercial analysis software is available, but teaching the students to use the software is far beyond the scope of a freshman engineering course. As a result, the students utilize a trial and error approach to design, leaving the students a lasting misimpression of the engineering design process. Simple analysis software was written and implemented to predict the mechanical behavior of the student-designed parts with the intent of instilling a more professional design practice at the freshman level. This allows the students to modify their designs accordingly to improve performance. The software was designed specifically for the freshman design project in order to simplify use and to limit its applicability to other design problems. The software has now been implemented in the classroom. After one semester of use, statistical tests do not indicate a significant difference in design strength, but freshman students are becoming actively engaged in a professional engineering design process.","0190-5848;01905848","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1084-2; POD:978-1-4244-1083-5","10.1109/FIE.2007.4417806","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4417806","Design analysis;Design process;Finite element analysis;Freshman design","Design engineering;Design optimization;Educational institutions;Engineering education;Engineering profession;Finite element methods;Process design;Software design;Software testing;Systems engineering and theory","CAD;computer aided instruction;educational institutions;engineering education;finite element analysis;mechanical engineering computing;supports","Grand Valley State University;engineering design process;finite element analysis;freshman level engineering analysis software;mechanical behavior;strength to weight ratio;support bracket","","0","","","","","","10-13 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper addresses issues that may underpin some of this transformational process. It mentions some of the underlying assumptions regarding the situation and explores the affect of curricula reports in computer science, computer engineering, information systems, information technology, and software engineering as published by ACM and the computer society of IEEE. (Both authors have co-authored some of these documents.) From these reports, the paper explores the framework of new curricula models based on broad strategies for creating or developing a curriculum from organization and orientation points of view. Considerations for these new models would include not only topic areas, but also contrasts between traditional and novel approaches. While the paper addresses some structural models, it also explores integrative approaches such as absorption and separatist models as well as modular frameworks and negotiated programs.

To increase the interactivity of computer science education, we have developed RegExpert, a tool for regular language manipulation and visualization. The main goal of the RegExpert tool is to simplify and visually present complex concepts and mathematical models of automata theory fundamentals.

Various peripherals were available in limited quantity. Approximate prices are given to convey a feeling for the investment required. The support software consisted of a keyboard monitor evolved locally from the original SDK-80 version by INTEL, a cross assembler on the Naval Academy Time-Sharing system (NATS) which was developed as a midshipman project, and edit and file processing software on NATS, all of which aided in program development. The objectives of the course were that the student should write assembly language programs for real-time applications in an interrupt-driven environment, be exposed to interfacing techniques, and attempt to immerse the microcomputer in an analog environment.

This procedure is called the parse-implement (systems level-environmental level) design approach. The features of this approach are outlined with the presentation of six fundamental considerations of digital system design within the context of the systems level language. The applicability of this approach is demonstrated by means of an example design problem for which both a hardware and a software solution are generated.

A free software package named Jini orchestrates computers on a network, which we coupled with simBio. We connected 11 PCs and found that the time required for computing 504 models became 13 times shorter than that with a single PC. This method was proved efficient for sensitivity analysis, because calculations are independent and a linear decrease of computation time was obtained by adding PCs to the cluster. The visualization feature gives a researcher an instant feed-back, thus this system accelerates model driven study.

In a graduate degree in software engineering, the development of a compiler contributes significantly to the developer's comprehension of the practical application of theoretical concepts. Different formal notations are commonly used to define type systems, and some of them are used to teach the semantic analysis phase of language processing. In the traditional approach, attribute grammars are probably the most widely used ones. This paper shows how object-oriented design patterns represented in unified modeling language (UML) can be used to both teach type systems and develop the semantic analysis phase of a compiler. The main benefit of this approach is two-fold: better comprehension of theoretical concepts because of the use of notations known by the students (UML diagrams), and improvement of software engineering skills for the development of a complete language processor.","0018-9359;00189359","","10.1109/TE.2007.901983","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4287122","Compiler construction;design pattern;semantic analysis;software engineering;type checker;type system","Application software;Computer languages;Computer science;Education;Object oriented programming;Pattern analysis;Production;Program processors;Software engineering;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;computer science education;program compilers;software engineering","Unified Modeling Language;compiler construction course;language processor;semantic analysis;software engineering;teaching type checking","","9","","23","","","","Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

GSEEM has been designed with three noteworthy aspects: 1) Three specialization profiles in which the consortium excels: Software Architecting, Real-time Embedded Systems Engineering, and Web Systems and Services Engineering. 2) Two market-driven routes: ""professional"" to work as professionals, and ""scientific"" to continue the education towards research degrees. 3) An innovative concept of ""shared modules"", delivered together by multiple institutions. Four types of shared modules are foreseen: ""parallel"" twin modules which run remotely between universities, ""shifted"" modules which teach SE concepts incrementally with shifts in study locations and timeline ,""complementary"" modules in which complementary SE concepts are taught in parallel through shared projects, and ""common"" modules which share the presentations and the project. The profiles realize ""integrated knowledge"" by complementing partial knowledge available at partner institutions.

The rapid evolution of core computing, communication, and interface technologies means that systems architects are presented with palettes of powerful functions and rarely need to resort to development of deep-core layers. This creates a greater need for systems engineers who can, in an optimal fashion, exploit commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software in order to meet design requirements subject to constraints largely defined by time and cost. Current systems engineers have achieved their titles largely through experience. While there exist undergraduate and graduate SE programs-and those numbers are increasing-education practices haven't kept up. Electrical and computer engineering (ECE) programs-the source of the largest cadre of engineers able to deal with both hardware and software-remains characterized by the significant amounts of attention paid to details, with relatively little treatment of the SE perspective. This paper describes an approach, which we term Macro Systems, that can be adapted to a broad spectrum of core ECE courses with the result that students can be exposed to SE concepts on a continual, progressive, and appropriate basis.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-1041-X; POD:1-4244-1040-1","10.1109/SYSTEMS.2007.374689","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258894","","Biology computing;Design engineering;Hardware;Maintenance engineering;Mathematics;Pervasive computing;Power engineering and energy;Software maintenance;Software systems;Systems engineering and theory","educational courses;engineering education;systems engineering","commercial off-the-shelf hardware;commercial off-the-shelf software;communication;core computing;education;interface technologies;macrosystems;undergraduate engineering courses","","0","","7","","","","9-13 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Analytical methods are introduced to evaluate the queue-length, wait-time and completion-duration. The case study (especially the case of airline ticket booking application) shows that WFQN can model real-world workflow-based applications effectively.

However, implementation of only a part of functions using well-designed evaluation platforms is not generally appropriate to fulfill students' motivation and achievement. In this paper, we introduce a successful example of an undergraduate capstone design project that designs and implements ubiquitous sensor network base station controller and monitoring program. Our prerequisite courses provide substantial background for embedded system hardware design and implementation, wireless network, and embedded software, so that the students do not suffer from lack of implementation techniques rather than their creativity and challenges for the design goal. In addition, the capstone design project course has one-to-one mentor-mentee relation with companies, specifically with Samsung Data System for this project.

The three applications presented and discussed are machine loading and unloading, kindergarten painting, and Kool-Aid mixing. The machine loading and unloading application consists of integrating the robot arm with a CNC machining center by designing and fabricating an automatic clamping device to hold the part that is being machined, designing and building a control system to operate the clamping device in automatic or manual control mode, and programming the robot arm and the CNC machining center for automatic loading and unloading the parts and machining the part respectively. The kindergarten painting consists of programming the robot arm to paint the first letter of four students' first names, spelling ""KATE"". A significant element of this application was to design and fabricate a fixture to house the paint containers and other apparatus interfacing with the robot. The design requirements for the fixture were to effectively house four containers for storing paints and water, and to be stable so that there was no risk of spillage. The fixture was created in 3-D, solid modeling computer software and was fabricated out of wood using a drill press. Then the robot was programmed to paint ""KATE"" in four different colors - yellow, red, blue, and purple. The Kool-Aid mixing application consists of designing and building a fixture to hold a cup for Kool-Aid mix, cup for sugar, bottle of water, a mixing cup, and a spoon. The fixture was placed directly in the center of the table in front of the robot. Then the robot was programmed to make a cup of Kool-Aid in approximately 3 minutes.

Computer aided training systems offer a flexible and cost-effective method for learning new skills. The satisfactory management of risk situations involves risk identification, the development of risk handling strategies and plans and the conduct and monitoring of those plans. Recognising the importance of tacit knowledge, scenario-based training has gained importance in recent years. For example, USA General Accounting Office (GAO) released a report on Homeland security titled Risk Management approach can guide preparedness efforts. This report provides a list of risk assessment measurements for contingency plan development and a matrix for risk-based scenario development. In this paper, integrating traditional scenario-based training with desktop VR systems using game engineering, we investigate how a virtual reality training system, which draws on research in the areas of computer games, knowledge acquisition, agent technology and natural language processing, can provide a safe learning experience to assist acquisition of the necessary tacit knowledge. The aim of RiskMan is to train police officers to handle high-risk situations. RiskMan is an ARC Discovery project carried out by the Department of Computing in Macquarie University. RiskMan has been developed using a very-high level scripting language of a game engine, Unreal Tournament 2004. It is composed of modules such as a Scenario-based Expert System, a Narrative Engine, a Game Engine, and a CAD package.

Finally, we propose an implementation supporting the identified properties in an existing and widely used software development environment","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0165-8; POD:1-4244-0164-X","10.1109/CSCWD.2006.253203","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4019239","Activity Theory;Collaboration Support;Experience Crystallization;Software Development Environments","Collaborative software;Collaborative tools;Collaborative work;Computer architecture;Computer science education;Crystallization;Humans;International collaboration;Joining processes;Programming","groupware;software engineering","collaboration-aware software development;computer tools;human activity theory;social science theory","","0","","30","","","","3-5 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The study of the modal spectrum of canonical closed waveguides is a basic topic in any course of electromagnetics or microwave engineering. However, surface-wave modes and leaky-wave modes in open waveguides are not yet so well known in the academic environment. Nevertheless, this study is necessary, since novel open dielectric waveguides have been proposed for millimeter-wave and optical electronics in order to reduce the conductor losses. Therefore, the comprehension of the phenomenon of leaky-wave modes and behavior is indispensable for any future microwave engineer, who has to work with the new millimeter-wave and optical technologies. This program constitutes the first tool explicitly conceived to help the teaching of the working principles of open dielectric guides loaded with printed circuits, and the associated practical leaky-wave antennas (LWAs). The code can be a very good supplement to understand how practical leaky-wave antennas work, after a basic theoretical understanding of leaky waves has been first obtained. From the appearance of leaky-wave modes in open waveguides to the design of a backward-to-forward leaky-wave antenna, some simple and very clarifying step-by-step exercises are presented to illustrate these not-so-well-known concepts. Although the program refers to a specific type of open dielectric guides (laterally-shielded, top-open, stub-loaded, rectangular dielectric waveguides with planar perturbations), the results are applicable to any open dielectric guide, helping to teach the basic theory and topics relating to leaky- and surface-wave modes in uniform and periodic structures","1045-9243;10459243","","10.1109/MAP.2006.1715231","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1715231","","Dielectrics;Education;Electromagnetic scattering;Electromagnetic waveguides;Leaky wave antennas;Millimeter wave technology;Optical waveguide theory;Optical waveguides;Surface waves;Waveguide theory","dielectric waveguides;dielectric-loaded waveguides;leaky wave antennas;millimetre wave propagation;rectangular waveguides;waveguide theory","PAMELA;backward-to-forward leaky-wave antenna;canonical closed waveguides;conductor losses;electromagnetic theory;laterally-shielded dielectric waveguide;leaky-wave modes;microwave engineer;millimeter-wave electronics;modal spectrum;optical electronics;periodic structures;planar perturbations;printed circuits;rectangular dielectric waveguides;software tool;strip-loaded open dielectric waveguides;stub-loaded dielectric waveguide;surface-wave modes;top-open dielectric waveguide","","4","","26","","","","4 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our approach to achieving qualities is rooted in process engineering: identifying and performing a set of requirements, design and construction activities, with testing to inspect if the desired product has been obtained, and relying on process optimization over time to help us in defining the right set of activities. In contrast, design in other engineering disciplines is centered on product engineering, systematically engineering in desired qualities through successive stages of development. Process engineering is then applied to this conceptually sound fundamental structure to optimize process performance parameters. This paper asserts that software development can and should be grounded in product engineering, and presents a conceptual model that enables a systematic approach to achieving qualities. Key enablers for this are a clear separation of quality concerns and the use of analysis to validate designs. Analysis techniques for software qualities have been available for many years, yet they are not viewed as basic knowledge in Computer Science and Software Engineering curricula. We argue that to put software engineering education on a firm footing, it is necessary to shift our conceptual basis for software development from process engineering to product engineering.","","POD:0-7695-2647-0","10.1109/CSEETW.2006.2","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1644072","","Acoustical engineering;Computer science;Design engineering;Design optimization;Performance evaluation;Programming;Software engineering;Software quality;Systems engineering and theory;Testing","","","","1","","2","","","","19-21 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The primary pedagogical objective of the project was to provide extensive opportunity for a student to engage in self-directed learning. To this end, a project was chosen that involved image processing, control theory, circuit design, PC interfacing, and software design. A radio controlled vehicle was designed to track predetermined objects using wireless video feedback. The student had no prior knowledge of four of the five engineering principles involved in the system. The system required the control of speed and direction of a radio controlled (RC) vehicle using monocular video images that were wirelessly transmitted to a PC and captured with a video capture card. The camera and video transmitter were mounted on the top of the car. The images were processed on the PC using Visual Basic and vector control was sent to a student-fabricated interface to a handheld RC controller that controlled the speed and direction of the car. A graphical user interface (GUI) was designed to aid in development. It allowed for simplified access to color balance calibration, steering and speed calibration, and image initialization.

We offered an experimental course sequence during Fall 2004 and Spring 2005, defined as a ""learning stream"". A learning stream is a basic element of a novel program structure designed specifically to vertically integrate subject matter across courses. A learning stream merges and re-organizes material to more effectively present and reinforce key objectives. Concepts are covered in a more cohesive and timely manner compared to traditional topical organizations, letting students see relationships between concepts. A learning stream emphasizes fundamentals through their application. In some cases, it provides a basis to introduce cross-disciplinary ideas. Students gain proficiency with higher dimensional problem-solving from a conceptual and disciplinary perspective rather than a single subject. The design of a curriculum using learning streams addresses one of the most important questions in engineering education, that is, how to achieve balance between the fundamentals and applications, between theory and practice.

The paper shows that the global system mobile (GSM) radio interface is well suited to the teaching of estimation and detection theory because it entails the understanding and application of several concepts within estimation and detection, as well as information theory, signal processing, and radio-wave propagation. With GSM now a mature system with specifications available in the public domain, the students created an open-source (OS) GSM simulator, including all four modulation and coding schemes (MCS 1,2,3,4) with puncturing, a channel estimator, a minimum phase prefilter, a Max log maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) equalizer, and a convolutional decoder. Studying and understanding the theory of estimation and detection is now possible by creating algorithms for the simulator and evaluating the impact of the algorithm on the GSM block error rate (BLER). Several experiments that are possible with the simulator are described.","0018-9359;00189359","","10.1109/TE.2005.856153","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593872","Communications;signal processing;teaching detection and estimation","Education;Estimation theory;GSM;Information theory;Modulation coding;Open source software;Phase estimation;Phase modulation;Signal processing;Signal processing algorithms","cellular radio;estimation theory;signal detection;teaching;telecommunication engineering education","GSM radio interface simulation;Global System Mobile;MAP equalizer;Max log maximum a posteriori probability;block error rate;channel estimator;coding scheme;convolutional decoder;detection theory;estimation theory teaching;information theory;minimum phase prefilter;modulation scheme;radio-wave propagation;signal processing","","5","","12","","","","Feb. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The components of the case-based learning modules include not only the requisite problem background, summary and relevant data, but they also include additional streaming video of the real-world process being studied, actual engineering drawings and still photos of the product and process, and a base simulation model.

Information sources can be physical, informational, and cognitive, and include: sensors, shooters, machines, and humans. The authors of this qualitative descriptive study reviewed a sample of open literature which discusses systems engineering and studied the inadequacies that exist in holistic, or integrated, systems engineering. This literature indicates many systems are poorly integrated, stand-alone, single-unit entities. Problems are exacerbated when an attempt is made to integrate multiple systems and/or subsystems. Consequently, from a systems engineering design philosophy perspective, systems should be developed with respect to physical, informational, and cognitive domains. The holistic perspective should include all three domains whether technology is classified as microscopic (small scale-component-subsystems) or macroscopic (large scale-system of systems). The authors conclude a paradigm shift might lead the way to more successful development of systems and technologies which link subsystems, functions, and attributes in one timeline.","2155-7195;21557195","POD:0-7803-9307-4","10.1109/DASC.2005.1563483","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1563483","Systems engineering;architecture;data;domain;information;knowledge;situation awareness","Design engineering;Humans;Microscopy;Systems engineering and theory","engineering education;military systems;software engineering;systems engineering","large scale system of systems;multiple systems integration;small scale component subsystems;systems engineering","","3","","14","","","","30 Oct.-3 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Corp., El Segundo, CA","2005 IEEE Aerospace Conference","20051219","2005","","","4478","4488","The Aerospace Institute of The Aerospace Corporation is developing an electronic classroom (E-class) concept whereby laptop computers are used for the student-content interface, eliminating the need for hardcopy course notebooks and allowing for a more interactive student learning environment. This interactive method is especially useful for space systems education and instruction involving hands-on tool usage and team projects. The objectives, procedures, design and development, and application experiences for this concept are documented herein. The E-class concept is part of a larger Aerospace Institute plan to make available synchronous and asynchronous learning materials via electronic media. The broader scope of this effort includes the recording and broadcast of live classes, the creation of a course content repository for anytime, anywhere corporate web access, and the E-class concept discussed in this paper. Students benefit by being exposed to hands-on usage of principal system engineering tools and processes in a team-project environment. The integration of this interactive approach within the context of space system engineering instruction provides immediate demonstration and reinforcement of principal concepts, procedures, and tool usage benefits and issues. These benefits are exemplified by application of E-class methods to a Space Systems Concept Development course. There are other factors that play into the corporation's consideration of changing the current instructor lecture via course-book-based instruction, using a single computer/projector system, to a classroom populated by student laptop computers. Besides the interactive advantages mentioned above, the E-class concept permits students to view and annotate course materials on their individual laptops, browse in real time to research resources on-line, and work on single or group exercises. The institute's Training and Development Representatives and instructors also benefit by allowing studen- - ts to take tests and complete evaluation forms on-line. These capabilities provide significant advantages over the current classroom instructional format. There are, of course, trade-offs realized by applying the E-class concept in terms of the workload on the administrative and technical staffs. On the one hand, less time is spent on document creation, editing, and reproduction. The E-class concept, however, requires computer skills, software, and keyboard time in excess of the traditional course delivery method. The E-class concept, as implemented by the Aerospace Corporation, consists of a dedicated server, individual student laptop computers, and power and network connectivity via distributed classroom floor-wired hubs. This hub arrangement allows pod-configuration seating of the students that facilitates a team working-group environment. The concept is mobile between several candidate classrooms. Student computers are set up in preparation for each class and torn down and stored so that classrooms may be scheduled for other purposes, as well","1095-323X;1095323X","POD:0-7803-8870-4","10.1109/AERO.2005.1559755","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1559755","","Aerospace electronics;Aerospace materials;Application software;Broadcasting;Computer aided instruction;Computer interfaces;Computer science education;Disk recording;Portable computers;Systems engineering and theory","aerospace engineering;computer aided instruction;educational courses;teaching","Aerospace Institute;asynchronous learning materials;classroom instructional format;electronic classroom concept;electronic media;hardcopy course notebooks;interactive space systems education;interactive student learning;laptop computers;network connectivity;space system engineering instruction;space systems concept development course;space systems instruction;student-content interface;synchronous learning materials","","1","","4","","","","5-12 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The experience on which the results reported here are based has grown out of progressive testing of different approaches for publishing technical sketches and mathematical notations from the field of electromagnetics on the web, starting in 1997 with simple static web pages of solved examples. The encouraging results from using and evaluating this educational material and the needs expressed by students for learning from more dynamic and interactive web learning materials that offer the possibility of changing parameters in online calculations motivated a search for new approaches to publishing interactive learning materials on the web. Integration of already developed components for building animations, presenting mathematical equations, and performing online computations with browser scripting led to development of a learning environment where animations are synchronized with corresponding derivations of equations and supported by dynamic, parametric-driven calculations and visualizations that can be integrated with sound and video. The system supports tests and examinations in which the answers are provided as mathematical notations. The use of Mathematical Markup Language (MathML) permits equations in the learning materials to be copied and pasted into most of the popular mathematical software tools for algebraic manipulation or numerical computation. Examples demonstrate how the system can be used with a course on electromagnetics, although the basic approach is applicable in other fields of engineering and natural science.","0018-9359;00189359","","10.1109/TE.2005.858396","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532376","Interactive technical sketches;mathematical notations;network traffic modeling;online calculations/visualizations;system access evaluation;web-based education","Animation;Education;Electromagnetic fields;Equations;Learning systems;Publishing;Systems engineering and theory;Testing;Visualization;Web pages","computer aided instruction;computer animation;educational aids;electrical engineering computing;electrical engineering education;electromagnetism;mathematics computing;software tools","algebraic manipulation;building animations;electromagnetic courses;integrated component Web-based interactive learning systems;mathematical markup languages;online calculations","","9","","40","","","","Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The fault removal continues at a slower rate during the operational phase. In this paper, we will investigate some techniques for software reliability prediction and measurement in the operational phase. We first review how some software reliability growth models (SRGMs) based on non-homogeneous Poisson processes (NHPPs) can be readily derived based on a unified theory for NHPP models. Under this general framework, we can not only verify some conventional SRGMs but also derive some new SRGMs that can be used for software reliability measurement in the operational phase. That is, based on the unified theory, we can incorporate the concept of multiple changepoints into software reliability modeling. We can formularize and simulate the fault detection process in the operational phase. Some numerical illustrations based on real software failure data are also presented. The experimental results show that the proposed models can easily reflect the possible changes of fault detection process and offer quantitative analysis on software failure behavior in field operation.","","POD:0-7803-8932-8","10.1109/ITRE.2005.1503132","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1503132","","Computer science;Failure analysis;Fault detection;Information analysis;Phase measurement;Project management;Reliability engineering;Software measurement;Software reliability;Software testing","program testing;software fault tolerance;stochastic processes","multiple changepoints;nonhomogeneous Poisson processes;operational phase;software fault detection process;software reliability growth model;software reliability prediction;software testing;unified theory","","1","","26","","","","27-30 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Full-scale development of this tool was broken up into several components, including background research, user's requirements gathering, prototype design, and testing and revision. The site has been developed using predominantly open-source technologies available to anyone with an Internet connection. Additional deliverables of this project include a detailed user guide containing the specifications and requirements of the system, as well as a section detailing each of the functions within the site.

One of the reasons is that there is a great lack of requirements engineering education in most academic programs, so software developers have to learn requirements engineering practices on the job. This can easily result in the selection of techniques that are ill-suited for a particular project, as the selection is based on personal preference rather than on the characteristics of the project.

Several tools are applied, as the hardware description language for microcomputers systems modeling and FPGA implementations, microcontroller experiments based on proto-o-board assemblies and more complex microprocessor applications based on electronics kits previously developed in the computer engineering program. This methodology applied in this course has been gradually improved through the time, and the improvement process continues, although we believe to have reached a format that integrates theory and practice, where the students have control of the process, involving microprocessors and its applications.","0190-5848;01905848","POD:0-7803-8552-7","10.1109/FIE.2004.1408687","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1408687","","Application software;Assembly systems;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware design languages;Laboratories;Microcomputers;Microcontrollers;Microprocessors;Modeling;Process control","computer science education;educational courses;hardware description languages;laboratory techniques;microcomputers;student experiments","FPGA implementations;computer engineering;computer engineering program;electronic engineering programs;hardware description language;laboratory experimentation;microcomputers systems modeling;microprocessor course;microprocessors;proto-o-board assemblies","","3","","10","","","","20-23 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While courses offered in the electrical and computer engineering disciplines cover such topics as microprocessors, digital and analog hardware, control theory, and programming languages, there exist few courses that focus on integrating these subjects for designing embedded systems. On the other hand, there is a growing need in industry for engineers who can perform software design and system integration for various applications in embedded control. Toward filling this gap, this paper describes a laboratory testbed developed for a new course on Embedded Computer Control offered at the University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.

IV 2004.","20040809","2004","","","308","314","Language theorists argue that the reason why spoken language is acquired so rapidly is that we have an innate predisposition for understanding linguistic structures. Theories of perception also hold that there may be deeply seated mechanisms for decomposing visual objects and analyzing them into both component parts and the structural interrelationships of those parts. We propose the theory that diagrams that activate the mechanisms for structural object perception should be similarly easy to learn. This builds on previous work in which we have developed diagramming principles based on the theory of structural object perception. We call these geon diagrams. We have previously shown that such diagrams are easy to remember and to analyze. To evaluate our hypothesis that geon diagrams should also be easy to understand we carried out an empirical study to evaluate the learnability of geon diagram semantics in comparison with the well-established UML convention. The results support our theory of learnability. Both ""novices"" and ""experts"" found the geon diagram syntax easier to apply in a diagram-to-textual description matching task than the equivalent UML syntax.","1093-9547;10939547","POD:0-7695-2177-0","10.1109/IV.2004.1320162","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1320162","","Computer science;Data visualization;LAN interconnection;Natural languages;Object recognition;Pediatrics;Programming profession;Software engineering;Software systems;Unified modeling language","computer science education;diagrams;object recognition;program visualisation;specification languages;visual perception","UML diagrams;diagram-to-textual description matching task;diagramming principles;geon diagrams;geon theory;learnability theory;object recognition;perceptual syntax;semantic learning;software engineering visualization;structural interrelationship;structural object perception;visual object decomposition","","2","","16","","","","14-16 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At Georgia Tech, we offer three courses that cover protective relaying: an undergraduate course that devotes one-third of the semester on relaying, a graduate course entitled ""Power System Protection,"" and a three-and-a-half-day short course for practicing engineers. To maximize student understanding and training on the concepts, theory, and technology associated with protective relaying, we have developed a number of educational tools, all wrapped in a virtual environment. The virtual environment includes a) a power system simulator, b) a simulator of instrumentation for protective relaying with visualization and animation modules, c) specific protective relay models with visualization and animation modules, and d) interfaces to hardware so that testing of actual relaying equipment can be performed.

Qualitative representation of occlusion relation has been investigated in qualitative spatial reasoning. This research is important for computer vision and robot navigation. The previous models such as LOS and ROC-20 are all based on RCC (the famous topological theory). But those models couldn't support abstract objects such as point and line which are very common in real applications. To deal with this, multi-dimensional spatial occlusion relation (MSO) is put forward. The foundation of MSO is MRCC which is the multi-dimensional extension of RCC. So MSO is suitable for both real and abstract objects. The conception neighborhood and composition of MSO is given. Finally MSO is extended to spatio-temporal relation by adding time feature. MSO is an appropriate frame to express spatio-temporal knowledge.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259766","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259766","","Application software;Computer science;Computer science education;Computer vision;Educational institutions;Knowledge engineering;Laboratories;Navigation;Robot vision systems;Topology","common-sense reasoning;knowledge representation;navigation;robot vision;spatial reasoning;temporal reasoning;topology","abstract objects;computer vision;multidimensional spatial occlusion relation;qualitative spatial reasoning;region connection calculus;robot navigation;spatiotemporal knowledge;spatiotemporal representation;time feature;topological relation;topological theory","","0","","8","","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

End-user programmers are writing an unprecedented number of programs, due in large part to the significant effort put forth to bring programming power to end users. Unfortunately, this effort has not been supplemented by a comparable effort to help them increase the correctness of these often-faulty programs. One of the most widely used real-world end-user programming paradigms is the spreadsheet. Despite its perceived simplicity, evidence from this paradigm reveals that end-user programs often contain an alarming number of faults. To address this problem we plan to work towards providing the end user with just enough fine grained information they need to help them create correct and reliable spreadsheets. One means to facilitate such help is to develop an on-demand explanatory and advisory system that would encourage exploratory learning by the user and thus effective use of the system's features. The focus of this research is to bring the principles of educational theory to end user programming to help end users build their skills that enhance their information seeking power and thus succeed in creating correct spreadsheets. We think this research would also benefit the educationally disadvantaged populations equally because the disadvantages (one specific disadvantage being lack of programming experience/background) faced by both these groups seem to overlap.","","POD:0-7803-8225-0","10.1109/HCC.2003.1260250","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260250","","Application software;Debugging;Explosives;Face detection;Investments;Programming profession;Software engineering;Software prototyping;Software tools;State estimation","computer science education;programming","educational theory;end-user programming;exploratory learning;on-demand advisory system;on-demand explanatory system","","0","","13","","","","28-31 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings.","20031027","2003","","","80","91","Physics-based animation programs can often be modeled in terms of hybrid automata. A hybrid automaton includes both discrete and continuous dynamical variables. The discrete variables define the automaton's modes of behavior. The continuous variables are governed by mode-dependent differential equations. This paper describes a system for specifying and automatically synthesizing physics-based animation programs based on hybrid automata. The system presents a program developer with a family of parameterized specification schemata. Each scheme describes a pattern of behavior as a hybrid automaton passes through a sequence of modes. The developer specifies a program by selecting one or more schemata and supplying application-specific instantiation parameters for each of them. Each scheme is associated with a set of axioms in logic of hybrid automata. The axioms serve to document the semantics of the specification scheme. Each scheme is also associated with a set of implementation rules. The rules synthesize program components implementing the specification in general physics-based animation architecture. The system allows animation programs to be developed and tested in an incremental manner. The system itself can be extended to incorporate additional schemata for specifying new patterns o behavior, along with new sets of axioms and implementation rules. It has been implemented and tested on over a dozen examples. We believe this research is a significant step toward a specification and synthesis system that is flexible enough to handle a wide variety of animation programs, yet restricted enough to permit programs to be synthesized automatically.","1938-4300;19384300","POD:0-7695-2035-9","10.1109/ASE.2003.1240297","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1240297","","Animation;Automata;Automotive engineering;Computer science;Differential equations;Educational institutions;Educational programs;Layout;Logic;Physics education","automata theory;computer animation;formal specification;physics computing","application-specific instantiation parameters;continuous variables;discrete variables;hybrid automata;incremental testing;mode-dependent differential equations;parameterized specification schemata;physics-based animation;specification system;synthesis system","","0","","23","","","","6-10 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Inadvertent errors may creep in due to programmers not being aware of the security implications of their code. Writing secure code is largely a software engineering issue requiring the education of programmers about safe coding practices. Various projects and efforts such as memory usage profiling, meta-compilation and typing proofs that verify correctness of the code at compile-time and run-time provide additional assistance in this regard. We point out that in the context of security, one aspect that is perhaps underrated or overlooked is that vulnerabilities may be inherent in the syntax and grammar of a programming language itself. We leverage on some well-studied problems to show that small syntactic discrepancies may lead to vast semantic differences in programs and in turn, correlate to hard security errors. This technique will helps caution programmers on the types of errors to avoid as well as serve as a guideline for language designers to lay emphasis not only on richness of language features but also the unambiguity of the syntax.","","POD:0-7803-7808-3","10.1109/SMCSIA.2003.1232415","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232415","","Computer errors;Computer languages;Computer science;Computer security;Creep;Data security;Java;Programming profession;Runtime;Writing","error handling;grammars;program control structures;program debugging;program verification;programming;programming language semantics;programming theory;security of data","ambiguous syntactic constructs;grammars;insecure programming;programming language security;secure software engineering;software vulnerability;syntax error","","1","","23","","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This class should be taught in such a way that students get interested in learning real programming with the object-oriented approach. Students also know the basics of data structures and applications of data structures. If this class is not taught properly, students will drop out. This course is the main foundation for a programmer or computer scientist. This paper describes the experience of the author in designing and teaching an object-oriented design and data structures course at Arizona State University, USA for the last eight semesters. This paper also describes the goal of the course, which is to provide an in-depth understanding of the object oriented design and fundamental data structures and motivate students to become a programmer.","","POD:0-7695-1916-4","10.1109/ITCC.2003.1197498","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1197498","","Application software;Computer science;Data engineering;Data structures;Design engineering;Education;Information systems;Object oriented programming;Programming profession;Systems engineering and theory","computer science education;data structures;object-oriented programming;teaching","Arizona State University;computer information systems;computer system engineering;data structure course;object-oriented design;programming;teaching","","0","","","","","","28-30 April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose hardware/software architecture for a web-based distance laboratory for programmable logic controllers (PLCs). This Web-based PLC Lab allows the laboratory facilities shared among several academic institutes and can be accessed by registered students to practice PLC experiments at their own home, enhancing the quality of education without much increasing in the overall cost.

Neural networks can be trained to learn the behavior of passive/active components/circuits. A trained neural network can be used for high-level design, providing fast and accurate answers to the task it has learned. Neural networks are attractive alternatives to conventional methods such as numerical modeling methods, which could be computationally expensive, or analytical methods which could be difficult to obtain for new devices, or empirical modeling solutions whose range and accuracy may be limited. This tutorial describes fundamental concepts in this emerging area aimed at teaching RF/microwave engineers what neural networks are, why they are useful, when they can be used, and how to use them. Neural-network structures and their training methods are described from the RF/microwave designer's perspective. Electromagnetics-based training for passive component models and physics-based training for active device models are illustrated. Circuit design and yield optimization using passive/active neural models are also presented. A multimedia slide presentation along with narrative audio clips is included in the electronic version of this paper.

Namely, lectures allow only passive learning, and projects are so constrained by the time and scope requirements of the academic environment that they cannot be large enough to exhibit many of the phenomena occurring in realworld software engineering processes. To address this problem, we have developed Problems and Programmers, an educational card game that simulates the software engineering process and is designed to teach those process issues that are not sufficiently highlighted by lectures and projects.

It is crucial to make this fact, and its implications, concrete to students who aspire to be or work with software engineers. Although frequent collaborations are encouraged throughout degree programmes, final-year group projects remain the favoured mechanism for achieving this goal. This paper describes and reflects on our experience of introducing group projects to balance theory, technology and practice into five different degree programmes. A novel facet of our approach has been to locate these projects in the context of a course on software project management in parallel with the preparation of capstone, individual projects. Hence, the final-year group projects are viewed as essential complements to the individual projects and together they encapsulate the theories and systematic practices of software projects we know as software engineering. We argue that this approach injects realism into what might have been seen by students as abstract primarily by providing students with experience of working as part of a team and so enabling them to engage with large and significant projects.","1093-0175;10930175","POD:0-7695-1869-9","10.1109/CSEE.2003.1191377","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1191377","","Collaborative work;Computer science;Computer science education;Concrete;Educational programs;Information systems;Project management;Software engineering;Software systems;Visualization","computer science education;educational courses;project management;software engineering","curriculum;degree programmes;final-year group projects;software engineering;software project management courses","","3","","6","","","","20-22 March 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To stimulate the student's interests of AI research and introduce the RoboCup games to more students, we transplant the RoboCup to an educational platform for students to study and research. This paper shows the structure and design of the whole platform, the specific implementation of basic modules on the educational platform. The platform is divided into three parts: low-level module, libraries, and program scheme. Students should work in the programming scheme part, build the basic skill and top-level strategy layer. This paper describes the main theory of the basic skills such as dribble, kick, and shoot, including the distributed planning in realizing these skills. The top-level strategy part analyzes the realization of several basic strategies and machine learning's impact on the game. We also provide the method and framework for implementing the basic skills and top-level strategy, called the qsinghuAeolus program.

Experience in teaching has shown that a complementary approach combining theoretical and practical exercises is vital for effective learning. Increasingly, teaching institutions are offering remote access to distant laboratories as part of an overall e-learning strategy. Remote experimentation provided as part of a Web-based learning approach affords a number of critical benefits, allowing flexible access to on-campus resources free of time or geographical constraints. In the context of distance learning it can be the only realistic method of performing experiments. However adapting and redeveloping existing software and hardware resources to this purpose is both time consuming and expensive. An innovative simple approach to this problem is presented in this paper. The remote desktop method offered here allows students to have full access to existing on-campus laboratory resources remotely but without substantial implementation and development overheads incurred by the providers. This is achieved through increased functionality and extended utilisation of existing assets.","1062-922X;1062922X","POD:0-7803-7437-1","10.1109/ICSMC.2002.1175578","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175578","","Computer aided instruction;Embedded system;Intelligent systems;Internet;Laboratories;Modeling;Real time systems;Systems engineering and theory;Systems engineering education;Test equipment","Internet;computer aided instruction;distance learning;embedded systems;engineering education;student experiments","Internet-based methodology;Web-based learning approach;distant laboratories;e-learning strategy;engineering education;laboratory experiments;remote access;remote desktop method;remotely accessed embedded systems;teaching","","14","","22","","","","6-9 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The mathematical model is analyzed using a software package such as Mathcad<sup>®</sup>, TKSolver<sup>®</sup> or Matlab<sup>®</sup>. Once the mathematical model has been evaluated, students are asked to interpret and verify their results by working with the actual linkage. Using a hands-on project to teach dynamics allows students to build associations between analytical calculations, and what is being observed during the operation of the device. A LEGO<sup>®</sup> mechanism further develops an understanding of why assumptions are made, and when they are valid.

"A new graduate program in networked information systems engineering: underlying thinkings","S. Ghosh","","32nd Annual Frontiers in Education","20030114","2002","3","","S3A","","Summary form only given. There is a strong feeling among many educators and particularly within the government, military, and industry that, to address the networked information technology systems of the future, the computer engineering (CpE) and computer engineering and science (CE&S) training should be augmented with the fundamental principles of: (a) integrated hardware-software systems, (b) computer architecture, (c) networking, (d) network security, (e) modeling and simulation, (f) computational intelligence, (g) asynchronous distributed algorithms, and (h) creative design. The enhanced CpE or CE&S program will take on a new existence-networked information systems engineering (NISE), in its own right. Given that the combined knowledge of the sub-fields (a) through (h) is likely to be overwhelming for any time-bound graduate program, a practical NISE curriculum must consist of an integrated distillate of all the sub-fields. In addition, the NISE program must include elements of physical and mathematical intuition and key principles from mechanics, thermodynamics, and fluid mechanics, all of which are critically necessary to foster technical leadership among the future NISE engineers and are visibly lacking in many of today's CpE or CE&S graduates.","0190-5848;01905848","POD:0-7803-7444-4","10.1109/FIE.2002.1158683","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1158683","","Computer industry;Computer networks;Defense industry;Design engineering;Distributed computing;Government;Industrial training;Information systems;Military computing;Systems engineering and theory","computer science education;educational courses;information systems;internetworking","asynchronous distributed algorithms;computational intelligence;computer architecture;computer engineering and science program;computer engineering program;creative design;curriculum;fluid mechanics;graduate program;integrated hardware-software systems;mathematical intuition;mechanics;modeling;network security;networked information systems engineering;networking;physical intuition;simulation;technical leadership;thermodynamics;training","","0","","","","","","6-9 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Computing curricula in Australia have tended to emphasize the scientific and computer engineering side, the hardware side, of computing but the advent of the PSE demands new approaches to curricular design involving new topics and a product-based, rather than theory-based, emphasis. Since the graduate PSE will tend to be industrially oriented, a large practical content will be desirable in the course. This, in turn, will nor only raise educational issues within academia but also challenge long-held industrial attitudes towards universities, their students and graduates.

Therefore, the tool can be accessed via the World Wide Web and/or by a CD-ROM in stand-alone PCs by students and professionals. Since the Java-programs are simple to handle, a student can immediately start working with the programs and can fully concentrate on the theory of the problem instead of studying help-manuals. Because of the underlying software technology, the tool can be used for online learning and can be easily integrated into an e-learning platform for distance learning. It can be also used in the traditional classroom with laptop and beamer, via Internet or CD-ROM.

Engineers must apply protective relay systems for the most probable events based on practical judgment to minimize service interruptions and damage to the equipment. Understanding the performance and limitations of different protective relay systems is vital in their application. One can explain the philosophy of system protection, the basic theory of a protective relay system, and the relay algorithms from classroom sessions and/or computer simulation. However, it is difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate the actual performance and possible misoperation of a relay in the field just through computer simulation or benchtop testing.

Accumulated coding wisdom of more than four decades, now being codified in the SWEBOK, should smooth the process of learning to develop software if presented early in the student's career. Typically, however, it continues to be presented in advanced programming units rather than as fundamental understanding. As a consequence, code hacking is the norm in undergraduate years. This paper examines current practice and presents the view that what is needed is not a return to basics but rather an advance to basics - that syntax and semantics should be seen as a means of expression of formulated ideas and that student software engineers should be exposed immediately to the notion of code construction as the application of basic concepts rather than fluency in a language - thereby potentially bringing together programming practice and software engineering theory","1093-0175;10930175","POD:0-7695-1515-0","10.1109/CSEE.2002.995214","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=995214","","Application software;Computer crime;Computer industry;Construction industry;Debugging;Engineering profession;Knowledge engineering;Programming profession;Software engineering;Software maintenance","computer science education;educational courses;programming;software engineering;teaching","SWEBOK;code construction;education;programming;semantics;software engineering;syntax;teaching;undergraduate course","","0","","18","","","","2002","25 Feb 2002-27 Feb 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper uses the analysis of the requirements for initial professional education for software engineers put forward by Ford and Gibbs (1996) and describes some clear relationships between the teaching and learning requirements for the two subjects. Evidence is provided to show that the context, in terms of the indicators of professional maturity of the two disciplines is comparable. It is also shown that the skills needed are very similar and there are common knowledge areas (a fact already noted in the SWEBOK Stoneman draft). It is, therefore, suggested that aspects of the teaching approach used in the successful systems engineering course may be applicable for the initial professional education of software engineers. The paper explains the requirements and constraints for the systems engineering course and outlines the educational philosophy adopted, indicating how prior software engineering experience (practice and teaching) was used to guide the approach taken. Relevant experiences gained from running the course are summarised and some of the lessons that have been learned are evaluated for their potential application to software engineering","1093-0175;10930175","POD:0-7695-1059-0","10.1109/CSEE.2001.913840","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=913840","","Computer science;Computer science education;Educational programs;Electronic mail;Forward contracts;Knowledge engineering;Software engineering;Software systems;Systems engineering and theory;Systems engineering education","computer science education;educational courses;professional aspects;software engineering;systems engineering;teaching","SWEBOK project;case study;computer science education;defence contractor;educational course;educational philosophy;professional education;software engineering education;systems engineering education;teaching","","1","","4","","","","2001","19 Feb 2001-21 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper discusses an interactive learning approach built around an educational computer system called LAND. Environmental and land use modellers have made considerable steps forward in the development of theory and the incorporation of this theory into computer models. Also, recent developments in computer software provide considerable potential for creating a user friendly, interactive, dynamic, easy to learn, and visually stimulating computer environment which can assist students in interacting with computer models.

To support this understanding, we propose a mechanism called an “action history view” which shows the past actions of a user to other users for the purpose of letting them know what he/she has done, without revealing secret or useless information. The mechanism is coordinated among users who are distributed in terms of time. In this paper, the concept of the action history view mechanism is applied to hypermedia systems based on an object-oriented model to support users in viewing or reviewing past presentations in a short amount of time in hiding specified actions which it is not appropriate to show to other users. The generation of views is executed by removing a series of actions that correspond with the component to be hidden. The system also has a function for supporting users to select actions interactively while the user is viewing the replay. To qualify those kinds of views, the actions performed in a presentation are recorded in an action history stream, which consists of multiple logs. Finally, the application and implementation of a prototype of the action history view mechanism to a distance education system based on hypermedia is described","0730-3157;07303157","POD:0-8186-8585-9","10.1109/CMPSAC.1998.716689","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=716689","","Computer networks;Electrical capacitance tomography;History;Indium tin oxide;Informatics;National electric code;Power engineering and energy;Privacy;Security;Systems engineering and theory","educational technology;groupware;hypermedia;object-oriented programming;user interfaces;utility programs","action hiding;action history stream;action history view mechanisms;computer-supported cooperative work;distance education system;hypermedia systems;interactive action selection;multiple logs;object-oriented model;past presentations;replay;secret information;user activities;user's past actions","","2","","7","","","","19-21 Aug 1998","19 Aug 1998-21 Aug 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional methods for teaching electromagnetic (EM) field theory were not appropriate for the target audience. The typical student in the technology program does not have a strong background in vector calculus; the primary tool used to teach electromagnetic field theory. As a result, alternative methods had to be found that would convey the same information without the dependence on mathematical models for insight. Omitting the vector based mathematical models would be a mistake because most texts and articles on RF design assume knowledge of Maxwell's equations. The solution was to provide the students with visual based computer software that would allow the student to manipulate a graphical representation of the mathematical model in conjunction with teaching the mathematical models. Omatrix by Harmonic Software was chosen as the programming language because it was (1) relatively inexpensive, (2) had good graphing tools, and (3) used a simple BASIC like structure that was easy to teach and easy for the students to learn.

Some students may also have had the opportunity to learn basic software design concepts, such as the benefits of top-down design and the practice and virtues of programming in a modular fashion using a structured programming approach. However, fewer students have been exposed to the theory and practice of object-oriented software development. Understanding object-oriented programming concepts requires that the student undergo a paradigm shift. The student must move from thinking about modeling systems and problems in terms of the actions that must be performed to thinking about the objects that must interact with each other to perform those actions. Successfully navigating this change in thought is not a trivial undertaking, but the rewards of doing so can be tremendous.

First, films clarify the relationship between field intensity and flux density, by providing distinct mathematical and graphical representations for the two types of fields. Second, Ampere's and Faraday's laws obtain graphical representations that are as intuitive as the representation of Gauss's law. Third, the vector Stokes theorem and the divergence theorem become special cases of a single relationship that is easier for the student to remember, apply, and visualize than their vector formulations. Fourth, computational simplifications result from the use of forms: derivatives are easier to employ in curvilinear coordinates, integration becomes more straightforward, and families of vector identities are replaced by algebraic rules. In this paper, EM theory and the calculus of differential forms are developed in parallel, from an elementary, conceptually oriented point of view using simple examples and intuitive motivations. We conclude that because of the power of the calculus of differential forms in conveying the fundamental concepts of EM theory, it provides an attractive and viable alternative to the use of vector analysis in teaching electromagnetic field theory","0018-9359;00189359","","10.1109/13.554670","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=554670","","Application software;Calculus;Concrete;Education;Electromagnetic analysis;Electromagnetic field theory;Gaussian processes;Physics;Tensile stress;Visualization","algebra;calculus;differential equations;electrical engineering education;electromagnetic field theory;magnetic fields;magnetic flux","Ampere's law;EM theory;Faraday's law;algebraic rules;calculus;computational simplifications;curvilinear coordinates;differential forms;divergence theorem;electromagnetic field theory teaching;electrostatics;field intensity;flux density;graphical representations;intuitive motivations;magnetostatics;mathematical representations;vector Stokes theorem","","26","1","21","","","","Feb 1997","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

There has long been debate about whether academic training at the university level should be oriented toward the fundamental theories of software engineering and computer science or toward a more practical curriculum of immediate relevance to those job markets. By and large, the theoretical side seems to be dominant in the US (and in Europe). US academic institutions tend to lack courses in several topics required for professional software production. As a result, recent college graduates in any technical domain usually require mentoring and on-the-job training before they can be entrusted with significant assignments. Large corporations normally supplement gaps in academic training with extensive entry-level training for new software employees. But as employment in these companies declines, smaller companies hire a larger percentage of new graduates. Small companies seldom and usually cannot afford to offer entry-level training.

In rp8601, the analogue and digital interactions with the environment have been designed into the chips and into the language, and so have mechanisms to handle time constraints. Traditionally, declarative programming means that the programmer need not be aware of the processor operations. Instead, he can focus on the abstract relations between the input and output streams. The specific real-time requirements have normally not been taken into account in the declarative view.

Such organisation is recursively defined so that it refers to the operations of life at every scale, microscopic organisms, vital organs, animals, social groups of animals including commercial firms, interdependent species, and the entire biosphere. It follows that the natural structure and behaviour of sets of symbols used to represent information are characterised by the interplay of recursively defined order and intrinsic disorder arising from physical uncertainty in the behaviour of very small objects in the control mechanisms of life. Recognition and acceptance of such features of the nature of information offers useful guidance to information system designers in their selection of strategic objectives, e.g. to reduce the hazards of program development by minimising the gross multiplicity of details that must be correct for a program to operate as intended.<<ETX>>","0963-7346;09637346","","10.1049/esej:19930052","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=233303","","Information systems;Information theory;Software engineering","information systems;information theory;software engineering","information system;information theory;intrinsic disorder;organisation;physical uncertainty;program development;recursively defined order;symbols","","0","","","","","","Aug. 1993","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

The Laplace complex variable, or the Heaviside derivative operator, is used with Cramer's rule from elementary mathematics to allow students to expeditiously gain a foothold on linear dynamic systems theory. The approach applies to the broad class of finite-dimensional linear time invariant systems as they can be readily expressed as a square system of equations in the form <e1>Ax</e1>=<e1>Bu </e1>. The elements of the system's <e1>A</e1> and <e1>B</e1> matrices are, in general, polynomials in the Laplace complex variable or the Heaviside derivative operator. Cramer's rule permits an explicit solution for this square nonhomogeneous system for a desired unknown, or output, with respect to an input of interest. Consequently, Cramer's rule gives rise to a general method with pedagogical appeal for obtaining desired system transfer functions.

Although it is a conceptually simple abstraction, concurrent programming is challenging because processes interact with themselves in several obscure ways.

Easy equation sets have one unknown variable in each equation such that the equations can be solved sequentially. Hard equation sets have one critical unknown located in many (or all) of the equations in the set such that many (or all) of the equations must be solved simultaneously. We call these equations ""coupled"" and we teach students how they can analyze equation sets (based on the location of known and unknown variables) to ""decouple"" the equations and make the solution path easy. We describe the algorithm called the DeCoupler, which is used to identify variable interactions to determine the optimal decoupling variables. We also describe the SmartSwapper algorithm, which uses information from the DeCoupler to simplify the solution path and parametrically iterate to a solution. The algorithms are logic based rather than numerically focused. The algorithms have been implemented into an equation solving software program (SmartSolve2) to demonstrate their effectiveness compared to other commercial strategies. It has been shown that these algorithms can solve nonlinear simultaneous equations without the need for highly refined initial guesses.

The objective of this grant was to develop a series of computational exercises in antenna analysis and design which could be used in conjunction with the senior level electromagnetics technical elective as well as with a graduate level course in antenna theory and design. These exercises have been successfully developed and are being used with both these courses. They are assigned to the students at appropriate times during the semester when the theory underlying the topic of a particular computational exercise is being discussed in class. This gives the student an immediate opportunity to compare theory with the results of numerical modeling. The exercises utilize existing antenna analysis and design software for personal computers to which students have easy access either at home or at the university.

Coll., Japan","IEEE Transactions on Education","20020806","1998","41","4","16 pp.","","The necessity of in-depth learning of cogging/detent torque for mainly undergraduates is discussed with particular attention to its method and tools. The experimental tools developed include a cogging-torque tester, variable-skew rotors for a DC motor and a three-phase hybrid stepping motor having a special rotor construction to eliminate certain harmonic components of cogging torque. Two pieces of software are presented for use in the class and laboratory to supplement the experiment set-ups: one is a motion simulator for a watch stepping motor to demonstrate the notion of detent torque; and the other is for quick computation of the cogging torque primarily to investigate pole-and-slot number combinations for various pole-arc to pole-pitch ratios. The latter can be used to see the effects of construction asymmetry on the cogging-torque's amplitude and frequency. The usage of these tools and software is discussed from the viewpoint of engineering education. The major conclusion is that the variable skew rotor is very suited to in-depth learning of cogging torque but the supplemental use of the computation software is invaluable for gaining deeper insight into this subject.","0018-9359;00189359","","10.1109/13.728285","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=728285","","Computational modeling;DC motors;Forging;Frequency;Laboratories;Rotors;Software tools;Testing;Torque;Watches","computer aided instruction;electric machine analysis computing;electric motors;machine theory;power engineering education;rotors;teaching;torque","CAI;cogging-torque tester;cogging/detenting torque;computation software;computer simulation;engineering education;harmonic components elimination;in-depth learning;pole-and-slot number combinations;pole-arc to pole-pitch ratio;rotor construction;three-phase hybrid stepping motor;undergraduates;variable-skew rotor DC motors","","0","","","","","","Nov. 1998","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

When test cases are allocated in proportion to the size of subdomains, partition testing strategies are provably better than random testing, in the sense of having a higher or equal probability of detecting at least one failure (the P-measure). Recently, the Generalised Proportional Sampling (GPS) strategy, which is always satisfiable, was proposed to relax the proportionality condition. The paper studies the use of approximation methods to generate test distributions satisfying the GPS strategy, and evaluates this proposal empirically. Our results are very encouraging, showing that on average about 98.72% to almost 100% of the test distributions obtained in this way are better than random testing in terms of the P-measure","","POD:0-7695-0509-0","10.1109/APSEC.1999.809655","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=809655","","Approximation methods;Computer science;Computer science education;Fault detection;Global Positioning System;Mathematics;Performance evaluation;Sampling methods;Software engineering;Software testing","probability;program testing;programming theory","GPS strategy;Generalised Proportional Sampling;P-measure;approximation methods;generalised proportional sampling strategy;partition testing strategies;proportionality condition;random testing;satisfiable;software testing;test distributions;unfavourable circumstances","","0","","12","","","","1999","07 Dec 1999-10 Dec 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is frequently not the top-scoring similarities that bring important new information to the investigating scientist, but the content of the annotation or similarity ""hits"" at any significant score. The Gene Alert algorithm applies additional filtering and a user weighted keyword search to the BLAST output to parse the output into a form customized to the user. There are three components to the Gene Alert implementation as it is currently operating: an organized file structure, a BLAST engine, and a parser written in the PERL scripting language.

A mini-project in this context is a rather simple digital circuit which is utilized as a vehicle to transfer methods and knowledge to the students. Each mini-project has a practical application which can be understood easily and is implemented as an experiment on a special educational circuit board, GALEX, with an in-system programmable logic device, ispGAL22V10. The tool for design, synthesis and simulation is the evaluation version of the design environment, LOG/iC2. All lectures are held preferably in the laboratory with one PC and one GALEX board for each student. After presentation of the relevant theory in the lecture, each student has to design his own circuit for the lecture related mini-project. Hardware implementation is verified by external measurement. It is obvious that the systematic approach requires a design for testability from the very beginning. As a consequence, validation of all results is necessary and possible. Test vectors stored in a file must be used or even enhanced at every step of the design process. Students learn how to use all necessary hardware and software tools during the first mini-project in the very first lecture.

We discuss how Sound Blaster 16 cards, and their later generation successors, can be used to create a simple and inexpensive (audio frequency) network- or spectrum-analyzer. By use of existing shareware software, students may use the sound card to excite an external circuit with an audio tone, and simultaneously record the response of the circuit. In past work we have used various audio tones to excite the circuit, including linear- and exponentially-(frequency)-chirped tones, and white noise. By coupling the sound card inputs and outputs to an external breadboard containing simple circuits (such as RC low-pass and high-pass filters), we demonstrated the ability to excite these circuits, and through post-processing of the recorded data, extract both the magnitude and phase of the transfer function for the circuit under test. In this paper we focus on methods in which audio files can be passed among different applications. In particular, we illustrate the ability to import and export audio data from and into MatLab and Cool Edit, using Cool Edit's superior sound recording/playback capabilities in conjunction with MatLab's powerful signal and array-processing capabilities.

The general educational goal is to ""enable its graduates to anticipate and to respond effectively to the uncertainties of a changing technological...world"". It uses the ""Engineer Thought Process"" to help meet this general goal. Each student enrolled in the Academy selects a five-course engineering sequence. Students become familiar with analytical and empirical models representing components, systems or processes that are germane to the selected sequence. The final phase of the sequence is a capstone project in which the students must design and implement or prototype a solution to a real world technical problem. In order to comply with the standard Academy curricular model, we are moving to one computer science engineering sequence for not only CS majors, but also for our nonmajors taking the CS engineering sequence courses. The computer science capstone project requires students to build an extensive software system. This requires a breadth of knowledge in software design principles as well as sufficient depth in a particular programming language and environment. In this sense, students must be well trained in the use of the selected language. Yet, to serve its purpose as a viable system, students must also take into consideration the software engineering aspects of system development.

The cadets who will use the CASE tool are seniors completing a capstone design project with a local client. They have become system designers who must build an Information System to meet the needs of their client. The cadets only have 2 semesters to learn how to use a CASE tool and apply it to their system design using the six phases of the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC). The current CASE tool available to them is very robust and non user-friendly. As a result, little value is currently gained from the use of this CASE tool. That is why it is vital that a new user friendly CASE tool is acquired.

The aim of the approach is to expose the student to the essential skills of projecting physical system characteristics into the framework of a useful model and the reverse process of translating model simulation results into the physical framework. Each student is individually responsible for accomplishing construction, modeling and controller design. The system hardware costs are minimal as a result of employing surplus components and a novel potentiometer position sensor design. Consequently, the students are entitled to keep their personal positioning systems upon demonstration of successfully satisfying design requirements. A motivation for the development of the student personal positioning system hardware approach is to complement the advent of powerful and user friendly modeling and simulation software packages which make it possible for even the beginning student to completely design a control system in a virtual environment. The personal positioning system provides the critical link between virtual environment and reality. In addition, these software packages make it all the more unlikely that students will encounter actual control systems in more advanced courses and consequently a greater demand is placed on introductory courses to provide a lasting exposure to the skill of relating the physical system to the simulation model","0190-5848;01905848","POD:0-7803-4086-8","10.1109/FIE.1997.635890","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=635890","","Control system synthesis;Control systems;Costs;Hardware;Modeling;Potentiometers;Sensor systems;Software packages;Systems engineering and theory;Virtual environment","control engineering education;control system analysis computing;control system synthesis;educational courses;position control;project engineering","computer simulation;control engineering education course;control systems analysis;control systems design;control systems fabrication;introductory courses;simulation software packages;student personal positioning system","","0","","6","","","","5-8 Nov 1997","05 Nov 1997-08 Nov 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

IEEE Conference and Workshop on","20020806","1999","","","336","343","Many modern systems are controlled by Computer-Based Systems (CBS). Examples include commercial management information systems such as airline reservations, payroll information, stock central, and electronic banking systems, real-time embedded computer systems such as process control and computer integrated manufacturing systems, space systems, telephone and communications systems, transportation systems (automotive control, train control, ship control, traffic control), medical instruments, avionics systems, missile control systems, microcomputer controlled domestic appliances and point of sale systems. The CBS controlling these systems, typically consist of many networked geographically distributed subsystems. Each subsystem may be or may contain a multi-computer system. They are intensively dependent on software, and frequently depend on data communication networks, human-computer interaction, and special hardware. Engineers developing such systems have to work with CBS engineers responsible for the development of the supporting CBS. To be able to work with them they have to have a basic knowledge in the Engineering of CBS (ECBS). The paper describes the ECBS tasks to be undertaken by systems engineers during the development of systems they build, the CBS subjects they should understand and comprehend and the structure of the courses they should take to augment their knowledge.

Teaching and Learning in an Era of Change","20020806","1997","2","","796 vol.2","","Summary form only given. Graduating engineers must be prepared for the quickly changing technical environment they will be entering. Students need an experiential learning environment that provides them with a more intuitive approach to engineering problems, which in turn encourages them to study theory. It is also possible with such an approach to encourage and teach team interaction, which is important in today's industry. This paper focuses on lessons learned helping students learn to take control of their learning environment. Teaching a class interactively can be a challenge; students like familiar things. Interactive learning changes the rules about education students have become accustomed to. This can be a very uncomfortable experience, however once the students understand what is happening, learning the material often becomes fun.","0190-5848;01905848","POD:0-7803-4086-8","10.1109/FIE.1997.635963","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=635963","","Computer aided software engineering;Education;Electromagnetics;Finishing","educational courses;electrical engineering education;teaching","case study;class teaching;electromagnetics education;experiential learning environment;interactive learning;students;team interaction","","1","","","","","","5-8 Nov. 1997","05 Nov 1997-08 Nov 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At Texas Tech University, C S 3461 (Concepts of Programming Languages) is a study of programming language theory and design, with Ada 95 as the primary language used. This course is also part of an eight-course software engineering-related sequence in the Texas Tech undergraduate curriculum. A class in programming language theory and design is of course not primarily concerned with software engineering; however, as the need for languages which support the software engineering methodology has increased, therefore, there has become a need to discuss related issues in the programming languages course, such as object-oriented design, program validation, and proofs of correctness. In addition, as the software engineering content of the introductory programming sequence (which is a prerequisite to this course) has increased, the degree of design and testing required for the programming assignments in this course has also occurred. In 1995, the Department of Computer Science received a grant from the Defense Information Systems Agency' to revise this course so that it primarily revolved around Ada 95 as the language by which design issues are discussed. Besides the class lectures, this four-semester hour course contains a laboratory component which covers Ada 95, Smalltalk, and Prolog. The students learn the languages through the use of laboratory tutorials, and are required to implement programming languages using this knowledge. In this manner, a mixture of theory and practice is provided to the student.","0190-5848;01905848","POD:0-7803-4086-8","10.1109/FIE.1997.635900","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=635900","","Computer languages;Computer science;Information systems;Knowledge engineering;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Logic programming;Object oriented programming;Software engineering;Software testing","Ada;computer science education;educational courses;programming;software engineering","Ada 95;Prolog;Smalltalk;Texas Tech University;correctness proofs;four-semester hour course;introductory programming sequence;laboratory component;laboratory tutorials;object-oriented design;program validation;programming language design;programming language theory;programming languages course;software engineering-oriented concepts;software engineering-related sequence;undergraduate curriculum","","0","","","","","","5-8 Nov. 1997","05 Nov 1997-08 Nov 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Today's classroom and technologies offer solutions to the challenges that face students and instructors in circuits. Software tools now support several areas of the curriculum (e.g. circuits and electromagnetic fields), and many students learn to use them early in their studies. The availability of powerful personal computers linked to classroom video projection systems creates an opportunity for faculty to broaden the scope of their instruction on-the-fly, with a high level of audience interaction and exploration. With software tools, examples can be explored freely, and students can address ""what-if"" questions immediately. Students gain valuable reinforcement for their understanding of abstract concepts by seeing physical, practical effects on the screen, under their control.

In the programme principles of architectural composition, based upon the ordering and organisation of typological architectural elements according to established rules of composition are introduced to the students through the study of recognised works of design theory. CAD and desktop virtual reality are then used to define and manipulate architectural elements, and to make formal and spatial evaluations of the environments created. The paper describes the theoretical context of the work, assesses the suitability of the software used for performing compositional manipulations, and evaluates the qualities of immersion and intuitive feedback which virtual reality based modelling can offer in the design visualisation process.

In this paper, we describe our traditional approach to the computer systems engineering capstone course, as well as the approach adopted during the research project, in which the students were allowed to develop an interdisciplinary, team-oriented design project. In evaluating the impact of a collaborative approach on the capstone experience, we found fundamental differences in the student experience well beyond the expected organizational differences in the presentation of course material. Although both approaches were required to develop a similar set of core competencies, the manner in which students acquired those skills were quite distinct. For example, while our traditional approach develops a systems-oriented design perspective through the detailed analysis of a carefully structured case study, the collaborative approach adopted during our research program required students to use team-oriented development and the analysis of design alternatives to develop a similar systems-oriented perspective. Our paper concludes with an analysis of the strengths and shortcomings of each instructional approach and a discussion of how a traditional capstone course can be enhanced by incorporating instructional methods for collaborative, team-oriented design.","0190-5848;01905848","POD:0-7803-4762-5","10.1109/FIE.1998.736895","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=736895","","Automotive engineering;Collaboration;Computer aided software engineering;Computer science;Design engineering;Design methodology;Educational institutions;Engineering drawings;Systems engineering and theory;Vehicles","computer science education;educational courses","Arizona State University;Computer Science and Engineering Department;capstone course;collaborative projects;computer systems engineering capstone course;interdisciplinary team-oriented design project;multi-semester NSF-sponsored research project;student experience;systems-oriented design perspective;systems-oriented perspective;team-oriented collaborative project;team-oriented development","","4","","8","","","","4-7 Nov. 1998","04 Nov 1998-07 Nov 1998","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This second factor may slow the technological progress achieved through academic research. In order to improve the chances of new discoveries in the computer science field, new graduates must be trained for critical thinking and motivated to pursue academic careers. This paper discusses the preparation of computer science undergraduate students for future participation in new discoveries through the pursuit of an academic career or more in-depth industry research. This preparation is conducted through a research methodology that improves the motivation of undergraduate students to seek new discoveries. First results of applying such a methodology in a study focused on developing new computer architecture features and supporting theory are presented.

In USC's first semester MS level software engineering core course, we have been experimenting with case study and role playing approaches to learning about software requirements engineering. The role playing approach involves a Theory W (win win) interpretation of software requirements as negotiated stakeholder win conditions. Students form three person teams to role play as the users, customers, and developers of a software application system (e.g., a library information system or an urban fire dispatching system).

Hypermedia represents one major segment in this market. Though the advances in multimedia technology have enabled us to create dazzling displays of hypermedia instructional material, its instructional efficacy is somewhat unclear. In part this is due to the often simplistic cause and effect models used to evaluate hypermedia applications. Such simplistic models tend to obscure outcomes. Moreover, they ignore the theories that would explain when and how hypermedia instruction might be efficacious. To this effect, the authors offer a research methodology which incorporates an evaluation model. The model, heavily based in hypermedia learning theories, is used to examine the efficacy of a hypermedia system called KARTT, the Knowledge Acquisition Research Training and Teaching Tool","","POD:0-8186-7105-X","10.1109/MMCS.1995.484916","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=484916","","Application software;Computer aided instruction;Computer aided software engineering;Computer industry;Control systems;Displays;Education;Industrial training;Knowledge acquisition;Multimedia systems","computer aided instruction;hypermedia;knowledge acquisition;multimedia computing","KARTT;Knowledge Acquisition Research Training and Teaching Tool;case study;educational applications;evaluation model;hypermedia evaluation;hypermedia instructional material;hypermedia learning theories;instructional efficacy;methodology;multimedia applications","","0","","32","","","","15-18 May 1995","15 May 1995-18 May 1995","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nonengineering majors such as History majors may take the Systems Engineering sequence and Spanish majors may take the Computer Science sequence. Within the Computer Science program the sequence courses are taken simultaneously by majors and nonmajors. Designing a senior-level capstone course began in 1996. The course was conducted in Fall 1998. Computer Information Systems Design had 120 students; 28 of which were CS Majors and 92 were enrolled as sequence students. Several indicators were tracked against the assumptions used for course design. As expected, the CS majors tended to have a higher course-end grade average than the sequencers. On individual events majors attained higher averages by spending approximately one half the time spent by sequencers. When working as groups, which were comprised of both sequencers and majors, the grades were equivalent but the majors put twice the effort into the requirement. Through the semester several nonquantitative indicators reflected a greater difference in student-level expectations for the course than anticipated. One unexpected result was that both types of student felt that the course was unfair with respect to their type. With these quantitative and subjective results, we can map changes onto the course which ensure a valid capstone software engineering experience for both majors and nonmajors.","0190-5848;01905848","POD:0-7803-5643-8","10.1109/FIE.1999.840373","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840373","","Art;Civil engineering;Computer science;History;Information systems;Mechanical engineering;Military computing;Natural languages;Processor scheduling;Systems engineering and theory","computer science education;educational courses","Computer Information Systems Design;United States Military Academy;course-end grade average;engineering programs;five course engineering sequence;senior computer science capstone sequence;senior-level capstone course design;student-level expectations","","0","","3","","","","10-13 Nov. 1999","10 Nov 1999-13 Nov 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, at this level the material is relatively abstract and not oriented towards a design or a project. These facts have been long recognized and recently several computer teaching aids have been developed. At the University of Victoria, the electromagnetic field theory is taught for 4 months, 3 hours of classes per week. Until a year ago, there was also a one hour tutorial per week. It was decided to substitute for it, four sessions of computer laboratory of 3 hours each. Additional access to this laboratory is also provided during off-hours. Initially we developed this laboratory using software from CAEME and the University of Utah, adding more quizzes. While generally well received, several problems were experienced.

During the last seven years an undergraduate DSP course has been offered as a senior technical elective to electrical and computer engineering students at Cal Poly State University. In parallel with theory and experiments, teams of two or three students propose, design and implement a DSP project and demonstrate the product. The effort and time that is required to complete a project is comparable to three or four experiments. Interested students pursue further DSP work as a senior project, which is a two quarter activity equivalent to 5 quarter units. More DSP design may be carried out under the category of individual-study. In terms of complexity, novelty, challenge and relation to real-world applications, the projects vary. Some are done minimally to satisfy the DSP course requirement at the passing level. Some are innovative, sophisticated, and worthy of industrial consideration, indicating students' facility with the hardware and programming and advanced use of computers. The paper analyzes the experience with undergraduate DSP projects, describes some examples, and draws conclusions. One conclusion is that the project is an essential component of a comprehensive learning experience in DSP. For this to materialize, the project needs to be planned according to the qualification and interest of individual teams and students. The aim of the paper is to document and summarize the Cal Poly experience, disseminating the results, and to present roadmaps for similar activities to interested colleagues elsewhere.","0190-5848;01905848","POD:0-7803-5643-8","10.1109/FIE.1999.840338","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=840338","","Application software;Computer industry;Digital signal processing;Electrical engineering computing;Engineering students;Hardware;Industrial relations;Qualifications","digital signal processing chips;educational courses;electrical engineering education;project engineering;student experiments","Cal Poly State University;DSP boards design;FIR filters;IIR filters;adaptive filters;communication applications;computer engineering students;control applications;design projects;electrical engineering students;image processing;learning experience;linear predictive coding;music synthesis;noise reduction;programming;senior project;senior technical elective;signal detection;speech synthesis;student teams;touch-tone dialing;undergraduate DSP course;undergraduate DSP laboratory","","0","","","","","","10-13 Nov. 1999","10 Nov 1999-13 Nov 1999","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although sitting in front of the computer causes the student to think that he or she is getting closer to a working program with every passing minute, the student may actually spend more time on the program than necessary. More time is spent because the student may have written the program with the wrong approach and figured that out only after many hours of debugging. Further, the program may not be organized very well, which also leads to long debugging periods. To help the student streamline the development of programs, formulating a design of the program was necessary before actual code could be written in a senior-level file structures course. The design component became necessary as the instructor watched students fail to complete the more complex B-tree and hashing programs. The design component also confirmed the correct or incorrect thought processes of the student so that incorrect notions could be corrected before programming was completed. The design component includes drawing the file structure to be implemented and examples of the operations upon it. The design then goes into further detail by requiring the student to split the problem up into subprograms specified in pseudocode.

The bimodal nature of cognitive styles was examined in order to assess the full ramification of cognitive styles on learning. Students' cognitive styles were analysed using cognitive style analysis (CSA) software. On the basis of the CSA results, students used either matched or mismatched CBI material. Analysing test results suggests that certain test tasks may be more suitable to certain cognitive styles than others. Results also support the reported argument that subject types have an affinity to certain cognitive styles and acknowledge the need to consider the nature of the subject matter in designing personalised CBI instruction. The consistent better performance by the matched group suggests potential for further investigations where the limitations cited here may be eliminated.

A Georgia Tech TQM class utilized a groupware system for brainstorming and ranking priorities. Specifically, the students responded to the question: “Given your understanding of the TQM principles of continuous improvement, if you could make one recommendation to the President of Georgia Tech about how he could improve the Tech experience, what would you recommend?” The study was conducted in 14 one-hour lab settings with an average group size of eight students. The groupware system was configured for anonymity. Within each session, the students could see and respond to each other's comments in real time. The groupware enabled them to observe their communication process, to “listen” to one another and realize the benefit of team dialogue.

Our course incorporates immediate concept demonstration using running courseware examples that graphically illustrate practical application of the underlying theory. These examples, for instance, allow direct mapping from theoretical discussions of relational algebra to SQL implementation and finally to query-by-example construction. The traditional course culminated in a final project of limited practical use. This delayed mastery of the theory until completion of the course project, still leaving students without a meaningful product to show for their efforts. With direct application of the theory in our course, understanding is immediate. This allows successful integration of an early project of equal magnitude to the usual final design project.

Teaching and Learning in an Era of Change","20020806","1997","2","","702 vol.2","","Summary form only given. Designing educational software for undergraduate engineering students is a difficult and complex task. Traditional software development methodologies are ""user centered"", focused on optimizing performance or facilitating the accomplishment of a task, and thus do not address all of the intricacies involved. Thus we propose the development of a ""learner centered"" design methodology to specifically address these educational needs. We define learner centered design (LCD) as a design process where the primary use of the artifact generated during the design process is for learning, rather than performance. However this does not preclude the fact that improved task performance may be a desired side-effect. In addition we claim the best examples of learner centered designs will be anchored in a theory of learning, that is an understanding of who the targeted learners are and what their needs are. While many developers have produced quality educational software that arguably meets our definition and understanding of LCD, a clear methodology seems to be lacking. Our observations show that the success of these designs, and the resulting products, are more closely related to the astute intuitions of the developers rather than on their adherence to a good methodology. We are beginning our work in the development of such a methodology by identifying and then analyzing the issues that must be addressed when developing software specifically designed to support learning.","0190-5848;01905848","POD:0-7803-4086-8","10.1109/FIE.1997.635903","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=635903","","Data analysis;Design methodology;Educational institutions;Educational technology;Engineering students;Optimization methods;Process design;Programming;Software design;Software quality","computer aided instruction;engineering education;software engineering","educational needs;educational software development;learner centered design;software development;task performance;undergraduate engineering students","","1","","","","","","5-8 Nov. 1997","05 Nov 1997-08 Nov 1997","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It leads to a better understanding and allows mastering scientific concepts and theories. The lack of the availability of practical sessions at many universities and institutions owing to the cost and the unavailability of instructors the most of the time caused a significant decline in experimentation in engineering education over the last decades. Recently, with the progress of computer-based learning, remote laboratories have been proven to be the best alternative to the traditional ones, regarding to its low cost and ubiquity. Some universities have already started to deploy remote labs in their practical sessions. This contribution compiles diverse experiences based on the deployment of the remote laboratory, Virtual Instrument Systems in Reality (VISIR), on the practices of undergraduate engineering grades at various universities within the VISIR community.

GPMS handles general and specific mathematical formulas and is packed with a vast array of codes to perform many scientific and engineering functions in an interactive mode. In order for the student to interact positively, the numerical examples in the textbook must be converted into an interactive media to support the theory and provide a deeper understanding of the physical phenomena. By this method, the students enhance their problem-solving abilities with minimal programming skills. By using examples, the paper presents an approach to computer-aided problem-solving methods for junior-level courses. The methods described in the paper have proven to be of value to students studying electric machines and power engineering at Arizona State University.","0272-1724;02721724","","10.1109/MPER.2002.4311809","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4311809","Electric circuit;MathCad;computer application;computer-aided education tools;energy conversions;teaching","Education;Mathematics;Power engineering;Power system analysis computing;Power system economics;Power system modeling;Power system protection;Power system relaying;Power system transients;Protective relaying","","","","0","","","","","","Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
