Most of all, the customer is integrated into the development process, with constant feedback. This is very similar to usability engineering (UE) which follows a spiral four phase procedure model (analysis, draft, development, test) and a three step (paper mock-up, prototype, final product) production model. In comparison, these phases are extremely shortened in XP; also the ideal team size in UE user-centered development is 4-6 people, including the end-user. The two development approaches have different goals but, at the same time, employ similar methods to achieve them. It seems obvious that there must be synergy in combining them. The authors present ideas in how to combine them in an even more powerful development method called extreme usability (XU). The most important issue of this paper is that the authors have embedded their ideas into software engineering education.","0730-3157;07303157","POD:0-7695-2413-3","10.1109/COMPSAC.2005.80","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1508106","","Design engineering;Educational programs;Feedback;Production;Programming profession;Prototypes;Software engineering;Spirals;Testing;Usability","computer science education;software engineering;user centred design","extreme programming;extreme usability;software engineering education;usability engineering;user-centered development","","3","","15","","","","26-28 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this research, academic website quality evaluation is conducted using ISO/IEC 9126 in Telkom University website. This evaluation is conducted to ascertain whether there is any characteristics of the website that need to be improved. Users in this case were students from different faculty and study. The evaluation is focused on characteristics of functionality, reliability, usability and efficiency. Based on the evaluation results we obtained three characteristics that need to be improved, they are reliability, usability and functionality. The reliability test found that efficiency was unreliable characteristic, so it was excluded in the analysis and recommendations for further improvement.","","DVD:978-1-4799-7751-2; Electronic:978-1-4799-7752-9; POD:978-1-4799-7753-6","10.1109/ICoICT.2015.7231426","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7231426","ISO/IEC 9126;Q-score;academic website;evaluation;kano model;quality model","IEC Standards;ISO Standards;Navigation;Reliability;Usability","IEC standards;ISO standards;Web sites;educational institutions;software performance evaluation;software quality;software reliability;software reusability","ISO/IEC 9126 characteristics;Telkom University academic Website;Website characteristics;Website efficiency;Website functionality;Website quality evaluation standard;Website reliability;Website usability;academic Website quality evaluation;academic activities;education realm;reliability test;software quality evaluation","","1","","18","","","","27-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Offering such activities to distance education students is both difficult and expensive. Remote Access Laboratory (RAL) systems are gaining popularity to provide students with access to on-campus rigs or hardware. Such RAL systems are equally versatile in providing on-campus software access to distance students. In the discipline of Surveying and Spatial Science, the RAL system is being used as an avenue for providing Geographic Information System (GIS) software access to distance students. In this study, the effectiveness of RAL based software activities in supporting student learning is investigated as part of a larger study involving its general use. This project investigates the research question whether RAL-based software activities can address the same learning outcomes as face-to-face practical classes. Data collected from students' discussion forum and via interviews with teaching staff members were analysed. This project provides a clear case in which the use of RAL technology has provided inclusive educational opportunities more efficiently. The key outcomes that students can achieve similar learning outcomes undertaking the activities remotely, system access and usability are critical, the learning activity needs to be supported by comprehensive learning materials and the staff effort to develop such an activity is considerable. These general results are also applicable to experiments that involve physical hardware.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6346-4; POD:978-1-4673-6345-7; USB:978-1-4673-6344-0","10.1109/REV.2013.6502897","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6502897","Conceptual experimentation;Geographic Information Systems;Remote Access Laboratories;software experiments","Computational modeling;Hardware;Laboratories","distance learning;geographic information systems","distance education student;gaining popularity;geographic information system software access;inclusive learning opportunity;laboratory based learning activity;remote access laboratory system;software based remote access laboratory;usability","","0","","13","","","","6-8 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These metrics are: Time of user feedback, average of using help methods, average of using undo, average time spent in any page, and average of using e-learning system's search engine. We focused to measure the using of e-systems rather than the content of the systems. These metrics cover the three parts of usability (ease of use, ease to learning, and task matching).

It is also a typical of activity that can be costly if mismanaged. Many factors can lead the success and also can cause software project failure. The failure actually can be detected early if we can adopt the concept of risk management and implemented it into software development project. SERIM is a method to measure risk in software engineering, proposed by Karolak [4]. SERIM is based on the mathematics of probability. SERIM uses some parameters which are derived from risk factors. The factors are: Organization, Estimation, Monitoring, Development Methodology, Tools, Risk Culture, Usability, Correctness, Reliability and Personnel. Each factor then measured by some questions metrics and there is 81 software metric questions for all factors. The factors then related and mapped into SDLC phases and risk management activities to calculate the probability (P). SERIM uses 28 probability variables to assess the risk potentials. The SERIM method then implemented to assess the risk of information system development, TrainSys, which is developed for a training and education unit in an organization. The result is useful to determine the low probability of TrainSys project success factor.

Mature engineering industries are recognized by projects and products that are, to some extent, reproducible. Yet, reproducibility in software engineering (SE) has not been investigated thoroughly, despite the fact that lack of reproducibility has both practical and scientific consequences. We report a longitudinal multiple-case study of variations and reproducibility in software development, from bidding to deployment, on the basis of the same requirement specification. In a call for tender to 81 companies, 35 responded. Four of them developed the system independently. The firm price, planned schedule, and planned development process, had, respectively, ldquolow,rdquo ldquolow,rdquo and ldquomediumrdquo reproducibilities. The contractor's costs, actual lead time, and schedule overrun of the projects had, respectively, ldquomedium,rdquo ldquohigh,rdquo and ldquolowrdquo reproducibilities. The quality dimensions of the delivered products, reliability, usability, and maintainability had, respectively, ldquolow,rdquo ""high,rdquo and ldquolowrdquo reproducibilities. Moreover, variability for predictable reasons is also included in the notion of reproducibility. We found that the observed outcome of the four development projects matched our expectations, which were formulated partially on the basis of SE folklore.

While simulations are important instructional tools, they do not fully emulate the lab learning environment. The validity of the on-line lab approach was validated in 2002 when ABET published draft standards for on-line lab sessions. Collaboration, namely students working in teams on lab exercises, is a key ingredient in creating an effective lab experience. While work continues globally on development, a definitive approach does not yet exist for the design of virtual collaborative learning methodologies. Accordingly, the design of remote lab delivery systems that foster and support virtual or social presence is an important issue as this technology continues to advance. This paper reviews the pedagogical basis for presence and collaboration in the remote lab environment and presents summary data from research involving the usability and performance of commercially available web collaboration tools to deliver remote lab learning experiences. The remote lab involved in the study allows students to execute lab exercises on industrial automation equipment including educational robots, programmable logic controllers, and associated peripheral hardware and software.","0190-5848;01905848","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1970-8; POD:978-1-4244-1969-2","10.1109/FIE.2008.4720394","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4720394","Collaboration;Distance Education;Presence;Remote Lab","Collaboration;Collaborative tools;Collaborative work;Computer industry;Design methodology;Educational technology;Internet;Laboratories;Standards publication;Usability","Internet;computer aided instruction;distance learning;engineering education;groupware;laboratory techniques;student experiments","Internet interfacing technology;Web collaboration tool;distance education;engineering education;remote lab delivery system;virtual collaborative learning methodology","","9","","30","","","","22-25 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each of these two disciplines is now well represented with respect to most computer science (CS) curricula. However, the two disciplines are practiced almost independently - missing opportunities to collaborate, coordinate and communicate about the overall design - and thereby contributing to system failures. Today, a confluence of several ingredients contribute to these failures: the increasing importance of the user interface (UI) component in the overall system, the independent maturation of the human computer interaction area, and the lack of a cohesive process model to integrate the UI experts usability engineering (UE) development efforts with that of software engineering (SE). This in turn, we believe, is a result of a void in computing curricula: a lack of education and training regarding the importance of communication, collaboration and coordination between the SE and UE processes. In this paper we describe the current approach to teaching SE and UE and its shortcomings. We identify and analyze the barriers and issues involved in developing systems having substantial interactive components. We then propose four major themes of learning for a comprehensive computing curriculum integrating SE, UE, and system architectures in a project environment.","0190-5848;01905848","POD:0-7803-8552-7","10.1109/FIE.2004.1408713","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1408713","","Collaboration;Computer architecture;Computer science;Computer science education;Human computer interaction;Proposals;Software engineering;Software systems;Usability;User interfaces","computer science education;educational courses;human computer interaction;software engineering;user interfaces","HCI-SE curriculum;computer science curriculum;experts usability engineering;human computer interaction;software engineering;system failures;usability engineering;user interface","","0","","18","","","","20-23 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through a sophomore-level software engineering course, students were grouped into 12 to 17 person teams to work on a project for an external client. The students went through the entire software engineering process from requirements to implementation and placed all documents and software on the World Wide Web. The English students, in a technical writing course, reviewed the documents of the computer science students, conducted usability studies, and wrote the user's manual for the systems.

In UK academia, there is a chronic shortage of able candidates to fill posts at all levels, from research students (through research fellows and lecturers) to professors. It is clear from salaries being offered in industry that it is a “seller's market”. However, since thousands of students graduate each year in the UK with computing degrees, questions must be asked about the extent to which software engineering is addressed within these courses. It is impossible to consider software engineering curricula without giving acknowledgement to the impact of human factors, organisational issues and cultural norms. Therefore, in looking at software engineering education, I believe we need to devise syllabuses that not only address technical issues (such as the object-oriented paradigm, metrics or metaCASE technology) but also the “sociotechnical” concerns (such as the usability of systems and the requirement to engineer systems to situationally specific work practices). Identifying what should be taught is only part of the problem; the other part is how.

However, despite the growing interest in mobile English language learning, there have been no reviews of research conducted on this subject. This paper represents the first attempt to provide a comprehensive analysis of the existing literature (2010-2015) to identify the taxonomy and distribution of research as well as to identify the advantages and challenges and provide some recommendations to facilitate the effective use of mobile English language learning and its applications. Following a review protocol, articles on mobile English language learning from six major databases (IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, ERIC, SpringerLink, and Wiley Online Library) were reviewed. Applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 133 related articles were identified. The results show that the majority of studies were conducted on application m-learning technologies. Pure mobile applications were the most widely-used applications in the English m-learning context. Meanwhile, concerns regarding quality, usability, integration, financial costs, security and privacy, pedagogical practice, and safety were found to be the main challenges of mobile English language learning. Finally, some recommendations are provided for users, developers/providers, and researchers. The results of this paper can assist users, researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in the education sector to allocate the necessary resources and make plans to mitigate the challenges and facilitate the effective use of mobile English language learning in educational practices.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2749541","University of Malaya&#8217;s Postgraduate Research; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8032487","English language;Mobile learning;blended application;pure mobile application;taxonomy","Databases;Education;Libraries;Mobile applications;Mobile communication;Systematics;Taxonomy","human factors;linguistics;mobile learning","ERIC database;English language acquisition;English m-learning context;IEEE Xplore database;ScienceDirect database;SpringerLink database;Web of Science database;Wiley Online Library database;exclusion criteria;financial cost factor;financial costs;inclusion criteria;integration factor;m-learning;mobile English language learning;pedagogical practice;privacy factor;quality factor;recommendations mobile learning;safety factor;security factor;usability factor","","","","","","OAPA","20170912","2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Thus best of the project fail to generate a product that is usable. This paper presents a case study of minor project course which incorporated UX design in building mobile apps. UX is new technology and little known to instructors at colleges. So students were instructed to learn UX from MOOC on 'UX Design for Mobile Developer's', hosted by Udacity. Also, a workshop by industry expert in UX was conducted. The UX activities specified by MOOC were included as part course assessments. Through the UX design, students identified 3 to 4 user/ mobile device requirements and incorporated them in the implementation. The weightage of marks for UX design is 24%, which increased Design phase weightage to 30%. Finally students were able to launch product, 'KLE Tech STUDio' mobile-app. Attainment of design phase, UX, activities specified by MOOC, implementations are 7.2, 7.82, 6.8 and 7.5 respectively on the scale of 10.

We conducted a systematic literature review of usability defect reporting drawing from both the usability and software engineering literature from January 2000 until March 2016. As a result, a total of 57 studies were identified, in which we classified the studies into three categories: reporting usability defect information, analysing usability defect data and key challenges. Out of these, 20 were software engineering studies and 37 were usability studies. The results of this systematic literature review show that usability defect reporting processes suffer from a number of limitations, including: mixed data, inconsistency of terms and values of usability defect data, and insufficient attributes to classify usability defects.

However, there is a shortage of electronic design automation (EDA) software tools adaptable to AQFP logic. Such tools are essential for designing large-scale-integration circuits efficiently. Therefore, we have developed a first set of EDA tools that handle cell placement and wiring, written in SKILL, the Cadence scripting language. Our tools also consider the maximum wire length constraint that exists in AQFP logic. First, AQFP logic cells are repositioned via the genetic algorithm to minimize the number of wires that violate the wiring length constraint. Buffers are then automatically inserted as signal repeaters for logic rows where the violations still exist. We then complete the logic wiring of the circuit using the channel routing algorithm. We demonstrate the usability of the EDA tools by designing a 16-bit adder as well as a randomly generated test circuit.","1051-8223;10518223","","10.1109/TASC.2017.2721965","Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S); University of Tokyo in collaboration with Cadence Design Systems, Inc.; VLSI Design and Education Center; 10.13039/501100001667 - Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7964776","Adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP);channel routing;electronic design automation (EDA);genetic algorithm","Clocks;Layout;Logic gates;Routing;Tools;Wires;Wiring","adders;electronic design automation;genetic algorithms;large scale integration;network routing;parametric oscillators","AQFP logic cells;Cadence scripting language;EDA software tool;EDA tool placement;EDA tool routing;SKILL;adder;adiabatic switching operation;cell placement;channel routing algorithm;electronic design automation;energy-efficient superconductor logic;genetic algorithm;large-scale adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron circuits;large-scale-integration circuits;logic wiring;maximum wire length constraint;randomly-generated test circuit;zero static power dissipation","","","","","","","20170630","Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To determine blind users' experience with responsive design, the authors performed empirical tests to investigate the impact of responsive design on the emotions of blind users during web interactions. They measured user emotions by applying the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) instrument. Results show that although the responsive websites investigated had acceptable levels of accessibility, they posed numerous usability barriers and triggered intense, negative user emotions.

Thus, to support beginners better, we need to understand how theworkflow of people with different prevalent personality traits using these tools varies. For this purpose, we observed users' solution strategies and correlated them with their prevalent personality traits in an exploratory study with student participants within a controlled experiment. We gathered data by screen capturing and chat protocols as well as a Big Five personality traits test. We found strong correlations between particular personality traits and different strategies of removing the findings of static code analysis as well as between personality and tool utilization.

"Gradual structuring: Evolving the spreadsheet paradigm for expressiveness and learnability","G. Miller; F. Hermans; R. Braun","School of Computing and Communications, University of Technology Sydney","2016 15th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training (ITHET)","20161201","2016","","","1","8","Spreadsheets are arguably the most used form of programming and are frequently used in higher education to teach fundamental concepts about computation. Their success has shown that they are simple enough for a huge number of end users to learn and use. This is in contrast to traditional programming languages and the high dropout rate from introductory programming and computer science. However in comparison to traditional programming languages and structured modelling, spreadsheets are not expressive, placing a limit on the levels of computational thinking that can be taught using the spreadsheet paradigm. This limitation is imposed by the lack of programming language features and abstractions in the paradigm. Furthermore, more advanced spreadsheet features (e.g. array formulae, lookup formulae, R1C1 syntax) can be difficult to learn and use. This paper discusses the idea of adding language features to spreadsheets, enabling the gradual structuring of free-form spreadsheets to more structured models. We propose that this concept is termed Gradual Structuring, and is analogous to the programming language concept of gradual typing. In this analogy, spreadsheets take the place of dynamic programming and structured modelling of static programming. In programming languages, gradual typing allows dynamic programming to be mixed with static programming. It is our contention that dynamic programming is more learnable while static programming is more expressive and abstract. Gradual typing could be used to mitigate the issues in the teaching of traditional programming. Likewise Gradual Structuring can mitigate the conceptual limits that can be taught using current spreadsheets. The key language feature required to enable Gradual Structuring is the ability to logically group cells together so that a single formula can be applied to the grouped cells. This concept, termed cell grouping diminishes and can even eliminate the need for the ubiquitous and error-prone use of copy-p- sted in spreadsheets. Moreover, it makes the structure present in spreadsheet models explicit. Cell grouping requires a cascade of other new languages features. Namely a more expressive referencing style, which in turned requires enabling labels to be moved to the row and column headers, and the hierarchical structuring of these headers. Respectively these language features are termed enhanced referencing and semantic axes. The ongoing research focusses on the usability and learnability of these language features.

"Assessing Students' Conceptual Knowledge of Computer Networks in Open Wonderland","K. Alse; L. Ganesh; P. Prasad; M. Chang; S. Iyer","","2016 IEEE 16th International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT)","20161201","2016","","","513","517","Computer Networks, an undergraduate computer science course, is taught through a variety of new technological tools but more attention on assessment strategies using those technological tools is desirable. Research studies have shown that assessment methods also influence students' learning. Current assessment techniques, even those which include technology, focus more on summative assessment rather than formative. Formative assessment is necessary for teaching and assessment of complex skills like troubleshooting or network design. Therefore, there exists a need for assessments to capture students' problem solving process and chosen approaches during the assessment. By tracking a student's behaviors in an immersive assessment environment, the path that the student takes towards the solution can be studied. Virtual Worlds are naturally immersive environments and can be effectively used to record interactions that students made in the worlds. We have developed NetWorld in Open Wonderland, an open source software for creating 3D virtual worlds. NetWorld is a 3D virtual world built for detailed assessment of computer network concepts for computer science undergraduate students. This detailed assessment happens at 3 levels -- conceptual understanding, diagnostic abilities and the ability to design a network. This paper describes the design principles and implementation of NetWorld and a plan to evaluate its usability.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9041-5; POD:978-1-4673-9042-2","10.1109/ICALT.2016.22","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757038","Computer Networks;Conceptual Knowledge;E-Assessment;Open Wonderland;Simulations;Virtual World","Computer networks;Computers;Education;Knowledge engineering;Problem-solving;Three-dimensional displays;XML","behavioural sciences computing;computer aided instruction;computer networks;computer science education;human computer interaction;public domain software;teaching;virtual reality","3D virtual worlds;NetWorld;complex skill assessment;complex skill teaching;computer networks;computer science undergraduate students;natural immersive environments;open Wonderland;open source software;student behaviors;student conceptual knowledge assessment;student learning;technological tools;undergraduate computer science course","","","","","","","","25-28 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, designing, developing, and deploying adaptive and mobile-oriented user interfaces for existing process engines are non-trivial, and require significant systematic efforts. To address this issue, we present a novel middleware-based approach, called MUIT, to developing and deploying the Mobility, User Interactions and Tasks into WS-BPEL engines. MUIT provides a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that provides some intuitive facilities to support the declarative development of adaptive, mobile-oriented, and Web-based user interfaces in WS-BPEL. The DSL can significantly reduce developers’ manual efforts of developing user interactions by preventing arbitrarily mixed code, and its runtime supports satisfactory user experiences. Additionally, MUIT can be seamlessly integrated into WS-BPEL without intrusions of existing process instances. We implement a proof-of-concept prototype by integrating MUIT into the commodity WS-BPEL-based Apusic Platform, and evaluate the performance and usability of MUIT platform.","1939-1374;19391374","","10.1109/TSC.2016.2633535","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7762930","WS-BPEL;human tasks;mobile;web programming","Business;DSL;Engines;Mobile communication;Smart phones;User interfaces","","","","","","","","","20161201","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are one of such advanced means to access educational material and resources anywhere/anytime in the world. Invention of cloud computing technology has opened many options for organizations and individual to share the educational resources among students. By adopting cloud computing organizations can save various recurring costs such as ICT hardware/software, licensing, storage space, backups, maintenance and human resources. Cloud computing enables teachers and students to access and approach the academic material ubiquitously through portable appliances (smart phones, tablets, IPAD's etc.). There are numerous public cloud applications (offerings) available for accessing educational resources in urban as well as rural vicinity. The Usability evaluation of these cloud-based services in a particular academic atmosphere is significant prior to their adoption. Moreover, this enables the stakeholders to make better decisions to adopt these contemporary services. In this paper we present the usability evaluation of public cloud applications across three universities in Pakistan from stakeholders' perspective i.e. (teachers and students).

The main concept behind this project is to setup the interface for rapid interaction design. Eye tracking is a powerful tool for hands free communication but for that requires a dedicated software. This software is rarely tailored for a specific needs of a potential user. It means that people who wants to explore gaze driven computer interfaces often need to create their own eye tracking software or need to have certain computer skills to be able to go through the software development kit (SDK) provided by the eye tracker vendors. It makes designing interaction by gaze quite challenging. The eGlasses eye tracking module was used to extend sensor values available in Scratch by the information about pupil position, gaze position and eye opened/eye closed signal. In this paper we have tested if the gaze data acquired by the eGlasses are reliable and can be used as an input signal for rapid interaction design using Scratch. The whole interface was validated regarding the system usability score (SUS). The purpose of our work is to support disabled children and their therapists but also to give a chance to a wider community, without computational skills, to easily check they ideas for gaze based interaction.

As a consequence, examinations as well as didactical approaches need to become competence-oriented. Unfortunately, competence-oriented examinations and assessments of the efficacy of didactical approaches are fairly hard - currently, no generally accepted approaches for competence-oriented evaluation are available. To make things worse, software engineering is a complex subject matter. Therefore, intended learning outcomes in software engineering education also tend to be quite complex and vary widely with a course's context. This paper provides details on how SECAT, a Software Engineering Competence Assessment Tool, is used to assess the efficacy of didactical approaches in software engineering education in a competence-oriented matter. To that end, SECAT needs to be adapted to the specific context, namely a particular didactical approach with its associated intended learning outcomes. Intended learning outcomes are related to specific competences, including non-technical skills. The paper presents results from applying SECAT for assessing the efficacy of employed didactical approaches in several software engineering courses. Furthermore, the paper shows an example of how SECAT's assessment results are used to improve didactical approaches for upcoming instances of these courses.

Two similar mobile applications were developed with two different interfaces: a sketch-based interface and an image-based interface. Both interfaces were tested on 50 illiterates and 49 students of software engineering to evaluate usability of the application for illiterates. The results showed that the specific hand drawn sketches visualizing different First-Aid activities were better understood by the illiterates as compared to image based interfaces. In addition there was no clear difference of usage between literates and illiterates while they were using sketch based interfaces which shows sketch based interfaces are more usable for both types of users. However, there were significant differences of usage between literates and illiterates while using image based interfaces application showing non-usability of image based interfaces for illiterate population.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-9665-3; Electronic:978-1-4673-9666-0; POD:978-1-4673-9667-7","10.1109/FIT.2015.68","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7420988","First Aid;First-Aid application;ICT application;illiterate","Injuries;Mobile applications;Mobile communication;Sociology;Statistics;Usability","first aid;iOS (operating system);medical computing;mobile computing;user interfaces","ICT solution;KPK Pakistan;Mardan;first-aid application;first-aid guidance;iOS mobile application;illiterate population education;image-based interface;iphone operating system mobile application;sketch-based interface;usability evaluation","","","","21","","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper addresses the bidirectional coupling between a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) haptic feedback device and a general-purpose modelling and simulation environment. In particular, an open-source library is developed to couple the Force Dimension omega.7 haptic device with the 20-sim modelling and simulation environment. The presented coupling interface is also compatible with all the different haptic devices produced by Force Dimension. The proposed integrated haptic interface makes it possible to track the user's motion, detect collisions between the user-controlled probe and virtual objects, compute reaction forces in response to motion or contacts and exert an intuitive force feedback on the user. A real-time one-to-one correspondence between reality and virtual reality can be transparently created. This allows for a variety of possible applications. Stability issues, performance issues, design and virtual prototyping challenges can be addressed and investigated for research purposes. In addition, design and virtual prototyping are also of interest to industry. Realistic training environments can be developed for the user considering different possible operations and stressing the importance of usability and user experience. Experiments based on using haptics technology in the field of education can also be easily performed. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed coupling, a case study is presented.

In this paper, the emphasis is on human characteristics, rather than on the formal properties of programming and modeling languages. Do the involved computing practitioners refer to the same concepts when they use the same words? A preliminary version of this study [1] addressed the assessment of differences in mental representations of abstract entities involved in programming and modeling.

In recent years, various software assignment techniques have been designed to introduce heterogeneity into network hosts for the maximum network survivability. However, few work consider practical constraints involved in the software assignment process. To close such a gap, in this work we model the software assignment problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, which incorporates several real-world criteria simultaneously, including network survivability, system feasibility and usability. To solves this multi-objective problem efficiently, we propose an ant colony optimization (ACO) based algorithm, where colonies of artificial ants work collaboratively through both heuristic information and pheromone-mediated communication to iteratively search for better solutions. To validate the generalizability of the proposed method, we experiment our algorithm on various types of network topologies with different parameter settings. The results show that our model can be applied as an effective method for assigning software for multiple objectives. The experimental results also provide interesting insights for optimal software assignment.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7876-5; POD:978-1-4673-7877-2","10.1109/CNS.2015.7346840","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346840","","Computers;Network topology;Security;Software algorithms;Software packages;Usability","Internet;ant colony optimisation;computer network reliability;computer network security;invasive software;iterative methods","ACO based algorithm;Internet worm;active cyber defense;ant colony optimization based algorithm;malicious attack;multiobjective optimization problem;multiobjective software assignment;network survivability;network topology;pheromone-mediated communication;software diversity;well-accepted security principle","","","","25","","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper presents the comparison of mostly used web conferencing tools nowadays, based on several criteria: functionality, security, software installation, meeting setup and usability. Main aim of this paper was to evaluate the effectiveness of using web conference in teaching programming, for face-to-face and blended learning students. Web conference lectures were applied in the class on four out of ten courses in total, in the second year of the studies. The summative analysis of the pass rate and the average mark for both groups of students has been carried out in these courses.

From the research point of view the authors want to (1) frame the development of the tool in the socio-constructivist paradigm, and (2) bring the learner-centeredness via participatory design. The paper reports a series of workshops in which HCI students were asked to design a mobile tool for learning programming. The workshops followed the participatory design methodology. Each workshop set its very participants into a scenario different than other workshops by means of variation in introductory tools. The participants output -- in the form of design ideas described with tools like sketches, storyboards, and/or simple text -- at each workshop was then collected. These ideas were classified according to five categories: socio-constructivist, learning management, usability, software visualization, and miscellaneous. Usability and socio-constructivist accounted for the majority of the ideas. The number usability ideas can be partly explained because of the context (participants were HCI students). However, the abundance of socio-constructivist ideas points to the importance which students give to learning in a sociocultural context. Moreover, the sheer amount of ideas -- otherwise not envisioned by the designers -- explains the need to build mlearning tools in a participatory fashion. Thus, the results of experiments support authors' stand of designing such tools in a learner-centered participatory fashion and framing the development in socio-constructivist paradigm.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9967-5; POD:978-1-4799-9968-2","10.1109/LaTiCE.2015.35","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7126243","Computer Science Education;Mlearning;Participatory Design;Software Visualization","Conferences;Context;Education;Games;Mobile communication;Usability;Visualization","computer aided instruction;computer science education;human computer interaction;mobile learning;software engineering","HCI students;Jeliot Mobile tool;design ideas;learner-centered participatory framework;learner-centeredness;learning management idea;miscellaneous idea;participatory design methodology;programming learning;sketch tool;socio-constructivist ideas;socio-constructivist m-learning tool;sociocultural context;software visualization idea;storyboard tool;text tool;usability idea","","3","","26","","","","9-12 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This educational paradigm is of paramount importance for society nowadays, because expands access opportunities to education at all levels. These learning environments can take advantage of Open Educational Resources. Using OER is a growing trend and it is turning into a recommendation by some governments and international education forums. Nevertheless, in spite of the availability of OER websites, quite a few of them do not consider accessibility design principles, therefore these websites present access barriers for users with disabilities. Besides, only a reduce number of these websites offer accessible resources, i.e. digital contents suitable for users with disabilities. On the other hand, in web environment, findability is a design consideration that improves the user's searchable experience by simplifying the location and acquisition of elements in websites. In this restricted scenario, findability of educational resources is a key issue for users with disabilities. In this research, we address the issue of findability of Open Educational Resources (OER), from the perspective of inclusive participation of users with disabilities, by considering three aspects: web accessibility, some usability best practices oriented to users with disabilities and Information Architecture.

In this paper, researchers critically examined usability using system usability scale (SUS) on most popular enterprise resource planning system SAP, an integrated solution that incorporates the key business operation functions and processes of an organization. The purpose of this research was to investigate the influence of ERP users' demographic information like educational background and job experiences (as factors affecting users' cognitive performance) against the task of rating usability of the system.

Once the phone is locked, the user should take a specific action or provide some secret information to unlock the phone. The existing unlocking approaches can be categorized into four groups: motion, password, pattern, and fingerprint. Existing approaches do not support smart phones well due to the deficiency of security, high cost, and poor usability. We collect 200 users' handwaving actions with their smart phones and discover an appealing observation: the waving pattern of a person is kind of unique, stable and distinguishable. In this paper, we propose OpenSesame, which employs the users' waving patterns for locking/unlocking. The key feature of our system lies in using four fine-grained and statistic features of handwaving to verify users. Moreover, we utilize support vector machine (SVM) for accurate and fast classification. Our technique is robust compatible across different brands of smart phones, without the need of any specialized hardware. Results from comprehensive experiments show that the mean false positive rate of OpenSesame is around 15 percent, while the false negative rate is lower than 8 percent.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2014.2341633","Central Universities of China; Doctoral Program of Higher Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - NSFC; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6862001","Smart phone;accelerometer;authentication;privacy;security","Accelerometers;Intelligent sensors;Magnetic sensors;Mobile computing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Smart phones","biometrics (access control);message authentication;smart phones;support vector machines","OpenSesame;SVM;false positive rate;fine-grained feature;handwaving action;handwaving biometrics;screen locking;screen unlocking;secret information;smart phone;statistic feature;support vector machine;waving pattern","","6","","23","","","20140722","May 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One of the strategies is to implement the asynchronous type of interaction. An online activity in blended learning using e-learning models is known as a Learning Management System (LMS). Currently LMS has been widely applied in the educational process in higher education institutions. To assess the results of the application of the LMS, we need a quality model that can be referenced by developers of LMS. This study developed a model for the application of quality in an asynchronous blended learning system The model allows an LMS can be evaluated by a party who is not an expert in the field of software technology, especially for the users, who is usually not involved in the system development phase directly. This model is expected to be a reference for both by the developers and users. In this study, the quality of the application the model is applied based on ISO/IEC 9126. This model supports the evaluation of two primary requirements, the needs of virtual communication and the delivery of educational activities, which has seven features, namely: discussion boards, e-mail, blogs, lectures, assignments, quizzes and grades. The quality characteristics in this model, among others are the suitability of implementation, ease of procedures, flexibility (interaction, tests and learner control), user security permissions, as well as response time, availability, reliability and completeness of the system. So the quality factor is proposed functionality (suitability, accurattime behavioreness, security), reliability (maturity), usability (learnability) and efficiency (time behavior). The proposed model was validated with a case study of LMS in the Politeknik Caltex Riau (LMS PCR). The results have shown that the model could offer a quality evaluation of LMS PCR. The model has been able to demonstrate that the LMS PCR was conformed to the re- uirements of an asynchronous blended learning system.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-8477-0; Electronic:978-1-4799-8478-7; POD:978-1-4799-8479-4","10.1109/ICEECS.2014.7045251","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045251","ISO/IEC 9126;asynchronous;blended learning;learning management system","Electronic learning;IEC standards;ISO standards;Least squares approximations;Q-factor;Security;Time factors","computer aided instruction;educational institutions;further education","ISO/IEC 9126;LMS;LMS PCR;LMS in the Politeknik Caltex Riau;application model;asynchronous blended learning system;e-learning models;educational activities;educational process;higher education institutions;learning management system quality;online activity;quality model;software technology;virtual communication","","0","","37","","","","24-25 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The motivation behind this proposal is to encourage more higher learning institutions to offer variety of software engineering related programme, in particular software testing so that this area is recognized as another key contributor for developing competent testing professionals. Although there are many software testing professional certifications available in the market, there is still a need for offering this kind of programme in university at postgraduate level to nurture the importance of software testing in producing quality software. The proposed programme is designed based on coursework basis to mainly cater for the working students. As the structure emphasizes on mix of theories and practical knowledge with the use of suitable testing tools, thus the substance of this programme should at least cover the fundamentals knowledge of testing, every key types of testing performed today such as functional testing, security testing, performance testing, usability testing and compatibility testing as well as latest trends in testing such as testing in agile environment. It is expected that the proposed programme should be able to produce graduates that demonstrate advanced competencies in software testing and able to apply the acquired skills in producing high quality software.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5439-1; POD:978-1-4799-5440-7; USB:978-1-4799-5438-4","10.1109/MySec.2014.6986041","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6986041","academic;certifications;curriculum;education;postgraduate;software testing","Computer science;Educational institutions;Software;Software engineering;Software testing","computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;further education;program testing;software quality","compatibility testing;functional testing;higher learning institutions;performance testing;postgraduate level software testing;postgraduate programme;security testing;software engineering related programme;software quality;software testing professional certifications;software testing specialization;usability testing","","0","","37","","","","23-24 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This study discovers the current syllabus of SE, by focusing on the content of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) through course outlines of local institutions. The study also analyses the implementation of emphasizing usability in classrooms and its practice by surveying the lecturers and the students. It is found that what is currently lacking is the explicit method of assessing usability and making this crystal clear to students when developing software and system.

The study focuses on appropriation of the Eclipse IDE. We present an empirical view on appropriation as a means to maintain the collective ability to work. We visited seven different organizations and observed and interviewed their members. Each organization was chosen to provide an overall picture of Eclipse use throughout the industry. The results decompose the appropriation of Eclipse by software developers in organizations into four categories: learning, tailoring and discovering, as well as the cross-cutting category: collaboration. The categories are grounded in situations that provoked a need to change as well as in policies adopted for coping with this need. By discussing these categories against the background of Eclipse and its ecosystem, we want to illustrate in what ways appropriation of component- or plugin- based software is nowadays a common and highly complex challenge for Eclipse users, and how the related appropriation practices can be supported by IT systems.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2014.2354047","German Federal Ministry for Education and Research; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6898825","Programmer workbench;deployment;human factors in software design;usage experience","Computer aided software engineering;Context;Ecosystems;Employment;Interviews;Organizations;Software","object-oriented languages;object-oriented programming;software engineering","Eclipse IDE;Eclipse Integrated Development Environment;IT systems;component-based software;development environment;highly complex software systems;plugin-based software;software developers;software engineers","","1","","60","","","20140915","Nov. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Although such laboratories have the benefit of allowing students to learn from mistakes without damaging remote equipment, student learning can be limited by denying them access to real data from real equipment. The primary contribution of this article is to outline the development of several mobile apps for interacting with real physical test beds in an automatic control laboratory, both in the laboratory and remotely. Results are provided from a preliminary investigation of the usability and user experience associated with the applications, using students who would ultimately be the users of the applications when they are integrated into the curriculum. Implementation considerations such as the application development, wireless communication, hardware interfaces, and control are discussed.

An important focus over the last few years has been to discover what are the hard-to-answer questions that developers ask while they are trying to comprehend their programs, and then to develop tools to help answer those questions. For example, when studying programmers working on everyday bugs, we found that they continuously ask “Why” and “Why Not” questions as they try to comprehend what happened. We developed the “Whyline” debugging tool, which allows programmers to directly ask these questions of their programs and get a visualization of the answers. In a small lab study, Whyline increased productivity by a factor of about two. We studied professional programmers trying to understand unfamiliar code and identified over 100 questions they identified as hard-to-answer. In particular, we saw that programmers frequently had specific questions about the feasible execution paths, so we developed a new visualization tool to directly present this information. When trying to use unfamiliar APIs, such as the Java SDK and the SAP eSOA APIs, we discovered some common patterns that make programmers up to 10 times slower in finding and understanding how to use the appropriate methods, so we developed new tools to assist them.

Tablets and iPads, which are prevalent, can be utilized with dementia patients in portraying favorite music and family photographs via apps developed in close partnership with geriatric facilities. Anecdotal research has shown that non-verbal late-stage dementia patients have become stimulated when iPods played their beloved tunes. There is an unmet need in geriatric facilities for stimulating dementia patients, as well providing hard-core data for proving increased cognitive abilities with technology. Technology can help bridge the gap between patients and staff to improve the quality of life for the cognitively impaired. This study addresses cognitive functioning and quality of life for people diagnosed with dementia via technology. In recent times, the influx of older adults suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia related illness has impacted the U.S. Healthcare system. Cognition significantly declines in older adults with AD or dementia over the course of the disease, causing most to be dependent on caregivers, thus routinely institutionalized. Caregivers are often required to focus their attention on addressing the agitation or discomfort of the AD or dementia patient. Research has shown that technology instruments such as iPods, help stimulate those with dementia. This study focuses on innovative devices such as iPads and tablets, which are mainstream and easy to use, cannot only help determine stage of dementia, but also provide stimulation to improve cognitive functioning. It is hoped that this research will analyze that specially created apps and existing assistive software can be used to decrease the symptoms and improve cognition of older adults suffering from AD or other dementia related diseases. Via service-learning courses, students developed an easy-to-use application for tablets to help- older adults with disabilities more readily use the technology. Student programmers produced apps and performed usability tests with the dementia patients, as well as met with geriatric facility personnel to produce application software that meets the patients, family, and caregiver needs and expectations. For example, a student term project produced an application entitled Candoo that utilizes Google's voice recognition and synthesis engine to navigate the web, provide the weather, and supply pill reminder alerts. Another application example included one that allows families to electronically send photographs, video clips, and favorite music from anywhere to loved ones for enjoyment. Furthermore, older adults were assessed by nursing students for cognitive functioning before, and after the semester's intervention. Such mobile apps could allow dementia persons to become less agitated and stay in their homes longer, while also providing awareness and positive change of attitude by those of another generation towards the elderly. This research will discuss student developed mobile applications in the scope of helping improve the quality of life of patients with AD or dementia.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6245-0; POD:978-1-4673-6244-3","10.1109/LISAT.2013.6578252","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6578252","Accessibility;Aged User;Assistive Technologyies;Computer Science Education;Elderly;Older Adults;Senior Citizen;Software Engineering;Sundowning","Animals;Dementia;Mobile communication;Sociology;Statistics;Tablet computers","cognition;diseases;geriatrics;handicapped aids;mobile computing;patient treatment;speech recognition;speech synthesis","AD;Alzheimer patients;Candoo;Google voice recognition;Google voice synthesis engine;US healthcare system;caregiver anecdotes;cognitive abilities;cognitive functioning;geriatric facilities;iPads;iPods;mobile app development;music;nonverbal late-stage dementia patients;older adults;photographs;service-learning courses;student programmers;tablet application;usability research;usability tests;video clips","","5","","19","","","","3-3 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Using Intelligent Tutors to Teach Students How APIs Are Used for Software Engineering in Practice","V. Krishnamoorthy; B. Appasamy; C. Scaffidi","School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University","IEEE Transactions on Education","20130731","2013","56","3","355","363","Computer science courses typically incorporate integrated training in software engineering, which includes learning how to reuse existing code libraries in new programs. This commonly presents a need to use the libraries' application programming interfaces (APIs) during project-based learning activities. The students learn these APIs with little support from the instructor. Instead, they primarily learn from whatever code examples they find on the Web-a scattershot approach that is slow, frustrating, and sometimes fruitless. Preliminary work investigated an improved approach that provides students with intelligent API tutors. This interactive educational content walks students through code examples selectively harvested from the Web. This approach increased students' knowledge of API method names, but a key pedagogical challenge remained: Students still lacked an understanding of common problems and surprises that they might encounter when using APIs in practice. Perhaps even more crucially, the prior statistical study provided no information about how students would perceive and accept the intelligent tutor approach, when given a choice. Therefore, this paper presents an enhanced approach that augments intelligent tutors with selected information from online FAQs and online open-source code, thereby providing more explanation and context about how to use APIs in practice. A qualitative study assessed student perceptions of the system's usability as well as suggestions for improvement, revealing that 100% of students considered the approach to be useful. A key implication is that providing information from online FAQs, related articles, and open-source code could facilitate computer science students' learning how to use APIs.","0018-9359;00189359","","10.1109/TE.2013.2238543","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6422340","Application programming interface (API);computer science education;electronic learning;software engineering;software libraries","Computer science;Industries;Libraries;Open source software;Software engineering;Training","Internet;application program interfaces;computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;public domain software;software libraries;statistical analysis;teaching","API tutors;Web;application programming interfaces;computer science courses;computer science student learning;instructor;intelligent tutors;interactive educational content;online FAQ;online open source code;project-based learning activities;software engineering;system usability;teaching","","3","","37","","","20130128","Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Unfortunately, it is particularly challenging for students to learn this procedure and is often practiced by novice students on live patients as current simulators are ineffective. Simulators on the market are expensive, inconvenient, and often anatomically inaccurate, leading to improper student training. To address the shortcomings of current simulators, our patent-pending design includes features such as a fully rotatable head and proper anatomical landmarks. Our training simulator is ultrasoundable and can replicate both the pulsing of the arteries and the expanding of the veins under changes in fluid pressure. In addition, our simulator comes with training software allowing for tracking of students as they progress through the curriculum. We are currently performing usability testing of our prototype. Novice residents and expert practicing doctors perform CVC on our simulator for assessment of accuracy, ease of use, and training effectiveness in comparison to commercially available simulators.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5032-9; POD:978-1-4799-0624-6","10.1109/SBEC.2013.55","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6525692","","Biomedical imaging;Educational institutions;Head;Skin;Testing;Training;Ultrasonic imaging","biomedical education;blood vessels;catheters;on-the-job training","arteries;central venous catheterization simulation;drug influx;heart;jugular vein;medical training;patent pending design;subclavian vein","","0","","5","","","","3-5 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have taken advantage of Web 2.0 technologies and its participative culture to develop a collaborative platform around game design activities that encourages social learning and integrates into the students' online social presence and lifestyle. We have employed open-Web technologies to build a game design environment using only HTML5 and JavaScript that lets users practice the game design and programming activities right inside their browser. Game design and game playing run on the client while an associated website hosts the created games and supports collaboration. This paper reports on the design, implementation, and evaluation of the game design environment.

A user study was conducted in which participants were asked to find an error in a pre-assembled algorithm. Results indicate that participants using the older version of the interface (with no monitor tool) took, on average, less time to find the error than participants who used the monitor tool. However, interview responses indicated a greater level of understanding of the algorithm from participants who used the monitor tool. Interview responses also demonstrated a clear desire from users of the old interface for the addition of a debugging tool (such as the newly introduced monitor tool).

With software development projects becoming increasingly distributed, it is ever more difficult to have sufficient participants in a usability inspection and to collaboratively learn the techniques. Motivated by these problems, we developed a novel, prototype environment called INspect-World for distributed usability inspection techniques.

In addition, lecturers might not be able to explain the subject effectively due to many factors. This research aims to justify and investigate more aspects to support the understanding of object-oriented concepts through games. Game is one of the approaches that could attract students' attention and increases their focus in learning object-oriented theory and practice. This paper reports a feasibility study using a controlled experiment that investigated the effect of using games in learning object-oriented programming among Computer Science students. The findings show that learners prefer using game as compared to traditional approach of teaching.

However, in recent years it has also evolved as a multitasking tool to promote asynchronous learning among students. Malaysia as an education hub regularly draws large numbers of foreign students to pursue transfer degree programs here. It is observed that these students from various continents of the world have different perceptions on learning due to their cultural differences. Therefore, an e-learning platform is required to facilitate asynchronous learning. This paper explores the transfer students' usage pattern of a typical e-learning tool: Course Management Software (CMS) or commonly known as Blackboard in tertiary education. Though e-learning have provided fascinating multitasking tools, very limited attention is paid to transfer students' perceptions and the frequency of usage of the e-learning system. Therefore, a case study was conducted in an e-learning environment, on the usability of selected tools in CMS. Results of the research demonstrated that large percentage of students had very positive perceptions of certain e-learning tools and the frequency of usage of CMS is high; with vast majority of students using it frequently. Nevertheless, the findings also suggest that certain tools are redundant and do not assist in their learning process. Some implications of the findings are discussed in this paper.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1549-5; POD:978-1-4577-1548-8","10.1109/ISBEIA.2011.6088824","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088824","Blackboard;Course Management Software;asynchronous learning;e-learning","Educational institutions;Electronic learning;Multitasking;Postal services;Usability","courseware;distance learning;multiprogramming","CMS tool;asynchronous learning;course management software usage pattern;cultural difference;e-learning tool;education hub;foreign student;multitasking tool;tertiary education;transfer student","","0","","9","","","","25-28 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there are few factors such as time, safety and cost that hold certain experiments in schools from being conducted in the lab. Instruction using computer based training in education using computer supported virtual laboratory has been reported to provide many advantages over other learning techniques. In this paper, we discuss stages involved in the proposed conceptual framework as a guide to develop virtual laboratory for biology (VLab-Bio) which is divided into three phases namely: identifying research problem, design and develop VLab-Bio prototype and usability testing of the prototype. In the first phase we reported results of a preliminary study which shows that “Describe the application of knowledge on mitosis in cloning” is the learning objective to be focused as a content in VLab-Bio.

In this study we will discuss the reliability, validity and philosophical aspects of the Delphi method, first with a small literature review and then by representing two different surveys conducted using the Delphi method. The point of view in our report is the usability of Delphi in collecting qualitative data for software engineering research. The most significant features of the Delphi method are its recursion and the possibility to get immediate feedback and evaluate one's own answer. Although there are many forms of Delphi techniques, these features exist in one form or the other in all Delphi variations. In Delphi-based surveys, the minimum number of participants is smaller and participants are not selected at random but because of their particular expertise. Among the traditional research methods this is seen to cause the risk of bias and endangering both reliability and validity. In the Delphi method, the recursion produced by three or more rounds, the expertise and - in most cases - anonymity of participants, and the opportunity to evaluate and argue one's own answer after having seen the other opinions and arguments are thought to guarantee the quality of well-planned and well-conducted research.","2159-5100;21595100","Electronic:978-1-890843-23-6; POD:978-1-4577-1552-5; USB:978-1-890843-24-3","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6017716","","Business;Cultural differences;Education;Instruments;Reliability theory;Sampling methods","philosophical aspects;social aspects of automation;software reliability","Delphi method;Delphi techniques;Delphi-based surveys;philosophical aspect;reliability aspect;software engineering research;validity aspect","","1","","26","","","","July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The deep gap between simulation world of controlled system and practical implementation in e.g. embedded hardware can be bridged through the use of special hardware and software directly in MATLAB/Simulink environment. This paper presents the review of available tools with respect to their usability, sampling rate capability, the necessary software needs and also the financial requirements. Most of approaches require the C code generation using Real-Time Workshop. However e.g. the Real-Time Toolbox works directly with normal mode of Simulink which can be especially recommended for the educational applications. The paper briefly describes several case studies where undergraduate students can deal with real educational models without previous knowledge of the real-time systems. The list of available hardware and software tools is not complete but includes all important approaches: low cost general purpose I/O card with/without C code generation, high-performance hardware for comfort rapid prototyping or hardware-in-the-loop simulation and code generation for embedded targets (16 or 32bit microcontrollers or DSP).","","Electronic:978-1-61284-985-0; POD:978-1-61284-982-9","10.1109/ICMECH.2011.5971238","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5971238","","Electronic mail;MATLAB;Mathematical model;Mobile communication;Read only memory;Rotors","control engineering computing;digital signal processing chips;engineering education;mechatronics;microcontrollers;program compilers;rapid prototyping (industrial);real-time systems","16-bit microcontroller;32-bit microcontroller;C code generation;Matlab;Simulink;digital signal processor;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;mechatronic education;mechatronic practice;mechatronic research;rapid prototyping;realtime control prototyping;realtime workshop","","10","","16","","","","13-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Requirement analysis and multimedia interactive courseware testing involved teachers and preschoolers from National Child Development Research Centre (NCDRC), Sultan Idris Education University, Perak, Malaysia. This courseware development consists of many crucial decision-making stages such as analysis, design, development, implementation and evaluation (ADDIE model). Within analyzing phase, the instructional problem is clarified, the goals and objectives are established, and the learning environment and learner characteristics are identified. Design phase is a phase where instructional strategies are designed and media choices are made. In the developmental phase, materials are produced according to decision making in design phase. The implementation phase included testing of prototypes (with targeted audience) and putting the product in full production. Formative evaluation is presented in each stage whilst summative evaluation covers criterion-related reference items test and providing opportunities for user's feedback. Final study on PMICMO's content understanding and usability towards 15 NCDRC, UPSI preschoolers (Malay)and 10 preschoolers (non-Malay) around Tanjong Malim district in Perak, Malaysia indicate that all 100% preschoolers simply understand the content being disseminated. All 100% NCDRC preschoolers understand the Malay language being used in PMICMO and about 70% non-Malay preschoolers can also understood it well. Every directive instruction on PMICMO was read to 30% non-Malay preschoolers before they start to use it. For usability, it showed that 100% NCDRC preschoolers successfully used PMICMO without any difficulties and 70% of non-Malay preschoolers can operate PMICMO without any problems. The - - rest (30%) were aided by researcher during the early stage of using mouse. Findings from PMICMO testing indicated that 100% preschoolers are well-satisfied with this courseware and gain fast understanding on a given topic.

The concept of quality is consisting of many criteria: quality of service perspective, a user perspective, a content perspective or indeed a usability perspective. This research conducts some tests to measure the quality of Malaysian University website via web diagnostic tools online. We propose a methodology for determining and evaluating the best Malaysian university website based on many criteria of website quality, consists of Linear Weightage Model, Analytical Hierarchy Process, Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process, and one new hybrid model. This new hybrid model has been implemented using Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and linear weightage model to generate the weights for the criteria which are much better and guarantee more fairly preference of criteria. The result of this study confirmed most of Malaysian University websites are neglecting the performance and quality criteria. By applying Hybrid model between FAHP and LWM approach for website evaluation has resulted in significant acceleration of implementation, raised the overall effectiveness with respect to the underlying methodology and ultimately enabled more efficient and significantly equal or better procedure compared with other methods.","2155-8973;21558973","Electronic:978-1-4244-6718-1; POD:978-1-4244-6715-0","10.1109/ITSIM.2010.5561363","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5561363","Hybrid model;Performance;University website;quality;web diagnostic","Decision making;HTML;Servers;Software;Testing;Time factors;Web sites","Web sites;computer aided instruction;fuzzy set theory;software quality","FAHP;LWM;Malaysian University Web site;Web diagnostic tools;Web site quality;content perspective;fuzzy analytical hierarchy process;linear weightage model;quality of service;usability perspective;user perspective","","2","","24","","","","15-17 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This study analyzed misunderstandings in the teaching of landscape design, and the application of sketchup in landscape design in the light of its specific use. The results showed that sketchup software is remarkable in six aspects, which are design concept, space design, global design, real-time rendering, usability, and data interchange. Sketchup has a bright prospect of application in the teaching of landscape design due to its focus on landscape design process and its good usability. Therefore, it is essential to offer sketchup courses in the major of landscape design and relevant majors in universities. The application of sketchup in landscape design courses can lead designers back to the traditional working style of coherent design and presentation, instead of merely focusing on design results, so as to effectively improve the efficiency of landscape design teaching.","2158-7434;21587434","Electronic:978-1-4244-5235-4; POD:978-1-4244-5234-7","10.1109/OPEE.2010.5507971","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5507971","application;landscape design;sketchup;teaching","Application software;Art;Design automation;Education;Educational institutions;Optical design;Photonics;Process design;Software design;Usability","computer aided instruction;educational institutions;rendering (computer graphics)","3DMAX aplication;CAD application;Potoshop application;data interchange aspect;design concept aspect;global design aspect;landscape design teaching;realtime rendering aspect;sketchup software;space design aspect;undergraduate college;usability aspect","","1","","10","","","","10-11 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

More recently, upon formation of a new undergraduate degree in Informatics, this course was transformed into a three-quarter capstone course taken by students in their final year. Correspondingly, some aspects of the course projects, such as the business scope and software complexity, grew in proportion to the increase in the project duration. At the same time, a number of Â¿costsÂ¿ were reduced, including the time and effort required to set up the development infrastructure and development environments, and learn new tools and languages. Most importantly, several other factors experienced substantial growth. The longer project duration allowed significant increase in the effort and attention paid to usability engineering and user-centered design, leading to systems that were deployable and more usable for the target users. It also enabled better software testing, deployment and release management. As a result, the final outcome was much closer to production quality than the prototypes and proof-of-concept systems typical of earlier single-quarter projects.","1093-0175;10930175","DVD:978-1-4244-7051-8; Electronic:978-1-4244-7053-2; POD:978-1-4244-7052-5","10.1109/CSEET.2010.41","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5463591","","Business communication;Design engineering;Informatics;Production systems;Software design;Software engineering;Software prototyping;Software testing;Usability;User centered design","computer science education;educational courses;program testing;software engineering;user centred design","business scope;capstone project;development environment;development infrastructure;informatics;production quality;project duration;single-quarter project course;software complexity;software deployment;software design;software development;software engineering;software release management;software testing;undergraduate degree;usability engineering;user centered design","","4","","8","","","","9-12 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A mobile learning application for the young ones should be designed and developed with respect to their technological skill, learning capability and language proficiency. This paper discusses the heuristic evaluation of a mobile learning prototype for children aged between 10 and 12 years old. It was developed using JCreator LE and Sun Wireless Toolkit 2.5.2 platform software. The prototype consists of learning material from the Science subject that is taught in all primary schools in Malaysia. It focuses on a subtopic relating to Basic Needs of Human. The researchers envisioned that such application can be used as a revision aid that will complement the use of textbooks and workbooks in the classroom learning. The first prototype was evaluated using heuristic evaluation technique with five software ergonomic experts. The evaluation revealed few design issues that should be refined in order to improve its usability before testing it on the real users, the children. It is hoped that the mobile learning prototype will boost the interest of Malaysian children to learn Science at their own pace, regardless of time and location.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6080-9; POD:978-1-4244-6079-3","10.1109/ICCEA.2010.248","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5445700","children;heuristic evaluation;mobile learning;software ergonomic expert","Aging;Application software;Education;Educational institutions;Ergonomics;Humans;Prototypes;Software prototyping;Software tools;Sun","computer aided instruction;human factors;mobile computing","JCreator LE software;Sun Wireless Toolkit 2.5.2 platform software;heuristic evaluation technique;language proficiency;learning capability;mobile learning application;mobile learning prototype;primary school children;science subject;software ergonomic experts","","2","","9","","","","19-21 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, realistic VR surgery simulations are in high demand as a result of offering risk-free training environments for physicians. The necessity of realism compels researchers to adopt physics-based models and haptic renderings that place extra computation burdens on real-time rendering pipelines. In this study, we investigate the usability of already built-in physics-based models in physics/or game engine PhysX library, for scooping operations in artificial cervical disc replacement (ACDR) surgery. The motivation behind our work is twofold. First, intricacies involved in ACDR surgery are introduced and the fundamental components towards the development of a surgical simulator are addressed. Second, an on-going framework development is introduced for the scooping action based on the PhysX library which provides optimized and physics-based methods for a plausible simulation.

We present the preliminary findings of 2 user studies of 21 graduate students who engaged in SNA using NodeXL. The majority of students, while information professionals, had little technical background or experience with SNA techniques. Six of the participants had more technical backgrounds and were chosen specifically for their experience with graph drawing and information visualization. Our primary objectives were (1) to evaluate NodeXL as an SNA tool for a broad base of users and (2) to explore methods for teaching SNA. Our complementary dual case-study format demonstrates the usability of NodeXL for a diverse set of users, and significantly, the power of a tightly integrated metrics/visualization tool to spark insight and facilitate sense-making for students of SNA.","","POD:978-1-4244-5334-4","10.1109/CSE.2009.120","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5284040","MILC;NodeXL;SNA;Social Network Analysis;graph drawing;information visualization;multi-dimensional in-depth long-term case studies;netviz nirvana;teaching;visual analytics","Computer science;Data visualization;Educational institutions;Information services;Internet;Libraries;Open source software;Programming profession;Social network services;Web sites","computer science education;data visualisation;social networking (online);spreadsheet programs","Microsoft Excel open-source template;Netviz Nirvana;NodeXL;graph layout algorithm;social network analysis;structural relationship;visualization tool","","10","","28","","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The e-learning softwares that is commercially available has been developed mainly to satisfy the needs of the industry, whose goal is the fast acquisition of competences. On the other hand, universities deals with learning processes that develop themselves on a medium or a long term period, and their main idea is to help students to develop a cognitive representation of those sectors in which they are expected to operate. This is just one of the reasons that induced us to develop our own e-learning systems using learning objects. This paper discusses the analysis, design and evaluation of school_eLean an interactive e-learning tool. It covers the performance and evaluation details of usability, designing the evaluation, the objectives and respondents, the study, the questionnaires questions asked and basic assumptions, what needed to be evaluated, the execution of the evaluation, its results and conclusions. The evaluation results indicated that the e-learn system produced more rehearsal from students than the traditional teaching and improved their marks. It was easier and more interesting to use with greater facilities to research and rehearse knowledge. There was a general belief in the bended approach that e-learn system, that it did indeed assist knowledge retention, this in itself is an important factor for the students' psyche. As compared with the neutral system the interactive system held interest longer and was more capable of interacting at the student's own level.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-3595-1; POD:978-1-4244-3594-4","10.1109/ICCCNET.2008.4787694","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4787694","","Application software;Computer industry;Education;Educational institutions;Electronic learning;Interactive systems;Psychology;Software systems;Usability;Virtual private networks","computer aided instruction;virtual private networks","cognitive representation;computer based tutoring system;e-learning softwares;interactive system;knowledge retention;reusable learning objects;virtual private networks","","0","","7","","","","18-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An industrial psychology literature, apart from computing, has sometimes addressed questions of this kind. But this kind of study must become part of programming language theory within computing. It's the importance of just these kinds of questions that makes programmers choose scripting languages.

We believe one way to boost the utility of such simulations and animations is to make them easier to use. In this paper, we describe a pen-based interface for constructing weighted and unweighted graphs which functions as a front-end to shortest path and minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm simulators that we have developed. We compare the usability of this pen-based interface to that of a WIMP-based interface and a hybrid interface that uses a mixture of pen-based and WIMP-based input methods. We report evaluation results on the usability of the three types of interfaces that we have developed. Our results show that a purely pen-based approach to graph creation may actually suffer from the relatively higher misrecognition rates of the harder-to-recognize symbols and inhibit usability. We conclude that a hybrid approach which combines a soft-keyboard with graph recognition outperforms interfaces that are purely pen-based or WIMP-based.","","POD:0-7695-2942-9","10.1109/PLT.2007.2","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4488860","","Animation;Application software;Computational modeling;Computer science education;Computer simulation;Ink;Laboratories;Tree graphs;Usability;Web search","computer animation;graphical user interfaces;handwritten character recognition;human computer interaction;keyboards;light pens;trees (mathematics)","WIMP-based PowerPoint-like interface;computer animation;computer simulation;free-hand graph drawing recognizer;graph creation;minimum spanning tree algorithm simulator;pen-based interface usability;shortest path algorithm simulator;soft-keyboard","","0","","5","","","","4-5 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We describe the activities that were developed and fielded in two different UE courses, and two collaborative tools created to support these activities - a collaborative case browser and a collaborative case builder. Students were positive about both types of collaborative activities and offered suggestions for how to enhance effectiveness in the future.","1530-1605;15301605","978-0-7695-3075-897807695307","10.1109/HICSS.2008.417","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4438710","","Collaborative tools;Collaborative work;Cultural differences;Education;Educational institutions;Educational technology;International collaboration;Organisms;Software libraries;Usability","computer science education;groupware;user interfaces","case-based authentic learning activity;collaborative case builder;collaborative case commenting tool;professional education;usability engineering course","","3","","28","","","","7-10 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main research was focused towards creating an e-learning dictionary system and its assessment of e-learning effectiveness. Motivation of the research is to avoid inconsistencies and language problems regarding translation of such terms and nomenclatures in literature textbooks and articles by providing a community of experts by invitation that will create an official and standardized translations. The authenticated users with administrative privileges will add, store and change and overall manage the e-learning dictionary. The primary administrator will grant administrative or reader privileges to learners based on authentication. This kind of approach is based on wiki approach by creating a community of users where unlike the wiki approach will be carefully chosen and granted approach by invitation and privileges will be based on user data validation. The research method was exploratory research to determine the best research design and then empirical research to describe accurately the interaction between the learners and the system being observed. The data were collected through focus groups and surveys, direct or indirect discussions and in-depth communications and interviews with prospective users, as well as with literature review of the experts in the field. We have used the pedagogical re-engineering process that we consider as important to be able to compare the effective system usage with prescribed scenario. The purpose of the research realized is in order: (1) to gather information and asses e-learning interactions between human actors and the developed medium of instruction-the software solution, (2) determine the distance between learner activities and preconceived scenarios. The observed route of a learner was used to give feedback information on the e- ffective learning. This research gives valuable insight into evaluated e-learning impact of the online dictionary, practical issues and recommendations, secondly contributes in standardizing translation of Computer Science terms and nomenclature in other languages other then in English by providing an interactive interface and community willing to contribute.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0813-9; POD:978-1-4244-0812-2","10.1109/EURCON.2007.4400456","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4400456","dictionary;e-learning;effectiveness;engineering;indicators;solution","Computer science;Databases;Design methodology;Dictionaries;Electronic learning;Information management;Natural languages;Software engineering;Terminology;Usability","computer aided instruction;computer science education;software engineering","administrative privileges;computer science;computer science terms;didactical pedagogical approach;software engineering e-learning dictionary;wiki approach","","0","","8","","","","9-12 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the laboratory the students wrote only the AL component, while the instructor provided a number of ready-made different IS components. If the student didn't like the produced GUI, she could simply exchange the IS component with one that produces a GUI that is more to her liking. The exchange of an IS component is possible since all IS components employ the same abstract semantic interface, which does not specify the geometric and other properties of the GUI to be produced. Changing components is fast, as no compilation is required. The time the students saved by using ready-made IS components was invested in requirement elicitation and specifications, which had a beneficial effect on the usability of the student projects.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0859-8; POD:1-4244-0858-X","10.1109/ITRE.2006.381565","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4266326","Component;Component-Oriented Programming","Application software;Computer science;Computer science education;Costs;Graphical user interfaces;Information technology;Laboratories;Programming;Safety;Software engineering","computer based training;computer science education;graphical user interfaces","GUI;WebSI;application logic;graphical user interface;interaction style component;semantic component interfaces;semantic interface;software engineering training;student training","","0","","14","","","","16-19 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At first glance it can look like open source software development violates many, if not all, of the precepts of decades of careful research and teaching in software engineering. One could take a classic SE textbook and compare the activities elaborated and advocated in the various chapters with what is actually done in plain sight in the public logs of an OSS project in say SourceForge. For a professor of software engineering this might make for rather depressing reading. Are the principles of SE being rendered obsolete? Has OSS really discovered Brooks' silver bullet? Or is it just a flash in the pan or fool's gold? In this paper, the author mainly looks at one aspect of open source development, the 'problem' of creating usable interfaces, particularly for non-technical end-users. Any approach involves the challenge of how to coordinate distributed collaborative interface analysis and design, given that in conventional software development this is usually done in small teams and almost always face to face. Indeed all the methods in any HCI text just assume same-time same-place work and don't map to distributed work, let alone the looser mechanisms of OSS development. Instead what is needed is a form of participatory usability involving the coordination of end users and developers in a constantly evolving redesign process.","0270-5257;02705257","POD:1-59593-963-2","10.1109/ICSE.2005.1553536","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1553536","","Collaborative software;Collaborative work;Education;Gold;Open source software;Programming;Rendering (computer graphics);Silver;Software engineering;Usability","groupware;public domain software;software engineering;user interfaces","HCI;open source software development;participatory usability;software engineering","","0","","","","","","15-21 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The taught domain was two lessons concerning human-computer interaction: the first in usability engineering and the second in interface evaluation methodologies. A test session was also conducted to collect data on the assessment of the augmentation of the students' knowledge on the domain. Descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to the collected data to test the research hypotheses. The results showed that with regard to the transfer of simple information, this ""lesson sheet"" does not provide any statistically significant advantage, yet for complex information, a significant statistically improved performance was observed for the student group that used the tool.

While most software developers may have been exposed with basic concepts such as GUI design guidelines, few developers are able to understand the human/user-centered design (UCD) toolbox at a level that allows them to incorporate it into the software development lifecycle. This paper describes an approach for skilling developers and students enrolled in an engineering program in critical user-centered design techniques and tools. The proposed approach starts from the analysis of the usability and software engineer's work context, identifies critical UCD skills and then associates relevant learning resources with each of the identified skills.

In such framework, online learning is becoming an important tool to allow the flexibility and quality requested by such a kind of learning process. In the recent past, a great number of on-line platforms have been introduced on the market showing different characteristics and services. A series of features should be taken into account when one evaluates e-learning platforms, starting from the function and usability of the overall learning system in the context of the human, social and cultural organization within which it is to be used. Obviously, the analysis of the features of a system is not sufficient: it is also important to understand how they are integrated to facilitate learning and training and what principles are applied to guide the way the system is used. To evaluate them both pedagogical and technological aspects must be carefully evaluated. This paper proposes a model for describing and characterizing on-line learning platform component.

A qualitative study of algorithm learning strategies of students and a usability study of a hypermedia algorithm animation system led to the conclusion that current algorithm animations may actually do more to hinder than help undergraduates develop a solid understanding of the algorithm, because of their learning strategies. Students relied on a single representation of an algorithm, misinterpreted the limitations and specifics of that representation, avoided using outside media sources and worked primarily within groups to understand algorithms. Thus, algorithm animation may have limited usefulness for this population. Therefore, to discourage students from relying on a single representation and to encourage them to be more self-directed and engaged learners, we have students create, share and collectively interpret their own algorithm representations","","POD:0-7695-1013-2","10.1109/ICALT.2001.943871","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=943871","","Algorithm design and analysis;Animation;Computer science;Education;Robustness;Software algorithms;Software engineering;Solids;Visualization;World Wide Web","computer animation;computer science education;human factors;hypermedia;program visualisation;social aspects of automation;teaching","algorithm animation;algorithm learning strategies;algorithm representations;current algorithm animations;hypermedia algorithm animation system;learning strategies;outside media sources;qualitative study;self-directed learners;teaching;undergraduate computer science students;undergraduate student learning strategy;usability study","","1","","4","","","","2001","06 Aug 2001-08 Aug 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The need to incorporate human-computer interaction (HCI) and especially `usability', into software design and system development is increasingly evident. If industry is to pay more attention to improving the usability of its software and systems, courses need to be established so that students gain knowledge and skills that are important in the real-world and experience realistic situations that address usability issues. To date, the provision of HCI education for practitioners has not been addressed substantively by most Australian universities. The paper describes the course that responds to industry needs. It reviews the course objectives, content resources and some teaching strategies. It also provides insights into problems of conducting courses relating to industry needs and plans for future development of the academic programme","","POD:0-8186-7525-X","10.1109/OZCHI.1996.560002","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=560002","","Application software;Australia;Computer aided software engineering;Handheld computers;Human computer interaction;Process design;Programming;Software systems;Software tools;Usability","business data processing;computer science education;educational courses;human factors;software engineering;teaching;user interfaces","Australian universities;academic response;case study;competitive edge;educational courses;future development;human computer interaction education;human-computer interaction;industry needs;information technology;marketplace;organisations;software design;system development;teaching strategies;usability;user interfaces","","0","","3","","","","24-27 Nov 1996","24 Nov 1996-27 Nov 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The four classes of knowledge-based software to be considered-agents, browsers, indexes (ontologies), and user models-are assessed by applying basic concepts from pragmatics to identify critical issues of context, meaning and location that affect usability and utility. This paper considers issues of common interest to software developers and practicing linguists or ethnographers, such as (a) feature density and preference determination in user modeling; (b) contextualization in high-performance and iterative DB queries; (c) social agency as related to such programming languages as KQML; and (d) disambiguation of meaning with natural language ontologies in large corpora. Three points are asserted and defended: first, current interfaces, databases, and query software have not achieved their full potential for capturing and storing information, and rendering it useful for practical tasks. Second, this failing originates in a reductionist view of language. A richer, context-bound analytical framework is required, such as that offered by pragmatics. Third, combined with the practical methods of ethnography and discourse analysis, a pragmatics-based perspective can support creation of the next generation of computer interfaces and databases, as well as advanced search and navigation tools","","POD:0-7803-6442-2","10.1109/EMS.2000.872580","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=872580","","Application software;Computer languages;Context modeling;Knowledge management;Law;Legal factors;Medical services;Natural languages;Ontologies;Usability","database management systems;information analysis;information needs;information retrieval;knowledge engineering;linguistics;software engineering","KQML;agents;browsers;computer interfaces;context;contextualization;databases;disambiguation of meaning;discourse analysis;education;ethnographers;feature density;functional linguistics;health care;high-performance;indexes;information capture;information storage;iterative DB queries;knowledge management;knowledge-based software;legal services;location;meaning;natural language ontologies;navigation tools;ontologies;pragmatics;preference determination;professional disciplines;professional services;programming languages;query software;search tools;social agency;software developers;software engineering;user modeling;user models","","0","","9","","","","2000","13 Aug 2000-15 Aug 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper shows the results of an analysis carried out in a controlled environment on 36 student project teams over 3 years. In each year, each team was charged with implementing the same project with the same resources, and the same access to the client, on the same technical platform. This enabled an observation of the contribution of factors like total time spent, proportion of time spent on analysis and design, quality of project management, quality of team involvement processes deployed and use of a methodology on the quality of the final product.

To help manage this complexity, models can be used to highlight the significant elements and attributes of a system, and summarise key processes in its operation and evolution. The purpose of the paper is to present a set of such models for debate. Most of these are at the highest levels of system description and are therefore generally applicable across a range of development techniques. Consequently they provide a framework within which specific system development techniques can be described and assessed. The models are discussed with respect to an experimental methodology, BASE, being developed at the University of Ulster. Two significant aspects of this approach are: (i) placing the production or enhancement of computing systems in the context of `business improvement'; and (ii) emphasising the need to make change with respect to a `vision' of where improvement is leading. The business analysis part of BASE is built on Soft Systems Methodology.

Architects' education revolves around the studio course, which promotes: project based work on complex and open ended problems; very rapid iteration of design solutions; frequent formal and informal critique; consideration of heterogeneous issues; the use of precedent and thinking about the whole; the creative use of constraints; and the central importance of design media. M. Kapor (1991) suggested that software practitioners needed to “rethink the fundamentals of how software is made” and proposed the architect's role in building design as a fruitful analogy for software professionals seeking to reform software practice. This analogy helps us focus on usefulness, usability, user needs and practices, and other technical and nontechnical aspects of good software design. It highlights concerns about people's lives and work practices and how people “inhabit” systems.
