"Fake or Real? Analysis of Physical Phenomena in Viral Videos as an Inquiry Learning Activity","S. Manske; H. U.

Online laboratories overcome a variety of deficits and obstacles that complicate in situ experiments, particularly regarding accessibility, availability, financial costs and preparation time. However, such a computer-supported learning approach still demands for motivating and playful scenarios to catch and engage students with a lower affinity to sciences. This gap is closed by ""Fake or Real""-scenarios, in which students verify or falsify the authenticity of viral videos from the internet. We developed a web-based online lab along with inquiry-based learning scenarios for the (interactive) analysis of such videos by extracting physical parameters according to corresponding hypotheses. The work has been evaluated in a classroom experiment including 17 high school students in an interdisciplinary lesson.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-3870-5; POD:978-1-5386-3871-2","10.1109/ICALT.2017.128","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8001795","Inquiry-based learning;STEM;video laboratory;viral videos","Gender issues;Laboratories;Physics education;Tools;Videos","Internet;computer aided instruction;laboratories","Web-based online lab;classroom experiment;computer-supported learning approach;fake-or-real scenarios;inquiry learning activity;interdisciplinary lesson;physical phenomena analysis;science education;student engagement;viral videos","","","","","","","","3-7 July 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While ECS has been well-received by its students and successful in reaching many students of diverse backgrounds, it currently suffers from a final module which is expensive and offers no easy transition to text-based programming. This module, which teaches robotics as an application of computing, rests on the LEGO Mindstorms1 platform. The Mindstorms have a block-based programming language that abstracts too much code to be of any use for making a transition from block-based programming to text-based programming. They are also more expensive than most schools can afford. This paper reports on one aspect of our successful effort to create an alternative curriculum which meets the same curriculum objectives as the current sixth module, but for a reduced price.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8367-7; POD:978-1-4673-8368-4","10.1109/BLOCKS.2015.7369021","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7369021","Arduino;Computer Science;ECS;block-based programming;paper","Computer languages;Hardware;Keyboards;Programming profession;Visualization","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational institutions;embedded systems;object-oriented languages;object-oriented programming","ECS;LEGO Mindstorm;MUzECS;block-based programming language;embedded block;exploring computer science education;schools;text-based programming","","","","7","","","","22-22 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However most of the initiatives designed to get students interested in STEM fields are constrained by floor space, budget, or driving distance. These factors, in combination, act to limit the affordability and accessibility of research opportunities in STEM fields to students in schools faced with increasingly limited budgets or lacking access to experienced STEM teachers. Since a trained STEM workforce is crucial to tackling research challenges of importance to the Air Force and the nation, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Discovery Lab program has developed a Virtual Reality Academy (VRA) program utilizing open source virtual reality software, Open Simulator, to create a virtual collaboration environment called Virtual (reality) Discovery Center (VDC). This 16-region VDC is the key to the Discovery Lab's 1,000 Student Outreach initiative designed to greatly expand the Discovery Lab's ability to make project-based “hands-on” research experience accessible to students across the country via the Open Simulator collaboration technologies. This paper highlights many of the successful efforts to establish VDC Virtual Learning Academies in areas such as Biology, Nanotechnology, Computer Vision, and Mobile Computing (smartphone apps). This paper is not a scientific study of Open Simulator as a collaboration tool for STEM but rather a descriptive overview of its successful implementation locally and nationally - suggesting its potential as a game-changer in STEM education and research.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6404-1; POD:978-1-4673-6403-4","10.1109/CTS.2013.6567288","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567288","","Avatars;Collaboration;Dinosaurs;Educational institutions;Solid modeling;Space shuttles","computer aided instruction;engineering education;groupware;public domain software;teaching;virtual reality","16-region VDC;Air Force Research Laboratory Discovery Lab program;Open Simulator collaboration technologies;STEM collaboration;STEM fields;STEM teachers;STEM workforce;VRA program;Virtual Discovery Center;Virtual Reality Academy program;driving distance;floor space;open source virtual reality software;project-based hands-on research experience;science-technology-engineering-mathematics;virtual collaboration environment;virtual learning academies","","1","","6","","","","20-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The increasing use of e-learning means higher education must move to multi-modal user interfaces in order to make e-learning materials accessible to all students. E-Learning materials (particularly in the sciences and technology) are predominantly visual, presented via computer keyboard and screen. Software and devices designed to aid the vision impaired are unable to decipher most images and visual- centric objects contained in e-learning materials. This paper discusses a project undertaken over the past two years to modify the content and presentation of Cisco certification e-learning courses to enable accessibility by vision impaired and blind students. These modifications necessitated rewriting the learning materials so they could be effectively presented via multi-modal user interfaces to vision impaired students, involving speech, audio, haptics and force-feed devices and methods. Evaluation of sections of the project by the vision impaired students using a model based upon Stufflebeam's CIPP model and Kirkpatrick's Four-Level training program evaluation model has been carried out and the results are presented.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0406-1; POD:1-4244-0405-3","10.1109/ITHET.2006.339759","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141622","educational technology;handicapped aids;information technology;user interface human factors","Computer science education;Computer vision;Educational programs;Electronic learning;Face detection;Graphics;Keyboards;Materials science and technology;Software design;User interfaces","computer aided instruction;educational courses;further education;handicapped aids;haptic interfaces","Cisco certification e-learning courses;Stufflebeam CIPP model;e-learning materials;force-feed devices;haptic devices;higher education;multi modal user interfaces;vision impaired students","","0","","13","","","","10-13 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, the articulation and verification of software system requirements remains one of the most difficult and error-prone tasks in the software development lifecycle. The use of formal methods, based on mathematical logic and discrete mathematics, holds promise for improving the reliability of requirements articulation and modeling. However, formal modeling and reasoning about requirements has not typically been a part of the software analyst's education and training, and because the learning curve for the use of these methods is nontrivial, adoption of formal methods has proceeded slowly. As a consequence, technology transfer is a significant issue in the use of formal methods. In this paper, several efforts undertaken at NASA aimed at increasing the accessibility of formal methods are described. These include the production of the following: two NASA guidebooks on the concepts and applications of formal methods, a body of case studies in the application of formal methods to the specification of requirements for actual NASA projects, and course materials for a professional development course introducing formal methods and their application to the analysis and design of software-intensive systems. In addition, efforts undertaken at two universities to integrate instruction on formal methods based on these NASA materials into the computer science and software engineering curricula are described.","1093-0175;10930175","POD:0-7695-0421-3","10.1109/CSEE.2000.827014","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=827014","","Application software;Educational institutions;Logic;Mathematical model;Mathematics;NASA;Production systems;Programming;Software systems;Technology transfer","aerospace computing;aerospace industry;computer science education;educational courses;formal specification;technology transfer;training","NASA;aerospace industry;case studies;computer science education;discrete mathematics;formal methods;high-quality software;mathematical logic;professional development course;requirements specifications;requirements verification;technology transfer;training","","3","","24","","","","6-8 March 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics are emerging fields of research that aim to enhance the delivery of education through the application of various statistical and machine learning approaches. An extensive literature survey indicates that no significant research is available within the area of MOOC data analysis, in particular considering the behavioural patterns of users. In this paper, therefore, two sets of features, based on learner behavioural patterns, were compared in terms of their suitability for predicting the course outcome of learners participating in MOOCs. Our Exploratory Data Analysis demonstrates that there is strong correlation between click stream actions and successful learner outcomes. Various Machine Learning algorithms have been applied to enhance the accuracy of classifier models. Simulation results from our investigation have shown that Random Forest achieved viable performance for our prediction problem, obtaining the highest performance of the models tested.

This paper presents an educational project that aims at creating and empirically evaluating virtual reality (VR) experiences for the geosciences: an interactive volcano experience based on LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) and image data of Iceland's Thrihnukar volcano. This work-in-progress prototype addresses the lack of content and tools for immersive virtual reality (iVR) in geoscientific education and research and how to make it easier to integrate iVR into classroom experiences. It makes use of environmentally sensed data such that interaction and linked content can be integrated into a single experience. We discuss our workflows as well as methods and authoring tools for iVR analysis and creation of virtual educational experiences. These methods and tools aim to enhance the utility of geospatial data from repositories such as OpenTopography.org through unlocking treasure-troves of geospatial data for VR applications.

Another continuing challenge is the low level of participation of women and other groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines. As a partial remedy for these issues, we established a Virtual Engineering Sciences Learning Lab (VESLL) that provides interactive objects and learning activities, multimedia displays, and instant feedback procedures in a virtual environment to guide students through a series of key quantitative skills and concepts. Developed in the online virtual world Second Life™, VESLL is an interactive environment that supports STEM education, with potential to help reach women and other underrepresented groups. VESLL exposes students to various quantitative skills and concepts through visualization, collaborative games, and problem solving with realistic learning activities. Initial assessments have demonstrated high student interest in VESLL's potential as a supplementary instructional tool and show that student learning experiences were improved by use of VESLL. Ultimately, the VESLL project contributes to the ongoing body of evidence suggesting that online delivery of course content has remarkable potential when properly deployed by STEM educators.","1939-1382;19391382","","10.1109/TLT.2015.2419253","Innovations in Engineering Education, Curriculum, and Infrastructure (IEECI); US National Science Foundation; 10.13039/100000001 - National Science Foundation (NSF); ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7081334","Computer science education;computer uses in education;computer-assisted instruction;multimedia information systems","Conferences;Education;Electrical engineering;Games;Logic gates;Second Life;Virtual environments","Internet;STEM;computer aided instruction;computer games;educational courses;engineering computing;engineering education;groupware;interactive systems;mathematics computing;natural sciences computing","STEM education;Second Life;VESLL;Virtual Engineering Sciences Learning Lab;collaborative games;course content online delivery;engineering education;interactive objects;learning activities;multimedia displays;online virtual world;supplementary instructional tool","","0","","26","","","20150407","Jan.-March 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Compliance with accessibility guidelines does not guarantee blind users' satisfaction when accessing websites. Meanwhile, in recent years, websites have undergone radical changes regarding design, development, and construction. Responsive design is a new trend that has a strong impact on web design. To determine blind users' experience with responsive design, the authors performed empirical tests to investigate the impact of responsive design on the emotions of blind users during web interactions. They measured user emotions by applying the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) instrument. Results show that although the responsive websites investigated had acceptable levels of accessibility, they posed numerous usability barriers and triggered intense, negative user emotions. Furthermore, the average number of negative emotional reactions for blind users was higher in the case of responsive web design than in the case of nonresponsive web design.","1070-986X;1070986X","","10.1109/MMUL.2017.21","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7924277","HCI design and evaluation methods;Internet/Web technologies;accessibility;blind user;healthcare;mobile;multimedia;software engineering;usability;user experience","Education;Guidelines;Internet and Web services;Market research;Medical services;Software engineering;Usability;Web design","Web design;handicapped aids","PANAS instrument;accessibility guidelines;blind users;positive and negative affect schedule instrument;responsive Web design","","","","","","","","Apr.-June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Correctly locating DNA-binding residues solely from protein sequences is an important but challenging task for protein function annotations and drug discovery, especially in the post-genomic era where large volumes of protein sequences have quickly accumulated. In this study, we report a new predictor, named TargetDNA, for targeting protein-DNA binding residues from primary sequences. TargetDNA uses a protein’s evolutionary information and its predicted solvent accessibility as two base features and employs a centered linear kernel alignment algorithm to learn the weights for weightedly combining the two features. Based on the weightedly combined feature, multiple initial predictors with SVM as classifiers are trained by applying a random under-sampling technique to the original dataset, the purpose of which is to cope with the severe imbalance phenomenon that exists between the number of DNA-binding and non-binding residues. The final ensembled predictor is obtained by boosting the multiple initially trained predictors. Experimental simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TargetDNA achieves a high prediction performance and outperforms many existing sequence-based protein-DNA binding residue predictors.

OER are digital contents for teaching-learning purpose available through websites, released under an open intellectual property license to allow their free use for self-learners and educators. The OER-based learning is involved in formal and non-formal education and can be included in different educational environments, including Elearning. However, despite the growing availability of OER, most of these resources are not accessible to people with disabilities. Hence, the accessibility issues need to be addressed in order to include this vulnerable group of population in OER-based learning opportunities. An accessible environment should be twofold: accessibility of resources and accessibility of OER website that offers the resources. In this paper, we propose a process to guide the creation and release of accessible educational resources and their application to a case study. This case refers the creation of an educational resource accessible for people with severe visual impairments and its release through important OER websites. This accessible resource is a full online course that includes downloadable PDF documents. Moreover, OER websites, where this resource is released, are accessible for people with disabilities. Furthermore, this paper highlights the specific considerations for visual impairments in the design of this resource, and accessibility validation tests conducted with automated tools, simulation software, and user testing. The results of this experience allow recognizing certain problems in the creation of accessible resources as well as the limitations of OER websites to serve people with disabilities.

This expansion of the use of cloud applications comes with some significant learning and adoption challenges to the end users along with the technical advantages that allow greater accessibility and ease of use. The influence of individual user perceptions toward these technologies is an issue that merits further investigation. Several technology acceptance models have demonstrated some degree of success in predicting adoption behaviors utilizing individual user traits and beliefs. However, there have been limited investigations of variables after the technology has been implemented and used. This paper focuses on the associations between variables identified in the literature that are considered to be influencing use and perceptions of technology for undergraduate students of technology at a mid-sized university in Southeast Michigan. The results statistically present significant correlations between each measured variable and support the interaction between perceived ease of use, computer anxiety, computer self-efficacy, and internet self-efficacy with the perceived usefulness of cloud applications in a higher education setting.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8297-7; POD:978-1-4673-8298-4","10.1109/CSE.2015.36","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371372","cloud computing;computer anxiety;effectiveness;higher education;self-efficacy","Biological system modeling;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Computers;Education;Information technology;Organizations","cloud computing;computer aided instruction;further education;statistical analysis","Internet self-efficacy;cloud computing effectiveness;computer anxiety;computer self-efficacy;higher education institution;perceived ease of use;statistical analysis;student perception","","1","","33","","","","21-23 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our goal was to analyze the effective role of biotechnology virtual labs in improving academic performance of students and complementing classroom education. We tested the adaptability, perceived usefulness and ease of use of biotechnology virtual labs on different user groups in sciences and engineering. This study focuses mainly on the student and teacher groups from different universities across India. Feedback data was collected via a direct approach using organized workshops conducted in the year 2014-2015. 85% of participants suggested perceived usefulness of biotechnology virtual labs helped them to improve their academic performance compared to a traditional classroom scenario. Most users indicated the learning materials provided by virtual lab system were easy to understand, thus suggesting the better adaptability of ICT-enabled techniques amongst different users. This augments the role of virtual labs for remote learners all over the world. For India, such learning methods have helped overcome limitations seen in classroom-based education such as equipment accessibility, location and other economic issues.

This work proposes a colored traveling salesman problem (CTSP) in which a city has one to multiple colors allowing any salesman with the same color to visit. It presents a decomposition approach that converts CTSP into a combination of several individual traveling salesman problems (TSPs) and one MTSP for an important class of CTSP. To solve the transformed one, this work proposes a modified greedy algorithm allowing multi-colored city assignment during city search and adopts the formerly presented simulated annealing genetic algorithm. A dual-bridge waterjet cutting example is utilized to compare the presented decomposition approach and direct one.

STEM competitions promote the entry of youth into these fields in a very effective and at the same time very entertaining way. There are striking parallels between world class sport and STEM competitions that suggest that an in depth look at world class sport might lead to more effective worldwide promotion of STEM activity. Major world class sports induce great fervor, motivation, and interest in participants and observers. The fervor is strengthened by the ability to participate in chosen sports based on three characteristics or pillars, lifetime participation, international accessibility, and availability of a great variety of stimulating sporting possibilities. By designing STEM sport competitions with these three characteristics in mind, it is suggested in this paper that the fervor of participants can be maximized in their chosen field of activity. This paper will look in detail at the parallel relation between the characteristics of highly successful world class sport such as the Olympics and the fervor building potential possible in emulating those characteristics in STEM sports or competitions in the oceanic arena by an organization such as the IEEE OES.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8736-8; POD:978-1-4799-8737-5","10.1109/OCEANS-Genova.2015.7271773","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7271773","AUV;OES;Olympic;ROV;STEM;competition;education;marine robotics;sport","Australia;Buildings;Education;Organizations;Robots;Sea surface;Vehicles","STEM;oceanographic techniques;reliability","IEEE Oceanic Engineering Society;OES;availability;oceanic STEM sport competition;science technology engineering and mathematics","","","","5","","","","18-21 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These electronic resources (e-resources) have enhanced information retrieval and improved accessibility of quality academic materials. As a result, academic institutions such as universities have invested vast amounts of money to make the best use of these e-resources. Notwithstanding these efforts, research shows that, students have made little effort to utilize these resources. The objective of this study therefore, was to identify factors that influence the use of e-resources in higher institutions of learning. Based on the literature, a conceptual framework was developed from the identified factors that were considered to be influencing the use of e-resources. Data was collected using a close-ended questionnaire from learners at different levels of study at Tshwane University of Technology, South Africa. The collected data was analyzed quantitatively and results indicated that; awareness, training programs, reliability of network connections and low bandwidth are critical to the use of e-resources. The developed framework is expected to be used by other researchers while extending research addressing technology usage. Further still, institutions of learning would consider the designed framework to readdress factors that are essential for the use of technology in their settings.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6600-4; POD:978-1-4799-6601-1; USB:978-1-4799-6599-1","10.1109/ICCSE.2015.7250253","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7250253","Electronic resources;Information Systems;Information Technology usage;Online Library resources","Complexity theory;Computers;Libraries;Reliability;System performance;Training","information resources;libraries","South African higher institutions;Tshwane University of Technology;academic resources;e-resources usage;electronic form;information retrieval;quality academic materials","","0","","18","","","","22-24 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The work described in this paper aimed to validate the Dyslexia Adaptive E-Learning (DAEL) framework as an effective tool for meeting the needs of students with dyslexia. A quality assessment approach was employed to examine the extent to which DAEL can meet the minimum standards and deliver improvements in the quality of the learning experiences that are delivered to dyslexic students via e-learning technologies. The validation results outlined in this study are reported according to data collected from an original survey that involved 149 dyslexic individuals and field experts who have experience with web-based learning management systems. The results were compared with existing literature to identify trends and validate the conclusions.

A form of its implementation is the use of e-learning. However, in practice there are still some obstacles, such as learning resources are not evenly distributed, limited access to services provided, qualified educators resources are concentrated in specific areas. This led to the emergence of disparities educational process, and technology gap due to differences in ICT infrastructure owned by any educational institution. Therefore this study proposes architecture of cloud-based open learning to solve these problems. The term open learning is used in order to encouraging the development of the concept of Indonesia Open Educational Resources (IOER) and as well as the adoption of concept of cloud computing. There are several phase that we conducted in this research such as analysis, design, implementation, testing, and evaluation phase. The design of the proposed architecture consists of six layers: (1) Infrastructure, (2) Platform, (3) Application, (4) Service, (5) Access, (6) User. As a result of the implementation from this architecture is a prototype of Indonesia - Virtual Open Learning System (iVOLS). In experiment, personalization e-learning runs as a service that need large storage and other shared facilities to conduct the program so the system can delivered different learning materials to different learners. The e-learning personalization in cloud environment classified successful if the learners got the best performance on learning and it shown by their evaluation score. Based on the test results and evaluation showed that the availability on Cloud-Based Open Learning further meet user needs. This is indicated by the presence of a simple infrastructure services, application services with just one stage and the availability of a wider range of data and the resource sharing.

This educational paradigm is of paramount importance for society nowadays, because expands access opportunities to education at all levels. These learning environments can take advantage of Open Educational Resources. Using OER is a growing trend and it is turning into a recommendation by some governments and international education forums. Nevertheless, in spite of the availability of OER websites, quite a few of them do not consider accessibility design principles, therefore these websites present access barriers for users with disabilities. Besides, only a reduce number of these websites offer accessible resources, i.e. digital contents suitable for users with disabilities. On the other hand, in web environment, findability is a design consideration that improves the user's searchable experience by simplifying the location and acquisition of elements in websites. In this restricted scenario, findability of educational resources is a key issue for users with disabilities. In this research, we address the issue of findability of Open Educational Resources (OER), from the perspective of inclusive participation of users with disabilities, by considering three aspects: web accessibility, some usability best practices oriented to users with disabilities and Information Architecture. The evaluation is performed in some important and well known OER websites.","","Electronic:978-3-9075-8913-7; POD:978-1-4799-9909-5","10.1109/ICEDEG.2015.7114457","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7114457","Information Architecture;Open Educational Resources;e-Education;findability;usability;web accessibility","Education;Guidelines;Information architecture;Navigation;Organizations;Standards;Usability","Web sites;computer aided instruction;groupware;handicapped aids;human computer interaction;user interfaces","OER Websites;Web accessibility;Web environment;digital contents;e-education;educational collaborative environments;educational paradigm;element acquisition;element location;findability evaluation;information architecture;international education forums;open educational resources;usability best practices;users-with-disabilities perspective","","3","","36","","","","8-10 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are limitations with the existing foreign VP systems which make them unsuitable for training indigenous Nigerian medical students. In this study, an Aboriginal Virtual Patient (AVP) system was developed to train medical students. In order to ascertain the feasibility of this research, we validated the effectiveness of aboriginal virtual patient cases over life patient cases, the following metrics were used: accessibility, privacy, accuracy, security, availability and skill-acquired. Questionnaire, developed based on these metrics, was used to interview 80 medical students and 30 doctors from Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso. A common generic web-based architecture was then developed for the creation, management and evaluation of web-based aboriginal virtual patient cases. In order to evaluate the performance of the developed Web AVP system over existing foreign Web-based VP system, the following performance measures were used: privacy, security, accessibility, user-friendliness, ease of use and efficiency. Forty five (45) medical students and 25 doctors from LAUTECH, Ogbomoso tested the developed Web AVP system and an existing Web-based VP (called Web SP). Results of the initial feasibility study show that medical learners and trainers considered VP more effective in acquiring clinical skills in all the measures used except for accuracy where real patients have higher rating than VP. Furthermore, the developed Web AVP system has higher performance when compared to Web SP in training Nigerian medical students. The developed system was found to be more suitable for training and assessing medical students; which can eliminate challenges that could arise from using foreign VP systems.","2326-9413;23269413","DVD:978-1-4799-4999-1; Electronic:978-1-4799-4998-4; POD:978-1-4799-4997-7","10.1109/ICASTECH.2014.7068107","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7068107","Aboriginal patients;Medical training;Virtual patients;Web applications","Accuracy;Medical diagnostic imaging;Medical services;Privacy;Security;Training","Internet;computer based training;educational courses;educational institutions;medical computing;medicine;virtual reality","AVP system;LAUTECH;Ladoke Akintola University of Technology;Nigerian medical student training;Web based aboriginal virtual patient system;interactive computer simulation","","0","","20","","","","29-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, many computer games present unnecessary barriers to players with sensory, motor and cognitive impairments. In order to overcome such pitfalls, an awareness of their impact and a willingness to apply inclusive design practice is often necessary. The Global Game Jam offers a potential avenue to promote inclusive design practices to students of game development. As such, this paper evaluates the impact of an initiative to promote inclusive design practices during the 2014 Global Game Jam. An attitude questionnaire was distributed to both participants and non-participants at one event venue. The results indicate that, having enrolled in the initiative, students' attitudes improved. Furthermore, all attendees reported they were likely to pursue further learning opportunities and consider accessibility issues in their future games. This suggests that the Global Game Jam, and other similar events, present an attractive avenue to promote inclusive design practice within the context of digital game development. However, further analysis of submitted games, additional qualitative inquiry and a large-scale trial are needed to determine impact on practice and to form recommendations for future events.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4799-3922-0; POD:978-1-4799-3923-7; USB:978-1-4799-3921-3","10.1109/FIE.2014.7044162","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044162","accessibility;education;games;global game jam;hackathon;inclusive design","Computer science;Computers;Educational institutions;Entertainment industry;Games;Sociology","computer games;design","2014 Global Game Jam;computer game;digital game development;inclusive design practice;qualitative inquiry;student attitude","","1","","17","","","","22-25 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This vast infrastructural upgrade and operational change involves integration of a variety of advanced digital computing, communications and industrial control technologies. This brings new capabilities, but also necessitates a re-education of the aging workforce and training of the emerging workforce. While training does exist, the training approach and the accessibility of that training is often at odds with the needs of the utilities. To support this education and training need, in this paper we introduce the beginning of a modular, hands-on and open Smart Grid cybersecurity educational training platform and supporting materials together with an assessment of a preliminary version leveraged at the Trustworthy Cyber Infrastructure for the Power Grid (TCIPG) Summer School held in 2013. We base pedagogical pillars onto: (1) Active Learning that promotes analysis, synthesis, and evaluation of the content from Bloom's taxonomy, (2) The theory of project-based learning, (3) Piaget's learn-by-doing posture, and (4) Constructivist perspective of education. The main goal of this effort is to develop a complete, phased, and modular learning platform to provide the essential base knowledge and hands-on training exercises for understanding and demonstrating competency in Smart Grid cybersecurity.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4799-3922-0; POD:978-1-4799-3923-7; USB:978-1-4799-3921-3","10.1109/FIE.2014.7044273","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044273","","Computer security;Educational institutions;Materials;Smart grids;Training","computer aided instruction;power engineering education;security of data;smart power grids;trusted computing","Bloom taxonomy;Piaget learn-by-doing posture;TCIPG Summer School;Trustworthy Cyber Infrastructure for the Power Grid;active learning;advanced digital computing;hands-on training exercises;industrial control technologies;infrastructural upgrade;modular learning platform;open smart grid cybersecurity educational training platform;operational change;over-a-century-old power grid;project-based learning;smart grid cybersecurity education platform;transformational process","","2","","40","","","","22-25 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The fulfillment of accessibility standards in a virtual campus provides benefits for all the academic community that in some cases could face difficulties to learn through the VLE. This work proposes an innovative practice to implement, promote and include accessibility features in a VLE through an intensive training workshop based on best practices. This approach is addressed to technical staff involved in the installation, maintenance and support of e-Learning solutions in academic institutions, with a special focus on software and web engineering. A first staff training experience was implemented in seven countries in LA with more than 180 participants from 52 different Higher Education Institutions (HEI). Results from the experience manifest a growing interest from HEIs in accessibility topics and encourage improving the workshop materials for new editions.

The main goal of the game is to help and motivate blind teenage students to learn and like mathematics. The graphics are designed for low vision students but to guarantee accessibility to blind students, the game can be played without the need to see the graphics. All the features are complemented with audio and the game uses 2D spatialized audio. Having graphics also contributes to the integration of visually impaired students with their sighted colleagues.

This study addresses cognitive functioning and quality of life for people diagnosed with dementia via technology. In recent times, the influx of older adults suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia related illness has impacted the U.S. Healthcare system. Cognition significantly declines in older adults with AD or dementia over the course of the disease, causing most to be dependent on caregivers, thus routinely institutionalized. Caregivers are often required to focus their attention on addressing the agitation or discomfort of the AD or dementia patient. Research has shown that technology instruments such as iPods, help stimulate those with dementia. This study focuses on innovative devices such as iPads and tablets, which are mainstream and easy to use, cannot only help determine stage of dementia, but also provide stimulation to improve cognitive functioning. It is hoped that this research will analyze that specially created apps and existing assistive software can be used to decrease the symptoms and improve cognition of older adults suffering from AD or other dementia related diseases. Via service-learning courses, students developed an easy-to-use application for tablets to help- older adults with disabilities more readily use the technology. Student programmers produced apps and performed usability tests with the dementia patients, as well as met with geriatric facility personnel to produce application software that meets the patients, family, and caregiver needs and expectations. For example, a student term project produced an application entitled Candoo that utilizes Google's voice recognition and synthesis engine to navigate the web, provide the weather, and supply pill reminder alerts. Another application example included one that allows families to electronically send photographs, video clips, and favorite music from anywhere to loved ones for enjoyment. Furthermore, older adults were assessed by nursing students for cognitive functioning before, and after the semester's intervention. Such mobile apps could allow dementia persons to become less agitated and stay in their homes longer, while also providing awareness and positive change of attitude by those of another generation towards the elderly. This research will discuss student developed mobile applications in the scope of helping improve the quality of life of patients with AD or dementia.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6245-0; POD:978-1-4673-6244-3","10.1109/LISAT.2013.6578252","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6578252","Accessibility;Aged User;Assistive Technologyies;Computer Science Education;Elderly;Older Adults;Senior Citizen;Software Engineering;Sundowning","Animals;Dementia;Mobile communication;Sociology;Statistics;Tablet computers","cognition;diseases;geriatrics;handicapped aids;mobile computing;patient treatment;speech recognition;speech synthesis","AD;Alzheimer patients;Candoo;Google voice recognition;Google voice synthesis engine;US healthcare system;caregiver anecdotes;cognitive abilities;cognitive functioning;geriatric facilities;iPads;iPods;mobile app development;music;nonverbal late-stage dementia patients;older adults;photographs;service-learning courses;student programmers;tablet application;usability research;usability tests;video clips","","5","","19","","","","3-3 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Healthcare, education, business, and many other domains look at cloud computing as an endeavor to solve the continuous shortage in volume, infrastructure, accessibility, and monitoring potency. However, moving data to the cloud implies shifting control of the customer's data to the cloud service provider indefinitely. Hence, the security and privacy of the customer's information becomes an important issue. Being an emerging field, there is a lack of experience in cloud security and lack of consensus on security and privacy. Assessing and comparing among potential cloud computing services, poses an issue for novice customers interested to move their work to the cloud to choose security options that are sufficient and robust at the same time. This paper attempts to identify and categorize a list of attributes which reflect the various aspects of cloud security and privacy. These attributes can be used to assess and compare cloud computing services so that consumers can make well educated choices.

Existing motion recognition techniques are not easy to apply to the smartphone directly, since it has limited resources compared to the desktop or notebook computer. But, smartphones have an advantage over any other computer, since smartphones are equipped with various sensors including orientation sensor and acceleration sensor. Nowadays, smartphones have various input ways to communicate with user through text, image or QR code and user's motion. Also, smartphones are able to communicate and exchange data with other electronic devices using Wifi or Buletooth technique. It gives lots of possibilities to offer convenience to consumers and one of examples is smartphone can be used as an input devices or a remote controller for home appliances. It will be particularly helpful to elders or disabled persons since the phone is the closest to person than any other electronic device on the current human life style. To develop better application software as a remote controller operated by user's motion, the motion should be investigated and analyzed trajectories of smartphone to get dynamic characteristics of user's actions. In this research, three different periodic motions such as tilt, zooming in-out and swing were studied by analyzing trajectories of a smartphone using outputs of orientation sensor and acceleration sensor. The result of our experiment shows that the average one period time of three motions is 1.88±0.07sec while one period time for three motion are 1.84sec for tilt, 1.98sec for zoom in-out and 1.81sec for swing. The result of additional experiment of additional two motions shows that two motions' one period time are within the range of three motions'. At the current stage, the result shows that stereotype of hand motion's one gesture is about 1.9sec, but it needs further research to reconfi- m. However, the stereotype of hand motion's one gesture means that any repetitive hand motion using smartphone could be utilized as one of input way, such as motion of moving up-down and moving right-left. Furthermore, if the motion shows a periodic aspect, user does not need to wait until sensor is stabilized or calibrated at the initial operating stage. The result of this research will be applied to the universal design or barrier free design of home appliances to give better accessibility and convenience to everybody including elders and handicapped persons.","","Electronic:978-89-94364-18-6; POD:978-1-4673-1326-1","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6418692","design for all;guide line;human-smartphone-interface;motion analysis;stereotype","Acceleration;Character recognition;Home appliances;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Mobile communication","domestic appliances;gesture recognition;product design;production engineering computing;smart phones;user interfaces","Bluetooth technique;QR code;Wi-Fi;acceleration sensor;barrier free design;dynamic characteristic analysis;electronic device;home appliance;human smartphone interface;image code;motion recognition technique;orientation sensor;periodic motion;remote controller;smartphone trajectory;swing motion;text code;tilt motion;universal design;user hand-motion;wireless fidelity;zooming in-out motion","","0","","11","","","","27-29 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although we are surrounded by the products of engineering in our everyday lives, students often do not understand the importance of the engineering profession. Research strongly connects engineering to mathematics and science skills but does not associate engineering with problem solving, creativity, or the positive impacts on the world. It is disturbing to see how few young students understand the relevance and excitement of engineering. In the United States, there is a danger of having an insufficient supply of creative, young innovators for the future. It is important to give the next generation of engineers the ability to tinker, explore, and experiment with relevant world topics, such as renewable energy, infrastructure, improved transportation, and medical care. By combining the knowledge and tools of today, students can understand the importance and constraints of the problem and find an engineering solution. Today, educators face limitations in delivering these relevant challenges to students in an affordable and accessible manner. Educators want to provide a hands-on learning experience to empower students while improving the comprehension of fundamental concepts. Traditional tools and techniques are either too expensive for a school to afford or the size makes accessibility to the system a challenge. In this paper, we demonstrate how to give students the ability to gain experience with the relevant challenges using graphical system design and student-owned instrumentation hardware. Through systems like the NI myDAQ miniGrid, students can understand the concepts of renewable energy and sustainability and reinforce topics like solar power and power distribution with systems that fit into the palm of their hand and cost less than $99 USD. The low-cost systems are currently in high schools and universities for the spring 2012 semes- er.

Therefore, the possible source of historical data is through oral tradition, which is have limited trace only to several generations back. In order to preserve their cultures and beliefs, a thorough study on remote communities is required in order to present a precise software architecture that can represent their cultures and beliefs in digital form. This paper will discuss the elicitation process and techniques on remote community cultures which related to marriage process, including preparations, events and beliefs before and during the marriage ceremony. These cultures are integrated into a proposed architecture of genealogy software for remote communities. The proposed genealogy software not only accommodates basic information about individuals, including births, marriages, and deaths but the most important component is the culture behind every event for historical records. The idea of this research is not only to preserve genealogy data, but the cultural of minority ethnic group of remote community in Borneo in a new genealogy software, so that the culture will not be extinct.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1655-3; POD:978-1-4577-1654-6","10.1109/iUSEr.2011.6150570","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6150570","UML;culture;formal VDM++;genealogy;remote communities;software","","history","ICT technologies;beliefs;cultures;elicitation process;genealogy software;historical data;historical records;marriage ceremony;oral tradition;remote communities","","1","","12","","","","Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The realization of the benefits of grids to a larger extent is based on the effective discovery of resources (which could be heterogeneous in nature) that are part of the grid. Thus making resource discovery an integral part of grid environments. An Accessible grid is one that consists of a collection of devices (or resources) which could be fixed or mobile and the connectivity could be wired or wireless with infrastructure being pre-defined or adhoc. The accessibility criteria requires resource discovery to be dynamic as wireless grids focus on wireless connectivity, mobile grids on issues related to mobility and ad hoc grids on ad hoc nature. With resource discovery methods falling broadly under centralized, distributed and semi-distributed (hybrid) models and computing environments falling under structured (it includes grid and p2p), semi-structured (it includes p2p) and unstructured (it includes p2p and adhoc) categories, the suitability of existing resource discovery approaches to wireless, mobile and adhoc grids is still an open research issue.","1738-9445;17389445","Electronic:978-89-5519-155-4; POD:978-1-4244-8830-8","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5745863","Computing Environments;Grid;Grid Computing Classification;RD classification;Resource Discovery","Ad hoc networks;Communication system security;Computational modeling;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Peer to peer computing;Wireless communication","ad hoc networks;grid computing;mobile computing","ad hoc grids;mobile grids;resource discovery;wireless connectivity;wireless grids","","1","","9","","","","13-16 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Student role changed to be knowledge and information hunter rather than receiver, and teaching, meanwhile, is becoming a peripheral activity. Several interactive and new methods of learning has evolved in the last two decades aimed to utilizing the information and communication technology tools to improve the educational process availability and accessibility. The learning management system (LMS) is the system responsible for integrating all learning services and managing teaching and learning activities. It provides a collection of tools and functions to support teaching and learning processes, usually including course management tools, online group discussion, homework collections and grading, and course evaluation. This study was conducted to evaluate different open source learning management systems that were under consideration to be implemented by the College of Medicine, King Saud University (CMKSU), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The study reviewed open source and commercial LMS systems as a future strategy. Objectives: the main objective of the current study was to assess the open source LMS systems based on conducting literature review and practical evaluation. The study included a literature review on LMS including commercial and open source systems. The study focused on evaluating three open source LMS systems, Jusur, Sakai, and Moodle. Jusur is the LMS adopted by the National E-learning center in Saudi Arabia, and the other two LMS systems are considered as the principal open source LMS systems implemented worldwide. Methodology: this study depended on published technical reports, LMS systems official websites, and industry reviews, as well as examining the products features and evaluating how they meet CMKSU needs and requirements. Results: All the three LMS systems provide excellent tools including discussion boards, chat sessions- - , and other collaboration tools. Jusur has a strong localization features and technical support and training. On the other hand Sakai and Moodel were ranked better for the user interface and other content and course management features. Sakai is having the advantage of being developed in Java platform. Moodle and Sakai support integration with other systems, while Jusur support the integration in the offline mode only. Conclusion: Open source LMS systems is more recommended because of its popularity among reputable universities, and the benefits of such systems including exchange of experience and e-courses if the development efforts are guaranteed, as well as the availability of the skills required for the development. In the current study, the evaluation focused on the features of LMS systems and a combination of several frameworks to enhance the evaluation process. All three LMS systems provide excellent tools for student interactions and activities. Standards and integration that make these systems able to communicate with other students and hospitals systems are critical features. In addition, the LMS system should be able as well to mange and accommodate a huge amount of information that needed among medical and educational content, including different subjects, lecture notes, lecture videos, text books, videos of surgeries, and radiology images.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8618-2; POD:978-1-4244-8616-8","10.1109/ICEMT.2010.5657569","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5657569","","Biomedical imaging;Educational institutions;Electronic learning;Information systems;Information technology;Least squares approximation","Java;Web sites;biomedical education;courseware;educational courses;educational institutions;information technology;interactive systems;medical computing;public domain software;teaching","Java platform;Moodle;Sakai;Saudi Arabia;Web site;course management tool;educational process;homework collection;information and communication technology;interactive learning method;learning service;online group discussion;open source learning management system;teaching;university medical education","","6","","32","","","","2-4 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Agent based E-learning can manage the information overload, serve as academic experts, and create programming environments for the learners. There are several characteristics specific to E-learning system such as Interaction, Personalization, Adaptation, Intelligence, Interoperability, Accessibility and Security. Agent based architecture for E-learning system provides the above mentioned features to support instructional design, to retrieve relevant learning materials, to process and analyze data to enable meaningful E-learning recommendations to instructors and learners. But most of the existing E-learning architectures doesn't consider all the features in a single system. So there is a need for a generic architecture that should support all the features to make the E-learning system more efficient.

Users who are physically disabled require a variety of access technology and learning depending on the nature of their disability. The intention of modern technology policy is to enable users with intellectual disabilities to have as much choice and control as possible over their lives, be involved in their communities, and make a valued contribution to the world at work. However, in order to achieve these aims, more effective educational and training media are needed as well as an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) for improving their skills and removing the barriers that turn cognitive impairments into intellectual disability. This paper proposes an (ITS) framework dedicated to users who are deaf as a solution for such a challenge. The proposed system help to meet these needs solves accessibility problem and enables access to information technologies by users with disabilities in a simple and reliable way.","","POD:978-0-7695-3359-9","10.1109/CGIV.2008.49","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627021","","Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Computer science education;Deafness;Educational programs;Human computer interaction;Intelligent systems;Psychology;User interfaces;Visualization","handicapped aids;intelligent tutoring systems","accessibility problem;cognitive impairments;information technologies;intellectual disabilities;intelligent tutoring system","","2","","14","","","","26-28 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This fact can be also illustrated on the case of contemporary lack of IT students like in other engineering disciplines. The dynamics of software engineering and the requirement that IT should be widely used in other disciplines imply that IT professional should understand various knowledge domains and skills like but more intensively than in classical engineering disciplines. This ability is sometimes called versatility. It is difficult for teachers to teach it as they are induced to do research being typically fragmented into small research areas. We give examples when IT experts should behave like classical engineers and when software engineering specific skills are needed. An example is the solution of the problem of falling interests of young people to study engineering and science disciplines, software engineering inclusive. The solution of this issue can have the greatest long term impact on engineering education. It can moreover change the rules for the accessibility and analysis of the data collected by e- government systems. We show that it is necessary to apply IT tools to evaluate the quality of schools and education systems by the success on labor market.

The main causes of these problems are the prevalence of password sniffing and the difficulty of password management due to the increased number of accessible systems. In this paper, we propose a personal password management system called ""One Touch Logon"", which replaces the annoying password-based authentication systems with a simple touch-and-login method. The effectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated by implementing it on widely-used legacy systems such as Microsoft Windows and Web site logons. This mechanism is easy to implement and integrate with current password-based systems through the use of an inexpensive consumer electronic device allowing for fingerprint recognition. Moreover, eliminating the burden of memorizing multiple passwords enables the user to choose hard-to-guess passwords and further increases the utilization of Internet services while improving their accessibility. Our empirical study shows that One Touch Logon gives more benefits as the number of employing sites increases, especially when exceeding the number three1.","","POD:0-7695-2687-X","10.1109/CIT.2006.128","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4019947","","Authentication;Biometrics;Computer science education;Consumer electronics;Costs;Dictionaries;Educational programs;Fingerprint recognition;Information security;Web and internet services","","","","1","","16","","","","Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the self-regulatory learning and scaffolding theories, two subsystems, ""learning scheduler subsystem"" and ""content accessibility subsystem"", are proposed. The learning scheduler subsystem helps learners schedule their learning process and enhance the capability of self-regulated learning. With the use of the content accessibility subsystem, the instructor can organize the contents and teaching materials such that different level of supports can be dynamically provided to learners.

Educational tools aiming to help everyday users to learn, gain and apply knowledge in neural network training have evolved accordingly. Unlike many commercial or freeware tools available on market today, authors have decided to go with the implementation that would provide two significant advantages to an existing tools. In this paper authors are proposing an educational too that is characterized by both transparent accessibility with respect to hardware and software platform on one, and ease of use on the other hand.

"Learning through telemedicine networks","Liqiong Deng; M. S. Poole","Texas A&M Univ., College Station, TX, USA","36th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences, 2003. Proceedings of the","20030206","2003","","","8 pp.","","Telemedicine is advocated for its potential to improve the accessibility and quality of health care delivery while lowering costs. Although the potential benefits of telemedicine have long been a subject of research and intense discussion, the results of actual implementations have been far from conclusive. Most current research, which views telemedicine as a substitute for travel and a basis for economies of scale, is rather limited in exploring the full potential of telemedicine. In this paper, we develop a new framework in which organizational learning is the theoretical basis for explaining the development and potential benefits of telemedicine. We conceptualize telemedicine as an integrated IT-enabled health care network of collaborative relationships. A well-developed telemedicine network is high in density, maintains a balance of strong and weak network ties, and is comprised of a diverse set of relationships. This type of network facilitates learning through the exchange, transfer and distribution of medical information/knowledge, the generation and dissemination of new knowledge about how to collaborate effectively via telemedicine, and the application of this knowledge in telemedicine practice. Viewing telemedicine in this light directs our attention to outcomes not emphasized in most prior research, including the diffusion of medical knowledge and expertise, and the development of collaborative knowledge shared by the health care parties. This paper develops a research model to explain how learning occurs in telemedicine practice, identify factors influencing the learning process, and indicate how thriving telemedicine networks can be built. The model focuses on flexibility of information technology, network density, strength of network ties, and network diversity as key factors having impacts on learning. It also views the acquisition, transfer and sharing of medical knowledge and the development of telemedicine collaborative knowledge as two learning processes occurring simultaneously and recursively, and reinforcing each other. Ultimately, learning is the core process that helps realize the potential of telemedicine.","","POD:0-7695-1874-5","10.1109/HICSS.2003.1174377","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174377","","Collaboration;Communications technology;Costs;Current measurement;Economies of scale;Information technology;Knowledge acquisition;Medical services;Space technology;Telemedicine","biomedical education;computer aided instruction;health care;information dissemination;information networks;medical computing;telemedicine","collaborative knowledge;collaborative relationships;health care delivery;information distribution;information exchange;information technology;information transfer;integrated IT-enabled health care network;knowledge dissemination;knowledge generation;learning processes;medical expertise;medical information;medical knowledge;network density;network diversity;network ties;organizational learning;telemedicine networks","","0","","30","","","","6-9 Jan. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

JESSE will initially emphasize the publication of resources to be used at the university level, but will extend to lower grade levels and also to informal education as submissions and user need demands","","POD:0-7803-6359-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2000.857233","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=857233","","Computer aided instruction;Earth;Educational institutions;Electronic learning;Geoscience;Humans;Image databases;Laboratories;Software libraries;Visualization","educational aids;electronic publishing;geology;geophysics;remote sensing;teaching","Earth science;Earth system science;JESSE;Journal of Earth System Science Education;education;educational aid;electronic journal;geology;geophysics;global change;metadata;peer-reviewed journal;remote sensing;resource material","","1","","9","","","","2000","24 Jul 2000-28 Jul 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"The soft(ware) approach to learning problems in quantitative methods","M. King; I. Kirkwood; C.

Conference Proceedings","20020806","1996","","","141","145","The project was to develop a software delivered diagnostic and remedial system for business students taking subjects in quantitative methods. The system is comprised of a module to diagnose a student's background mathematical knowledge and modules to which the student is directed to remedy any deficiencies that are found. The remedial modules focus on common areas of weakness in mathematics and revise the basic mathematical tools that are needed by business students. For example, there are currently nine modules of which three deal with numbers, graphs and the solution of equations. With the use of multimedia facilities incorporating colour and animation, the system can be perceptually more varied, more interesting and easier to use than existing print based information. For maximum accessibility and ease of implementation, the software was designed to run in a Windows environment using the authoring language Asymetrix “Multimedia Toolbook”. The system is run and administered on the University's Novell network, but the developed software can be readily distributed and run independently of the network. This allows the software to be used off-campus, and makes the system equally accessible to students who are studying by distance education, open learning or who are located on an overseas campus","","POD:0-7803-3173-7","10.1109/MMEE.1996.570255","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=570255","","Distance learning;Econometrics;Education;Environmental economics;Equations;Mathematics;Multimedia systems;Software design;Software testing;Software tools","computer aided instruction;computer animation;computer science education;multimedia systems","Asymetrix;Novell network;Windows environment;animation;authoring language;background mathematical knowledge;business students;distance education;learning problems;mathematical tools;open learning;overseas campus;quantitative methods;software delivered diagnostic and remedial system","","0","","7","","","","3-5 Jul 1996","03 Jul 1996-05 Jul 1996","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
