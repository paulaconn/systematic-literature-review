Oluwaseun,"Department of Computer Science, Adeyemi College of Education, Ondo, Nigeria",2016 Future Technologies Conference (FTC),20170119.0,2016,,,1152,1157,"The healthcare system consists of large volumes of data which are usually generated from diverse sources such as physicians' case notes, hospital admission notes, discharge summaries, pharmacies, insurance companies, medical imaging, laboratories, sensor based devices, genomics, social media as well as articles in medical journals. Healthcare data are however very complex and difficult to manage. This is as a result of the astronomical growth of healthcare data, the high speed at which these data are generated as well as the diversity of data types in healthcare. The capturing, storage, analysis and retrieval of health related data are rapidly shifting from paper based system towards digitization. However, the vast volume as well as the complexity of these data makes it difficult for the data to be processed and analyzed by traditional approaches and techniques. Consequently, technologies such as cloud computing and virtualization are now gradually used for processing massive data effectively and securely in healthcare. Hence, the healthcare system is swiftly becoming a big data industry. Thus, this paper examines the concept of big data in healthcare, its benefits and attendant challenges. This paper revealed that the fragmentation of healthcare data, ethical issues, usability issues as well as security and privacy issues are some of the factors impeding the successful implementation of big data in healthcare. This paper therefore suggests that ensuring security and privacy of healthcare data, the adoption of a standardized healthcare terminology, education strategy and the design of usable systems for processing large volumes of data are some of the ways of successfully implementing big data in healthcare.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-4171-8; POD:978-1-5090-4172-5,10.1109/FTC.2016.7821747,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7821747,big data;healthcare;information and communication technology,Big data;Biomedical imaging;Cloud computing;Databases;Google;Medical services;Security,Big Data;health care,Big Data;data complexity;data diversity;education strategy;healthcare data privacy;healthcare data security;healthcare system;standardized healthcare terminology,,,,,,,,6-7 Dec. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,computing education strategies,5

Lujan-Mora,"Faculty of System Engineering Department of Informatics and Computer Science National Polytechnic School, Ecuador",2015 Second International Conference on eDemocracy & eGovernment (ICEDEG),20150601.0,2015,,,112,119,"e-Education is an umbrella term that refers to educational collaborative environments supported by technology that related not only formal academic institutions programs but also self-learners and teachers around the world. This educational paradigm is of paramount importance for society nowadays, because expands access opportunities to education at all levels. These learning environments can take advantage of Open Educational Resources. Using OER is a growing trend and it is turning into a recommendation by some governments and international education forums. Nevertheless, in spite of the availability of OER websites, quite a few of them do not consider accessibility design principles, therefore these websites present access barriers for users with disabilities. Besides, only a reduce number of these websites offer accessible resources, i.e. digital contents suitable for users with disabilities. On the other hand, in web environment, findability is a design consideration that improves the user's searchable experience by simplifying the location and acquisition of elements in websites. In this restricted scenario, findability of educational resources is a key issue for users with disabilities. In this research, we address the issue of findability of Open Educational Resources (OER), from the perspective of inclusive participation of users with disabilities, by considering three aspects: web accessibility, some usability best practices oriented to users with disabilities and Information Architecture.

In addition, related studies indicate the existence of guidelines to support high level planning for the courses and disciplines in PBL such as infrastructure. Given that context, this paper proposes a tool for supporting PBL planning in Computing Education based on Backward Design Model that will lead teachers to structure their planning in order to comply with PBL processes and principles, maximizing the adherence of proposed activities to the PBL culture considering usability principles. The validation comprised the usability and acceptance evaluation of the tool proposed as well as its structure for conducting teachers planning their learning activities as much adherent as possible to PBL process and principles.

Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are one of such advanced means to access educational material and resources anywhere/anytime in the world. Invention of cloud computing technology has opened many options for organizations and individual to share the educational resources among students. By adopting cloud computing organizations can save various recurring costs such as ICT hardware/software, licensing, storage space, backups, maintenance and human resources. Cloud computing enables teachers and students to access and approach the academic material ubiquitously through portable appliances (smart phones, tablets, IPAD's etc.). There are numerous public cloud applications (offerings) available for accessing educational resources in urban as well as rural vicinity. The Usability evaluation of these cloud-based services in a particular academic atmosphere is significant prior to their adoption. Moreover, this enables the stakeholders to make better decisions to adopt these contemporary services.

This paper addresses the bidirectional coupling between a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) haptic feedback device and a general-purpose modelling and simulation environment. In particular, an open-source library is developed to couple the Force Dimension omega.7 haptic device with the 20-sim modelling and simulation environment. The presented coupling interface is also compatible with all the different haptic devices produced by Force Dimension. The proposed integrated haptic interface makes it possible to track the user's motion, detect collisions between the user-controlled probe and virtual objects, compute reaction forces in response to motion or contacts and exert an intuitive force feedback on the user. A real-time one-to-one correspondence between reality and virtual reality can be transparently created. This allows for a variety of possible applications. Stability issues, performance issues, design and virtual prototyping challenges can be addressed and investigated for research purposes. In addition, design and virtual prototyping are also of interest to industry. Realistic training environments can be developed for the user considering different possible operations and stressing the importance of usability and user experience.

We collected GPS trajectory data from people' daily life on campus and use it as empirical mobility traces to generate decision trees and model trees to predict next venues, arrival times, and user encounter. Mobility regularities are mainly considered in these prediction models, and mobility contexts (e.g., time, location, and speed) act as decision nodes in the classification trees. Experimental results using collected GPS data showed that our system achieves 90% accuracy for predicting a user's next venue using a decision tree algorithm, with minute-level (around 5 min) prediction error for arrival time using the model tree algorithm.

The progress in telematics methods offers new possibilities to deal with this situation. This paper presents a generic and extendable telematics infrastructure offering flexible and mobile telemedicine for patients. More and more sensors and medical actuators are available as commercial ?off-the-shelf? (COTS) devices including personal area communication technologies. The presented system integrates these devices into a distributed network to provide medical care at remote locations. The system is designed to support mobile patients in their daily life and to provide real-time access and remote control in critical situations. Therefore, the combination of different communication types is introduced to meet all requirements. As part of the telemedical system, a Tele-Service-Center with an automated data analysis is integrated into the infrastructure to support the treatment of the patients. Altogether, this system offers the opportunity for improving the medical treatment of the patient while simultaneously reducing the costs.

Few efforts have been made at the college level, especially in the context of biology, to develop HDR in learners. In order to address this gap, we have designed and developed a learning environment, Geneticus Investigatio (GI), to help improve learners' HDR skills in the context of Mendelian genetics.

Imitation learning is relatively cheap in terms of time and labor and is a promising route to give robots the necessary functionalities for a widespread use in households, stores, hospitals, etc. However, current imitation learning techniques struggle with a number of challenges that prevent their wide usability. For instance, robots might not be able to accurately reproduce every human demonstration and it is not always clear how robots should generalize a movement to new contexts. This paper addresses those challenges by presenting a method to incrementally teach context-dependent motor skills to robots. The human demonstrates trajectories for different contexts by moving the links of the robot and partially or fully refines those trajectories by disturbing the movements of the robot while it executes the behavior it has learned so far. A joint probability distribution over trajectories and contexts can then be built based on those demonstrations and refinements. Given a new context, the robot computes the most probable trajectory, which can also be refined by the human. The joint probability distribution is incrementally updated with the refined trajectories.

49,79,Gradual structuring: Evolving the spreadsheet paradigm for expressiveness and learnability,G. Miller; F. Hermans; R. Braun,"School of Computing and Communications, University of Technology Sydney",2016 15th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training (ITHET),20161201.0,2016,,,1,8,"Spreadsheets are arguably the most used form of programming and are frequently used in higher education to teach fundamental concepts about computation. Their success has shown that they are simple enough for a huge number of end users to learn and use. This is in contrast to traditional programming languages and the high dropout rate from introductory programming and computer science. However in comparison to traditional programming languages and structured modelling, spreadsheets are not expressive, placing a limit on the levels of computational thinking that can be taught using the spreadsheet paradigm. This limitation is imposed by the lack of programming language features and abstractions in the paradigm. Furthermore, more advanced spreadsheet features (e.g. array formulae, lookup formulae, R1C1 syntax) can be difficult to learn and use. This paper discusses the idea of adding language features to spreadsheets, enabling the gradual structuring of free-form spreadsheets to more structured models. We propose that this concept is termed Gradual Structuring, and is analogous to the programming language concept of gradual typing. In this analogy, spreadsheets take the place of dynamic programming and structured modelling of static programming. In programming languages, gradual typing allows dynamic programming to be mixed with static programming. It is our contention that dynamic programming is more learnable while static programming is more expressive and abstract. Gradual typing could be used to mitigate the issues in the teaching of traditional programming. Likewise Gradual Structuring can mitigate the conceptual limits that can be taught using current spreadsheets. The key language feature required to enable Gradual Structuring is the ability to logically group cells together so that a single formula can be applied to the grouped cells. This concept, termed cell grouping diminishes and can even eliminate the need for the ubiquitous and error-prone use of copy-p- sted in spreadsheets. Moreover, it makes the structure present in spreadsheet models explicit. Cell grouping requires a cascade of other new languages features. Namely a more expressive referencing style, which in turned requires enabling labels to be moved to the row and column headers, and the hierarchical structuring of these headers. Respectively these language features are termed enhanced referencing and semantic axes. The ongoing research focusses on the usability and learnability of these language features. Spreadsheet applications exist that contain aspects of the features mentioned. However these applications do not enable Gradual Structuring and have taken a mainly technical, not human behavioural, approach to evolving the spreadsheet.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-0778-3; POD:978-1-5090-0779-0; USB:978-1-5090-0777-6,10.1109/ITHET.2016.7760759,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7760759,,Computer languages;Dynamic programming;Education;Electronic mail;Programming profession;Semantics,computer aided instruction;computer science education;further education;programming languages;spreadsheet programs;teaching,R1C1 syntax;array formulae;cell grouping;computation;computer science;dynamic programming;free-form spreadsheets;gradual structuring;gradual typing;higher education;introductory programming;language features;learnability;lookup formulae;programming languages;semantic axes;static programming;structured modelling;teaching;usability,,,,,,,,8-10 Sept. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,computing usability education,7

Within this scenario, a practical and dynamic learning system is being fostered that allows simulations to be carried out in real contexts through problem resolution. Based on constructivist theories, PBL (Problem-Based Learning) is a teaching method that is focused on the students and its main characteristic is that it uses real-world problems to create the learning content and teach the skills required for their solution. However, the adoption of this approach is not an easy task, since it is accompanied by abrupt changes in the traditional paradigm of education, which require changes in the attitudes of the actors involved. In addition, the planning and monitoring of the PBL, involve complex activities that are difficult to manage, especially with regard to determining the quality and compliance of the processes used for problem resolution. Additionally, the Computer Science courses require working on projects provided by real clients, within a dynamic and iterative development process. This strengthens the need to introduce strategies and technologies to support the implementation and management of the method and, enable its effectiveness to be monitored In addition, it provides continuous feedback, and assesses the results generated from the evaluation of the solutions produced during the teaching-learning process. Thus, it is essential to adopt strategies that allow a better management of teaching practice, improved learning by the students and a means of validating the clients involved. From this perspective, this paper presents a virtual teaching and learning environment, called PBLMaestro, which has been designed to support the workflow of a methodology for the implementation of PBL in teaching Computer Science, called xPBL. With the aid of xPBL, it is possible to perform the management of courses using the dy- amics of a cycle and series of stages to allow a better control of management processes, by linking real problems to well-defined educational goals. In the case of teacher planning, we were used elements described in xPBL methodology, aligned with educational goals defined from the Bloom Revised Taxonomy. With regard to student tracking, we used the authentic assessment model and mechanisms of Learning Analytics. Gamification strategies were included to increase engagement, retention and motivation, and push notification messages were displayed in a mobile application the PBLMaestro was validated by means of application the environment in the context of the discipline ?Network Design? of Computer Science Course, and the results are analyzed in this study.

To determine blind users' experience with responsive design, the authors performed empirical tests to investigate the impact of responsive design on the emotions of blind users during web interactions. They measured user emotions by applying the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) instrument. Results show that although the responsive websites investigated had acceptable levels of accessibility, they posed numerous usability barriers and triggered intense, negative user emotions.

Joyce,"Seidenberg School of Computer Science and Information Systems, Pace University 861 Bedford Rd., Pleasantville, NY 10570","2013 IEEE Long Island Systems, Applications and Technology Conference (LISAT)",20130815.0,2013,,,1,6,"Caregiver anecdotes attest that music and photographs play an important role for family members diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD), even those with severe AD. Tablets and iPads, which are prevalent, can be utilized with dementia patients in portraying favorite music and family photographs via apps developed in close partnership with geriatric facilities. Anecdotal research has shown that non-verbal late-stage dementia patients have become stimulated when iPods played their beloved tunes. There is an unmet need in geriatric facilities for stimulating dementia patients, as well providing hard-core data for proving increased cognitive abilities with technology. Technology can help bridge the gap between patients and staff to improve the quality of life for the cognitively impaired. This study addresses cognitive functioning and quality of life for people diagnosed with dementia via technology. In recent times, the influx of older adults suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia related illness has impacted the U.S. Healthcare system. Cognition significantly declines in older adults with AD or dementia over the course of the disease, causing most to be dependent on caregivers, thus routinely institutionalized. Caregivers are often required to focus their attention on addressing the agitation or discomfort of the AD or dementia patient. Research has shown that technology instruments such as iPods, help stimulate those with dementia. This study focuses on innovative devices such as iPads and tablets, which are mainstream and easy to use, cannot only help determine stage of dementia, but also provide stimulation to improve cognitive functioning. It is hoped that this research will analyze that specially created apps and existing assistive software can be used to decrease the symptoms and improve cognition of older adults suffering from AD or other dementia related diseases. Via service-learning courses, students developed an easy-to-use application for tablets to help- older adults with disabilities more readily use the technology. Student programmers produced apps and performed usability tests with the dementia patients, as well as met with geriatric facility personnel to produce application software that meets the patients, family, and caregiver needs and expectations. For example, a student term project produced an application entitled Candoo that utilizes Google's voice recognition and synthesis engine to navigate the web, provide the weather, and supply pill reminder alerts. Another application example included one that allows families to electronically send photographs, video clips, and favorite music from anywhere to loved ones for enjoyment.

Following a review protocol, articles on mobile English language learning from six major databases (IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, ERIC, SpringerLink, and Wiley Online Library) were reviewed. Applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 133 related articles were identified. The results show that the majority of studies were conducted on application m-learning technologies. Pure mobile applications were the most widely-used applications in the English m-learning context. Meanwhile, concerns regarding quality, usability, integration, financial costs, security and privacy, pedagogical practice, and safety were found to be the main challenges of mobile English language learning.

We conducted a systematic literature review of usability defect reporting drawing from both the usability and software engineering literature from January 2000 until March 2016. As a result, a total of 57 studies were identified, in which we classified the studies into three categories: reporting usability defect information, analysing usability defect data and key challenges. Out of these, 20 were software engineering studies and 37 were usability studies. The results of this systematic literature review show that usability defect reporting processes suffer from a number of limitations, including: mixed data, inconsistency of terms and values of usability defect data, and insufficient attributes to classify usability defects.

However, there is a shortage of electronic design automation (EDA) software tools adaptable to AQFP logic. Such tools are essential for designing large-scale-integration circuits efficiently. Therefore, we have developed a first set of EDA tools that handle cell placement and wiring, written in SKILL, the Cadence scripting language. Our tools also consider the maximum wire length constraint that exists in AQFP logic. First, AQFP logic cells are repositioned via the genetic algorithm to minimize the number of wires that violate the wiring length constraint. Buffers are then automatically inserted as signal repeaters for logic rows where the violations still exist. We then complete the logic wiring of the circuit using the channel routing algorithm. We demonstrate the usability of the EDA tools by designing a 16-bit adder as well as a randomly generated test circuit.",1051-8223;10518223,,10.1109/TASC.2017.2721965,"Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S); University of Tokyo in collaboration with Cadence Design Systems, Inc.; VLSI Design and Education Center; 10.13039/501100001667 - Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; ",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7964776,Adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP);channel routing;electronic design automation (EDA);genetic algorithm,Clocks;Layout;Logic gates;Routing;Tools;Wires;Wiring,adders;electronic design automation;genetic algorithms;large scale integration;network routing;parametric oscillators,AQFP logic cells;Cadence scripting language;EDA software tool;EDA tool placement;EDA tool routing;SKILL;adder;adiabatic switching operation;cell placement;channel routing algorithm;electronic design automation;energy-efficient superconductor logic;genetic algorithm;large-scale adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron circuits;large-scale-integration circuits;logic wiring;maximum wire length constraint;randomly-generated test circuit;zero static power dissipation,,,,,,,20170630.0,Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,software engineering usability education,8

For this purpose, we observed users' solution strategies and correlated them with their prevalent personality traits in an exploratory study with student participants within a controlled experiment. We gathered data by screen capturing and chat protocols as well as a Big Five personality traits test. We found strong correlations between particular personality traits and different strategies of removing the findings of static code analysis as well as between personality and tool utilization.

As a consequence, examinations as well as didactical approaches need to become competence-oriented. Unfortunately, competence-oriented examinations and assessments of the efficacy of didactical approaches are fairly hard - currently, no generally accepted approaches for competence-oriented evaluation are available. To make things worse, software engineering is a complex subject matter. Therefore, intended learning outcomes in software engineering education also tend to be quite complex and vary widely with a course's context. This paper provides details on how SECAT, a Software Engineering Competence Assessment Tool, is used to assess the efficacy of didactical approaches in software engineering education in a competence-oriented matter. To that end, SECAT needs to be adapted to the specific context, namely a particular didactical approach with its associated intended learning outcomes. Intended learning outcomes are related to specific competences, including non-technical skills. The paper presents results from applying SECAT for assessing the efficacy of employed didactical approaches in several software engineering courses. Furthermore, the paper shows an example of how SECAT's assessment results are used to improve didactical approaches for upcoming instances of these courses.

In recent years, various software assignment techniques have been designed to introduce heterogeneity into network hosts for the maximum network survivability. However, few work consider practical constraints involved in the software assignment process. To close such a gap, in this work we model the software assignment problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, which incorporates several real-world criteria simultaneously, including network survivability, system feasibility and usability. To solves this multi-objective problem efficiently, we propose an ant colony optimization (ACO) based algorithm, where colonies of artificial ants work collaboratively through both heuristic information and pheromone-mediated communication to iteratively search for better solutions. To validate the generalizability of the proposed method, we experiment our algorithm on various types of network topologies with different parameter settings. The results show that our model can be applied as an effective method for assigning software for multiple objectives.

Web conference lectures were applied in the class on four out of ten courses in total, in the second year of the studies. The summative analysis of the pass rate and the average mark for both groups of students has been carried out in these courses. Then the results that the students achieved in the courses where the web conference was used were compared to the results that they achieved in the courses where the web conference was not used. Based on students' evaluation, the paper also presents formative analysis of efficiency and usefulness in using web conference in the class. Finally, guidelines for the efficient use of web conference in delivering programming courses have been proposed.",,Electronic:978-1-4673-6730-1; POD:978-1-4673-6731-8,10.1109/ITHET.2014.7155687,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155687,collaboration;formative analysis;interaction;summative analysis;web conference,Education;Object oriented modeling;Security;Usability,Internet;computer aided instruction;computer science education;distance learning;engineering education;programming;teaching;virtual reality,Web conference lectures;Web conferencing tools;distance learning environment;engineering informatics study programme;programming courses;programming teaching;summative analysis;virtual environment,,0.0,,13.0,,,,11-13 Sept. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,software engineering usability education,7

Once the phone is locked, the user should take a specific action or provide some secret information to unlock the phone. The existing unlocking approaches can be categorized into four groups: motion, password, pattern, and fingerprint. Existing approaches do not support smart phones well due to the deficiency of security, high cost, and poor usability. We collect 200 users' handwaving actions with their smart phones and discover an appealing observation: the waving pattern of a person is kind of unique, stable and distinguishable. In this paper, we propose OpenSesame, which employs the users' waving patterns for locking/unlocking. The key feature of our system lies in using four fine-grained and statistic features of handwaving to verify users. Moreover, we utilize support vector machine (SVM) for accurate and fast classification. Our technique is robust compatible across different brands of smart phones, without the need of any specialized hardware. Results from comprehensive experiments show that the mean false positive rate of OpenSesame is around 15 percent, while the false negative rate is lower than 8 percent.",1536-1233;15361233,,10.1109/TMC.2014.2341633,Central Universities of China; Doctoral Program of Higher Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - NSFC; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6862001,Smart phone;accelerometer;authentication;privacy;security,Accelerometers;Intelligent sensors;Magnetic sensors;Mobile computing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Smart phones,biometrics (access control);message authentication;smart phones;support vector machines,OpenSesame;SVM;false positive rate;fine-grained feature;handwaving action;handwaving biometrics;screen locking;screen unlocking;secret information;smart phone;statistic feature;support vector machine;waving pattern,,6.0,,23.0,,,20140722.0,May 1 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,software engineering usability education,11

Hendradjaya,"Sekolah Teknik Elektro dan Informatika, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia",2014 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (ICEECS),20150219.0,2014,,,223,228,"The process of blended learning system gives benefits in terms of cost-effectiveness and easy interaction between students and teachers. One of the strategies is to implement the asynchronous type of interaction. An online activity in blended learning using e-learning models is known as a Learning Management System (LMS). Currently LMS has been widely applied in the educational process in higher education institutions. To assess the results of the application of the LMS, we need a quality model that can be referenced by developers of LMS. This study developed a model for the application of quality in an asynchronous blended learning system The model allows an LMS can be evaluated by a party who is not an expert in the field of software technology, especially for the users, who is usually not involved in the system development phase directly. This model is expected to be a reference for both by the developers and users. In this study, the quality of the application the model is applied based on ISO/IEC 9126. This model supports the evaluation of two primary requirements, the needs of virtual communication and the delivery of educational activities, which has seven features, namely: discussion boards, e-mail, blogs, lectures, assignments, quizzes and grades. The quality characteristics in this model, among others are the suitability of implementation, ease of procedures, flexibility (interaction, tests and learner control), user security permissions, as well as response time, availability, reliability and completeness of the system. So the quality factor is proposed functionality (suitability, accurattime behavioreness, security), reliability (maturity), usability (learnability) and efficiency (time behavior). The proposed model was validated with a case study of LMS in the Politeknik Caltex Riau (LMS PCR). The results have shown that the model could offer a quality evaluation of LMS PCR. The model has been able to demonstrate that the LMS PCR was conformed to the re- uirements of an asynchronous blended learning system.",,CD-ROM:978-1-4799-8477-0; Electronic:978-1-4799-8478-7; POD:978-1-4799-8479-4,10.1109/ICEECS.2014.7045251,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045251,ISO/IEC 9126;asynchronous;blended learning;learning management system,Electronic learning;IEC standards;ISO standards;Least squares approximations;Q-factor;Security;Time factors,computer aided instruction;educational institutions;further education,ISO/IEC 9126;LMS;LMS PCR;LMS in the Politeknik Caltex Riau;application model;asynchronous blended learning system;e-learning models;educational activities;educational process;higher education institutions;learning management system quality;online activity;quality model;software technology;virtual communication,,0.0,,37.0,,,,24-25 Nov. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,software engineering usability education,5

66,106,Using Intelligent Tutors to Teach Students How APIs Are Used for Software Engineering in Practice,V. Krishnamoorthy; B. Appasamy; C. Scaffidi,"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University",IEEE Transactions on Education,20130731.0,2013,56.0,3.0,355,363,"Computer science courses typically incorporate integrated training in software engineering, which includes learning how to reuse existing code libraries in new programs. This commonly presents a need to use the libraries' application programming interfaces (APIs) during project-based learning activities. The students learn these APIs with little support from the instructor. Instead, they primarily learn from whatever code examples they find on the Web-a scattershot approach that is slow, frustrating, and sometimes fruitless. Preliminary work investigated an improved approach that provides students with intelligent API tutors. This interactive educational content walks students through code examples selectively harvested from the Web. This approach increased students' knowledge of API method names, but a key pedagogical challenge remained: Students still lacked an understanding of common problems and surprises that they might encounter when using APIs in practice. Perhaps even more crucially, the prior statistical study provided no information about how students would perceive and accept the intelligent tutor approach, when given a choice. Therefore, this paper presents an enhanced approach that augments intelligent tutors with selected information from online FAQs and online open-source code, thereby providing more explanation and context about how to use APIs in practice. A qualitative study assessed student perceptions of the system's usability as well as suggestions for improvement, revealing that 100% of students considered the approach to be useful. A key implication is that providing information from online FAQs, related articles, and open-source code could facilitate computer science students' learning how to use APIs.",0018-9359;00189359,,10.1109/TE.2013.2238543,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6422340,Application programming interface (API);computer science education;electronic learning;software engineering;software libraries,Computer science;Industries;Libraries;Open source software;Software engineering;Training,Internet;application program interfaces;computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;public domain software;software libraries;statistical analysis;teaching,API tutors;Web;application programming interfaces;computer science courses;computer science student learning;instructor;intelligent tutors;interactive educational content;online FAQ;online open source code;project-based learning activities;software engineering;system usability;teaching,,3.0,,37.0,,,20130128.0,Aug. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,software engineering usability education,8

However, in contrast to the collaborative nature of programming, in particular among novice programmers, existing game design environments are solitary desktop-based applications with no or very limited support for sharing and collaboration. We have taken advantage of Web 2.0 technologies and its participative culture to develop a collaborative platform around game design activities that encourages social learning and integrates into the students' online social presence and lifestyle. We have employed open-Web technologies to build a game design environment using only HTML5 and JavaScript that lets users practice the game design and programming activities right inside their browser. Game design and game playing run on the client while an associated website hosts the created games and supports collaboration. This paper reports on the design, implementation, and evaluation of the game design environment.

Within this scenario, a practical and dynamic learning system is being fostered that allows simulations to be carried out in real contexts through problem resolution. Based on constructivist theories, PBL (Problem-Based Learning) is a teaching method that is focused on the students and its main characteristic is that it uses real-world problems to create the learning content and teach the skills required for their solution. However, the adoption of this approach is not an easy task, since it is accompanied by abrupt changes in the traditional paradigm of education, which require changes in the attitudes of the actors involved. In addition, the planning and monitoring of the PBL, involve complex activities that are difficult to manage, especially with regard to determining the quality and compliance of the processes used for problem resolution. Additionally, the Computer Science courses require working on projects provided by real clients, within a dynamic and iterative development process. This strengthens the need to introduce strategies and technologies to support the implementation and management of the method and, enable its effectiveness to be monitored In addition, it provides continuous feedback, and assesses the results generated from the evaluation of the solutions produced during the teaching-learning process. Thus, it is essential to adopt strategies that allow a better management of teaching practice, improved learning by the students and a means of validating the clients involved. From this perspective, this paper presents a virtual teaching and learning environment, called PBLMaestro, which has been designed to support the workflow of a methodology for the implementation of PBL in teaching Computer Science, called xPBL. With the aid of xPBL, it is possible to perform the management of courses using the dy- amics of a cycle and series of stages to allow a better control of management processes, by linking real problems to well-defined educational goals. In the case of teacher planning, we were used elements described in xPBL methodology, aligned with educational goals defined from the Bloom Revised Taxonomy. With regard to student tracking, we used the authentic assessment model and mechanisms of Learning Analytics. Gamification strategies were included to increase engagement, retention and motivation, and push notification messages were displayed in a mobile application the PBLMaestro was validated by means of application the environment in the context of the discipline ?Network Design? of Computer Science Course, and the results are analyzed in this study. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the teachers and there was a high degree of satisfaction among the tutors, students and customers who used the service, with regard to the usability and consistency of the proposed environment as well as with its improvements and changes.

1,4,Gradual structuring: Evolving the spreadsheet paradigm for expressiveness and learnability,G. Miller; F. Hermans; R. Braun,"School of Computing and Communications, University of Technology Sydney",2016 15th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training (ITHET),20161201.0,2016,,,1,8,"Spreadsheets are arguably the most used form of programming and are frequently used in higher education to teach fundamental concepts about computation. Their success has shown that they are simple enough for a huge number of end users to learn and use. This is in contrast to traditional programming languages and the high dropout rate from introductory programming and computer science. However in comparison to traditional programming languages and structured modelling, spreadsheets are not expressive, placing a limit on the levels of computational thinking that can be taught using the spreadsheet paradigm. This limitation is imposed by the lack of programming language features and abstractions in the paradigm. Furthermore, more advanced spreadsheet features (e.g. array formulae, lookup formulae, R1C1 syntax) can be difficult to learn and use. This paper discusses the idea of adding language features to spreadsheets, enabling the gradual structuring of free-form spreadsheets to more structured models. We propose that this concept is termed Gradual Structuring, and is analogous to the programming language concept of gradual typing. In this analogy, spreadsheets take the place of dynamic programming and structured modelling of static programming. In programming languages, gradual typing allows dynamic programming to be mixed with static programming. It is our contention that dynamic programming is more learnable while static programming is more expressive and abstract. Gradual typing could be used to mitigate the issues in the teaching of traditional programming. Likewise Gradual Structuring can mitigate the conceptual limits that can be taught using current spreadsheets. The key language feature required to enable Gradual Structuring is the ability to logically group cells together so that a single formula can be applied to the grouped cells. This concept, termed cell grouping diminishes and can even eliminate the need for the ubiquitous and error-prone use of copy-p- sted in spreadsheets. Moreover, it makes the structure present in spreadsheet models explicit. Cell grouping requires a cascade of other new languages features. Namely a more expressive referencing style, which in turned requires enabling labels to be moved to the row and column headers, and the hierarchical structuring of these headers. Respectively these language features are termed enhanced referencing and semantic axes. The ongoing research focusses on the usability and learnability of these language features. Spreadsheet applications exist that contain aspects of the features mentioned. However these applications do not enable Gradual Structuring and have taken a mainly technical, not human behavioural, approach to evolving the spreadsheet.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-0778-3; POD:978-1-5090-0779-0; USB:978-1-5090-0777-6,10.1109/ITHET.2016.7760759,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7760759,,Computer languages;Dynamic programming;Education;Electronic mail;Programming profession;Semantics,computer aided instruction;computer science education;further education;programming languages;spreadsheet programs;teaching,R1C1 syntax;array formulae;cell grouping;computation;computer science;dynamic programming;free-form spreadsheets;gradual structuring;gradual typing;higher education;introductory programming;language features;learnability;lookup formulae;programming languages;semantic axes;static programming;structured modelling;teaching;usability,,,,,,,,8-10 Sept. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,computer science usability education,7

Thus best of the project fail to generate a product that is usable. This paper presents a case study of minor project course which incorporated UX design in building mobile apps. UX is new technology and little known to instructors at colleges. So students were instructed to learn UX from MOOC on 'UX Design for Mobile Developer's', hosted by Udacity. Also, a workshop by industry expert in UX was conducted. The UX activities specified by MOOC were included as part course assessments. Through the UX design, students identified 3 to 4 user/ mobile device requirements and incorporated them in the implementation. The weightage of marks for UX design is 24%, which increased Design phase weightage to 30%. Finally students were able to launch product, 'KLE Tech STUDio' mobile-app. Attainment of design phase, UX, activities specified by MOOC, implementations are 7.2, 7.82, 6.8 and 7.5 respectively on the scale of 10.

However, there is a shortage of electronic design automation (EDA) software tools adaptable to AQFP logic. Such tools are essential for designing large-scale-integration circuits efficiently. Therefore, we have developed a first set of EDA tools that handle cell placement and wiring, written in SKILL, the Cadence scripting language. Our tools also consider the maximum wire length constraint that exists in AQFP logic. First, AQFP logic cells are repositioned via the genetic algorithm to minimize the number of wires that violate the wiring length constraint. Buffers are then automatically inserted as signal repeaters for logic rows where the violations still exist. We then complete the logic wiring of the circuit using the channel routing algorithm.

We collected GPS trajectory data from people' daily life on campus and use it as empirical mobility traces to generate decision trees and model trees to predict next venues, arrival times, and user encounter. Mobility regularities are mainly considered in these prediction models, and mobility contexts (e.g., time, location, and speed) act as decision nodes in the classification trees. Experimental results using collected GPS data showed that our system achieves 90% accuracy for predicting a user's next venue using a decision tree algorithm, with minute-level (around 5 min) prediction error for arrival time using the model tree algorithm.

Therefore, usability plays an important role in the success of every e-learning system. This study aims to identify the usability problems of CeL and provide recommendations to improve the usability of CeL which specifically focuses on TARUC Johor Branch Campus. Usability testing was conducted on five (5) participants where they had been interviewed and performed series of tasks to identify the usability problem of CeL. The outcome of this project would assist the Communication and Information Technology Centre (CITC) to identify usability problems that exist and provide a recommendation for them to improve the CeL.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-2631-9; POD:978-1-5090-2632-6; USB:978-1-5090-2630-2,10.1109/IUSER.2016.7857935,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7857935,CeL;e-learning;usability testing,Electronic learning;Interviews;Learning systems;Navigation;Testing;Usability,Internet;computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational institutions;further education;product design;teaching,CITC;CeL;College e-Learning system;Internet technology learning;Internet technology teaching;TARUC;Tunku Abdul Rahman University College;communication and information technology centre;private higher education institution;usability testing,,,,,,,,23-25 Aug. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,computer science usability education,5

Oluwaseun,"Department of Computer Science, Adeyemi College of Education, Ondo, Nigeria",2016 Future Technologies Conference (FTC),20170119.0,2016,,,1152,1157,"The healthcare system consists of large volumes of data which are usually generated from diverse sources such as physicians' case notes, hospital admission notes, discharge summaries, pharmacies, insurance companies, medical imaging, laboratories, sensor based devices, genomics, social media as well as articles in medical journals. Healthcare data are however very complex and difficult to manage. This is as a result of the astronomical growth of healthcare data, the high speed at which these data are generated as well as the diversity of data types in healthcare. The capturing, storage, analysis and retrieval of health related data are rapidly shifting from paper based system towards digitization. However, the vast volume as well as the complexity of these data makes it difficult for the data to be processed and analyzed by traditional approaches and techniques. Consequently, technologies such as cloud computing and virtualization are now gradually used for processing massive data effectively and securely in healthcare. Hence, the healthcare system is swiftly becoming a big data industry. Thus, this paper examines the concept of big data in healthcare, its benefits and attendant challenges. This paper revealed that the fragmentation of healthcare data, ethical issues, usability issues as well as security and privacy issues are some of the factors impeding the successful implementation of big data in healthcare. This paper therefore suggests that ensuring security and privacy of healthcare data, the adoption of a standardized healthcare terminology, education strategy and the design of usable systems for processing large volumes of data are some of the ways of successfully implementing big data in healthcare.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-4171-8; POD:978-1-5090-4172-5,10.1109/FTC.2016.7821747,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7821747,big data;healthcare;information and communication technology,Big data;Biomedical imaging;Cloud computing;Databases;Google;Medical services;Security,Big Data;health care,Big Data;data complexity;data diversity;education strategy;healthcare data privacy;healthcare data security;healthcare system;standardized healthcare terminology,,,,,,,,6-7 Dec. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,computer science usability education,5

HDR involves forming hypotheses, designing experiments to test the hypotheses, predicting the outcomes of the experiments, conducting the experiments to observe the outcomes and comparing the predicted and observed outcomes. HDR skill is important for core practices in science such as providing causal explanation for any phenomenon, designing of experiments and accepting or rejecting hypotheses. Few efforts have been made at the college level, especially in the context of biology, to develop HDR in learners. In order to address this gap, we have designed and developed a learning environment, Geneticus Investigatio (GI), to help improve learners' HDR skills in the context of Mendelian genetics. Affordances of technology enhanced learning environments such as agent-based modeling system have been used in the design of GI leveraging functionalities like variable manipulation, system-generated feedback and personalized practice which help learners develop this reasoning.

One is using automatic static analysis tools. We have observed, however, that despite the low-cost help they offer, these tools areunderused and often discourage beginners. There is evidence that personality traits influence the perceived usability of a software. Thus, to support beginners better, we need to understand how theworkflow of people with different prevalent personality traits using these tools varies. For this purpose, we observed users' solution strategies and correlated them with their prevalent personality traits in an exploratory study with student participants within a controlled experiment. We gathered data by screen capturing and chat protocols as well as a Big Five personality traits test. We found strong correlations between particular personality traits and different strategies of removing the findings of static code analysis as well as between personality and tool utilization. Based on that, we offer take-away improvement suggestions.

Imitation learning is relatively cheap in terms of time and labor and is a promising route to give robots the necessary functionalities for a widespread use in households, stores, hospitals, etc. However, current imitation learning techniques struggle with a number of challenges that prevent their wide usability. For instance, robots might not be able to accurately reproduce every human demonstration and it is not always clear how robots should generalize a movement to new contexts. This paper addresses those challenges by presenting a method to incrementally teach context-dependent motor skills to robots. The human demonstrates trajectories for different contexts by moving the links of the robot and partially or fully refines those trajectories by disturbing the movements of the robot while it executes the behavior it has learned so far. A joint probability distribution over trajectories and contexts can then be built based on those demonstrations and refinements. Given a new context, the robot computes the most probable trajectory, which can also be refined by the human. The joint probability distribution is incrementally updated with the refined trajectories. We have evaluated our method with experiments in which an elastically actuated robot arm with four degrees of freedom learns how to reach a ball at different positions.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-4718-5; POD:978-1-5090-4719-2; USB:978-1-5090-4717-8,10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2016.7803300,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7803300,,Context;Education;Hidden Markov models;Humanoid robots;Manipulators;Trajectory,human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulators;mobile robots;probability;robot programming,context-dependent motor skills;hand coding;human demonstrations;incremental imitation learning;joint probability distribution;motor skill teaching;robot arm;robots,,,,,,,,15-17 Nov. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,computer science usability education,7

Unfortunately, competence-oriented examinations and assessments of the efficacy of didactical approaches are fairly hard - currently, no generally accepted approaches for competence-oriented evaluation are available. To make things worse, software engineering is a complex subject matter. Therefore, intended learning outcomes in software engineering education also tend to be quite complex and vary widely with a course's context. This paper provides details on how SECAT, a Software Engineering Competence Assessment Tool, is used to assess the efficacy of didactical approaches in software engineering education in a competence-oriented matter. To that end, SECAT needs to be adapted to the specific context, namely a particular didactical approach with its associated intended learning outcomes. Intended learning outcomes are related to specific competences, including non-technical skills. The paper presents results from applying SECAT for assessing the efficacy of employed didactical approaches in several software engineering courses.

This paper addresses the bidirectional coupling between a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) haptic feedback device and a general-purpose modelling and simulation environment. In particular, an open-source library is developed to couple the Force Dimension omega.7 haptic device with the 20-sim modelling and simulation environment. The presented coupling interface is also compatible with all the different haptic devices produced by Force Dimension. The proposed integrated haptic interface makes it possible to track the user's motion, detect collisions between the user-controlled probe and virtual objects, compute reaction forces in response to motion or contacts and exert an intuitive force feedback on the user. A real-time one-to-one correspondence between reality and virtual reality can be transparently created. This allows for a variety of possible applications. Stability issues, performance issues, design and virtual prototyping challenges can be addressed and investigated for research purposes. In addition, design and virtual prototyping are also of interest to industry. Realistic training environments can be developed for the user considering different possible operations and stressing the importance of usability and user experience. Experiments based on using haptics technology in the field of education can also be easily performed. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed coupling, a case study is presented.

In recent years, various software assignment techniques have been designed to introduce heterogeneity into network hosts for the maximum network survivability. However, few work consider practical constraints involved in the software assignment process. To close such a gap, in this work we model the software assignment problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, which incorporates several real-world criteria simultaneously, including network survivability, system feasibility and usability. To solves this multi-objective problem efficiently, we propose an ant colony optimization (ACO) based algorithm, where colonies of artificial ants work collaboratively through both heuristic information and pheromone-mediated communication to iteratively search for better solutions. To validate the generalizability of the proposed method, we experiment our algorithm on various types of network topologies with different parameter settings. The results show that our model can be applied as an effective method for assigning software for multiple objectives.

Using OER is a growing trend and it is turning into a recommendation by some governments and international education forums. Nevertheless, in spite of the availability of OER websites, quite a few of them do not consider accessibility design principles, therefore these websites present access barriers for users with disabilities. Besides, only a reduce number of these websites offer accessible resources, i.e. digital contents suitable for users with disabilities. On the other hand, in web environment, findability is a design consideration that improves the user's searchable experience by simplifying the location and acquisition of elements in websites.

Once the phone is locked, the user should take a specific action or provide some secret information to unlock the phone. The existing unlocking approaches can be categorized into four groups: motion, password, pattern, and fingerprint. Existing approaches do not support smart phones well due to the deficiency of security, high cost, and poor usability. We collect 200 users' handwaving actions with their smart phones and discover an appealing observation: the waving pattern of a person is kind of unique, stable and distinguishable. In this paper, we propose OpenSesame, which employs the users' waving patterns for locking/unlocking. The key feature of our system lies in using four fine-grained and statistic features of handwaving to verify users. Moreover, we utilize support vector machine (SVM) for accurate and fast classification.

One of the strategies is to implement the asynchronous type of interaction. An online activity in blended learning using e-learning models is known as a Learning Management System (LMS). Currently LMS has been widely applied in the educational process in higher education institutions. To assess the results of the application of the LMS, we need a quality model that can be referenced by developers of LMS. This study developed a model for the application of quality in an asynchronous blended learning system The model allows an LMS can be evaluated by a party who is not an expert in the field of software technology, especially for the users, who is usually not involved in the system development phase directly. This model is expected to be a reference for both by the developers and users. In this study, the quality of the application the model is applied based on ISO/IEC 9126. This model supports the evaluation of two primary requirements, the needs of virtual communication and the delivery of educational activities, which has seven features, namely: discussion boards, e-mail, blogs, lectures, assignments, quizzes and grades. The quality characteristics in this model, among others are the suitability of implementation, ease of procedures, flexibility (interaction, tests and learner control), user security permissions, as well as response time, availability, reliability and completeness of the system.

Tablets and iPads, which are prevalent, can be utilized with dementia patients in portraying favorite music and family photographs via apps developed in close partnership with geriatric facilities. Anecdotal research has shown that non-verbal late-stage dementia patients have become stimulated when iPods played their beloved tunes. There is an unmet need in geriatric facilities for stimulating dementia patients, as well providing hard-core data for proving increased cognitive abilities with technology. Technology can help bridge the gap between patients and staff to improve the quality of life for the cognitively impaired. This study addresses cognitive functioning and quality of life for people diagnosed with dementia via technology. In recent times, the influx of older adults suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia related illness has impacted the U.S. Healthcare system. Cognition significantly declines in older adults with AD or dementia over the course of the disease, causing most to be dependent on caregivers, thus routinely institutionalized. Caregivers are often required to focus their attention on addressing the agitation or discomfort of the AD or dementia patient. Research has shown that technology instruments such as iPods, help stimulate those with dementia. This study focuses on innovative devices such as iPads and tablets, which are mainstream and easy to use, cannot only help determine stage of dementia, but also provide stimulation to improve cognitive functioning. It is hoped that this research will analyze that specially created apps and existing assistive software can be used to decrease the symptoms and improve cognition of older adults suffering from AD or other dementia related diseases. Via service-learning courses, students developed an easy-to-use application for tablets to help- older adults with disabilities more readily use the technology. Student programmers produced apps and performed usability tests with the dementia patients, as well as met with geriatric facility personnel to produce application software that meets the patients, family, and caregiver needs and expectations. For example, a student term project produced an application entitled Candoo that utilizes Google's voice recognition and synthesis engine to navigate the web, provide the weather, and supply pill reminder alerts. Another application example included one that allows families to electronically send photographs, video clips, and favorite music from anywhere to loved ones for enjoyment. Furthermore, older adults were assessed by nursing students for cognitive functioning before, and after the semester's intervention. Such mobile apps could allow dementia persons to become less agitated and stay in their homes longer, while also providing awareness and positive change of attitude by those of another generation towards the elderly. This research will discuss student developed mobile applications in the scope of helping improve the quality of life of patients with AD or dementia.",,Electronic:978-1-4673-6245-0; POD:978-1-4673-6244-3,10.1109/LISAT.2013.6578252,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6578252,Accessibility;Aged User;Assistive Technologyies;Computer Science Education;Elderly;Older Adults;Senior Citizen;Software Engineering;Sundowning,Animals;Dementia;Mobile communication;Sociology;Statistics;Tablet computers,cognition;diseases;geriatrics;handicapped aids;mobile computing;patient treatment;speech recognition;speech synthesis,AD;Alzheimer patients;Candoo;Google voice recognition;Google voice synthesis engine;US healthcare system;caregiver anecdotes;cognitive abilities;cognitive functioning;geriatric facilities;iPads;iPods;mobile app development;music;nonverbal late-stage dementia patients;older adults;photographs;service-learning courses;student programmers;tablet application;usability research;usability tests;video clips,,5.0,,19.0,,,,3-3 May 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,computer science usability education,5
151,240,Using Intelligent Tutors to Teach Students How APIs Are Used for Software Engineering in Practice,V. Krishnamoorthy; B. Appasamy; C. Scaffidi,"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University",IEEE Transactions on Education,20130731.0,2013,56.0,3.0,355,363,"Computer science courses typically incorporate integrated training in software engineering, which includes learning how to reuse existing code libraries in new programs. This commonly presents a need to use the libraries' application programming interfaces (APIs) during project-based learning activities. The students learn these APIs with little support from the instructor. Instead, they primarily learn from whatever code examples they find on the Web-a scattershot approach that is slow, frustrating, and sometimes fruitless. Preliminary work investigated an improved approach that provides students with intelligent API tutors. This interactive educational content walks students through code examples selectively harvested from the Web. This approach increased students' knowledge of API method names, but a key pedagogical challenge remained: Students still lacked an understanding of common problems and surprises that they might encounter when using APIs in practice. Perhaps even more crucially, the prior statistical study provided no information about how students would perceive and accept the intelligent tutor approach, when given a choice. Therefore, this paper presents an enhanced approach that augments intelligent tutors with selected information from online FAQs and online open-source code, thereby providing more explanation and context about how to use APIs in practice. A qualitative study assessed student perceptions of the system's usability as well as suggestions for improvement, revealing that 100% of students considered the approach to be useful.

However, in contrast to the collaborative nature of programming, in particular among novice programmers, existing game design environments are solitary desktop-based applications with no or very limited support for sharing and collaboration. We have taken advantage of Web 2.0 technologies and its participative culture to develop a collaborative platform around game design activities that encourages social learning and integrates into the students' online social presence and lifestyle. We have employed open-Web technologies to build a game design environment using only HTML5 and JavaScript that lets users practice the game design and programming activities right inside their browser.

Many concerns are reserved, for instance, how many usage examples can be found on the Web? how well do such examples support programmers on earth? what factors have impact on these examples' usability? In this paper, we conducted an exploratory study of usage examples on the web, including their distribution, characteristics like content style, correctness, and complexity, as well as their correlations.

Hence, learning object-oriented concepts is crucial in undergraduate Computer Science or Information Technology programs. Learning object-oriented programming requires high concentration to understand the whole concepts before embarking on the practical aspect. It could be difficult for some students especially novices. In addition, lecturers might not be able to explain the subject effectively due to many factors. This research aims to justify and investigate more aspects to support the understanding of object-oriented concepts through games. Game is one of the approaches that could attract students' attention and increases their focus in learning object-oriented theory and practice. This paper reports a feasibility study using a controlled experiment that investigated the effect of using games in learning object-oriented programming among Computer Science students. The findings show that learners prefer using game as compared to traditional approach of teaching.
