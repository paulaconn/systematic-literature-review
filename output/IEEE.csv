As a teaching tool allows systems to be studied through experimentation where theories and hypotheses can be explored and developed. Therefore, it is necessary to provide laboratory experiences, which has been a challenge for higher education Computing. Aiming to contribute to rethinking the use of computer simulation as a teaching tool, this paper presents a pedagogical proposal that investigates the application of simulation in conjunction with the Kolb's Theory of Experiential Learning.

Messerschmitt,"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California at Berkeley, CA, USA",Proceedings of the IEEE,20170717.0,2017,105,8.0,1511,1573,"Timekeeping and related functions such as navigation are important in distributed systems with manufactured nodes such as satellites, spacecraft, distributed computing, and communications. With increases in frequencies, velocities, clock rates, and bit rates, as well as the tightening timekeeping and positioning accuracy demanded of applications, relativistic effects increasingly enter as a design consideration. In this paper, representative applications are surveyed to illustrate relativistic effects in timekeeping. The general theory of relativity is avoided by neglecting gravity in the presence of motion and neglecting motion in the presence of gravity. The special theory of relativity combined with the equivalence principle then provide closed-form models that aid system designers in understanding the nature and relevance of relativistic effects. This is applied to modeling relativistic clock rate and time synchronization in the presence of motion or gravity. The kinematics of special relativity is developed using a new simplified approach in which velocity and acceleration are referenced to the frame-invariant proper time rather than the conventional frame-dependent coordinate time. This approach considerably narrows the scope of relativistic effects, and is particularly appropriate for manufactured systems. Further, by decomposing acceleration into components longitudinal and transverse relative to the direction of motion, simple scalar frame-invariant relations between proper and coordinate perspectives follow. The dynamics and conservation laws of special relativity are illustrated by the relativistic rocket equation. Finally, the Lorentz transformation and its implications are derived from first principles, completing a self-contained exposition. Our perspective and approaches are tailored to the needs of engineering practitioners, educators, and students, and our new methodology may be appropriate in an introductory physics education as well.

To this end, this paper investigates the aptness and effectiveness of implementing TUI systems to enhance teaching and learning within higher educational institutes in order to aid the understanding of complex and abstract concepts. The proposal augments mere simulation processes by developing a table-top architecture to allow the real-time interaction and visualization of queuing theory concepts.

The College of Computing and Informatics at UNC Charlotte-comprised of three departments with an undergraduate enrollment of approximately 1,500 students-is a large research institution in an urban setting with a diverse student population. Within this unique context, the project aim is to build a sustainable practice of educational innovation across the undergraduate computing curriculum by increasing faculty awareness of teaching innovations, resources for pedagogical change, and support for teaching practices that engage students. The vision is to create an active learning environment that transforms the student entering the computing undergraduate program from a person with an interest in computing to a person with an affinity identity [1] as a computing professional through these ongoing connections. We employ a systems theory of change for the Connected Learner based on two foundational concepts: flipped classrooms and engagement theory. To achieve related goals of improving student retention and time to graduation, Connected Learner teaching strategies are being integrated across the undergraduate curriculum with an initial focus on introductory gateway courses. Change is occurring via infrastructure supports to sustain learning practices across our college through faculty development initiatives (hiring, training, mentoring, and incentives) that are designed to inform faculty about engagement pedagogies, motivate faculty to adopt these practices, and shift pedagogical attitudes. During the first year of the five-year project, quantitative and qualitative data from students and faculty was collected and analyzed. This data provides a baseline of student attitudes and performance as well as a baseline of faculty attitudes and teaching practices.

This demand requires engineers with specialized skills and knowledge. For this, the higher education institutions are developing training strategies aimed primarily at lectures and laboratory practices. However, these strategies are insufficient for the development of technical and social skills required by engineers. In addition, currently there is a lack of a common framework to facilitate teaching-learning process and achievement of learning objectives. In this paper, the authors present a proposal for representation of teaching and learning practices about embedded systems, which have been oriented to track and encourage competency development. The proposal is based on the SEMAT kernel as universal framework for representing software engineering practices, defining an extension to such kernel. In addition, a methodology is proposed with a practical approach for creating theories related to computing, this methodology is used to define an extension of the SEMAT kernel for another discipline domain. In this paper, a first form of general representation of teaching and learning practices about embedded system is proposed.

This suite of software is distributed in two ways. One distribution is called the XSEDE-compatible basic cluster (XCBC), a Rocks Roll that does an ?all at once, from scratch? installation of core components. The other distribution is called the XSEDE National Integration Toolkit (XNIT), so that specific tools can be downloaded and installed in portions as appropriate on existing clusters. In this paper, we describe the software included in XCBC and XNIT, and examine the use of XCBC installed on the LittleFe cluster design created by the Earlham College Cluster Computing Group as a teaching tool to show the deployment of XCBC from Rocks. In addition, the demonstration of the commercial Limulus HPC200 Deskside Cluster solution is shown as a viable, off-the-shelf cluster that can be adapted to become an XSEDE-like cluster through the use of the XNIT repository. We demonstrate that both approaches to cluster management - use of SCBC to build clusters from scratch and use of XNIT to expand capabilities of existing clusters - aid cluster administrators in administering clusters that are valuable locally and facilitate integration and interoperability of campus clusters with national cyberinfrastructure.

As a result the energy consumption by the networks is increasing and it needs to be managed. This usage can be brought into account for measuring and hence conserving the energy. The consumption is all together considered for the processing, storage and transport of the knowledge granules over the cloud. Since the data accessed in the cloud is ?ondemand?, the prediction techniques like those using rough sets can be used to minimize the transfer of data over the cloud networks. The data over the cloud can be procured with the help of rough set based methods efficiently which can help in conserving the energy.

The evaluation problem in this paper is viewed as a hierarchical decision making problem. In the first level of the hierarchy, the crisp score of each assessment is mapped into an interval type-2 fuzzy set (IT2 FS) for each student. The assessments are then aggregated to obtain the performance of each LO. The linguistic weighted power mean (LWPM) is used as the CWW engine, so that some mandatory requirements can be implemented. Finally, by aggregating the performance of all LOs, the final performance is obtained.

With positive node interactions, in view of standard theories from Markov chains, we prove that the node states asymptotically converge to an agreement at a binary random variable, whose distribution is characterized for large-scale networks by mean-field approximation. Using combinatorial analysis, we also successfully count the number of communication classes of the positive Boolean network explicitly in terms of the topology of the underlying interaction graph, where remarkably minor variation in local structures can drastically change the number of network communication classes. With general Boolean interaction rules, emergence of absorbing network Boolean dynamics is shown to be determined by the network structure with necessary and sufficient conditions established regarding when the Boolean gossip process defines absorbing Markov chains. Particularly, it is shown that for the majority of the Boolean interaction rules, except for nine out of the total 2??-1 possible nonempty sets of binary Boolean functions, whether the induced chain is absorbing has nothing to do with the topology of the underlying interaction graph, as long as connectivity is assumed. These results illustrate the possibilities of relating dynamical properties of Boolean networks to graphical properties of the underlying interactions.",1063-6692;10636692,,10.1109/TNET.2017.2763964,Australian Department of Education and Training through an Endeavour Fellowship; National Center for Mathematics and Interdisciplinary Sciences Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8090536,Boolean networks;Markov chains;communication classes.;gossiping process,Boolean functions;Computational modeling;IEEE transactions;Markov processes;Peer-to-peer computing;Probabilistic logic,,,,,,,,,20171031.0,,,IEEE,IEEE Early Access Articles,computing education theory,12

In this way, people can be clear for both negative and positive elements. The workflow also implements computing algorithms to make the data processing more accurate and scientific. The whole workflow includes three stages: searching for the history, selecting theorists' classification, and results matching and integrating.

Therefore a systematic design for the hydrodynamic shape of AUVs is needed and necessary to meet the various requirements. In the present work, a hierarchical classification for the hull shape of AUVs was proposed according to the shape characteristics of the main hull of AUVs. Focused on the teardrop-shaped AUVs, hydrodynamic drags of a series of hull shapes were computed and analyzed using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation method with different hull shape parameters and Reynolds numbers (Re). The general mathematical model of volumetric coefficient of hydrodynamic drag and hull shape parameters, i.e., length diameter ratio (L/D), nose length diameter ratio (Ln/D), tail length diameter ratio (Lt/D) and Reynolds number (Re), was established and verified.

But still, the effectiveness of the systems is different. The aim of this research is to explore the correlations of the factors in the education systems, furthermore, to model its functionality and examine the effectiveness of various education systems. A possible method for these examinations is the fuzzy cognitive map technology, since it provides an opportunity for the qualitative description of the relationships and parameters. The first experimental group of this study is taken from the Serbian education system. The first task was to collect the data set and the basic statistical processing of the collected data. Then the authors started with the construction of the basic rules of inference, based on the experts' knowledge about the correlations between the system parameters. The Mamdani type inference system was constructed, using statistical analysis of the parameters to determine the membership functions. Summarizing the observations from the previous model and based on statistical correlations of the system parameters, the authors then constructed a static cognitive map, which was tested with various scenarios.

Hu,"State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China",IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,20171018.0,2017,25,5.0,2773,2787,"In this paper, we study the power efficiency and delay performance of the burst mode transmission (BTR) strategy for the IEEE 802.3az energy efficient Ethernet (EEE) protocol. In the BTR strategy, the Ethernet interface goes to sleep once its transmission buffer becomes empty and wakes up as soon as the first arrival has waited for time r or the N-th frame arrives at the interface. Based on the number of arrivals during the vacation time, a new approach is proposed to analyze the M/G/1 queue with vacation times that are governed by the arrival process and the r and N parameters of BTR strategy. Our key idea is to establish the connection between the vacation time and the arrival process to account for their dependency. We first derive the distribution of the number of arrivals during a vacation time based on an event tree of the BTR strategy, from which, we obtain the mean vacation time and the power efficiency. Next, from the condition on the number of arrivals at the end of a vacation period, we derive a generalized P-K formula of the mean delay for EEE systems, and prove that the classical P-K formula of the vacation model is only a special case when the vacation time is independent of the arrival process. Our analysis demonstrates that the r policy and N policy of the BTR strategy are compensating each other. The r policy ensures the frame delay is bounded when the traffic load is light, while the N policy ensures the queue length at the end of vacation times is bounded when the traffic load is heavy. These results, in turn, provide the rules to select appropriate r and N. Our analytical results are confirmed by simulations.",1063-6692;10636692,,10.1109/TNET.2017.2703928,Open Research Fund of Key Laboratory of Optical Fiber Communications (Ministry of Education of China); 10.13039/501100001809 - National Science Foundation of China; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7936512,EEE protocol;Ethernet;IEEE802.3az;M/G/1 queue with vacations;P-K formula,Delays;EPON;IEEE 802.3 Standard;IEEE transactions;Power demand;Protocols;Radiation detectors,IEEE standards;local area networks;protocols;queueing theory,10GBase-T energy efficient ethernet protocol;BTR strategy;IEEE 802.3az;M/G/1 queue;burst mode transmission strategy;power efficiency;traffic load,,,,,,Traditional,20170531.0,Oct. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,computing education theory,14

On account of the broadcast nature of wireless communications, it is assailable to malicious eavesdropping. To tackle this challenge in the paper, we present a relay and jammer selection strategy that selects the jammer and relay nodes from intermediate nodes to improve the security of the eavesdropping attacks. The jammer is used to broadcast artificial interference noise on the eavesdropper. The relay acts as a traditional relay that retransmits source signal from the source to the intended destination. For achieving the maximum secrecy capacity by the selected nodes, we introduce a power allocation approach of intermediate nodes that is formulated as a Bertrand game based on price competition. We prove that an optimal pricing scheme can maximize the secrecy capacity and achieve the optimal profits for the selfish friendly nodes.

The model is comprised of four constructions: graph paradigm of a semantic/ontological scheme, concept mapped testing and evaluation method, analysis algorithms and methods which produce the sets of concept states, and the assessment analytics, which is the process to estimate the students' concept states. The concept states involved three basic sets of the concepts in the domain: Verified Skills (VS), Derived Skills (DS), and Potential Skills (PS). VS means the concepts are known by evidence. DS means the concepts are known by inference. PS means the concepts are ready to be known by inference.

It basically combines the mobile devices with the cloud computing. By the means of on-demand self-service and extendibility, it can offer the infrastructures, platform, entertainments, and software services in a cloud to MUs through the mobile network. However, offering secure access to these services by preserving the privacy of the MU is indeed a challenge for any mobile cloud service provider. In this paper, we aim to propose a new robust anonymous mutual authentication scheme for mobile cloud environment. Through this scheme, both the MU and the service cloud need to prove their legitimacy, and it eventually helps the legitimate mobile cloud user to enjoy n times all the ubiquitous services in a secure and efficient way, where the value of n may differ based on the principal he/she has paid for. The security of the proposed scheme is thoroughly analyzed using both formal as well as informal security analysis.

However, enabling it in an underlay fashion poses a significant challenge pertaining to interference management. In this paper, mode selection and resource allocation for an underlay D2D network is studied while simultaneously providing interference management. The problem is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem whose objective is to maximize the utility of all D2D pairs. To solve this problem, a learning framework is proposed based on a problem-specific Markov chain. From the local balance equation of the designed Markov chain, the transition probabilities are derived for distributed implementation. Then, a novel two phase algorithm is developed to perform mode selection and resource allocation in the respective phases. This algorithm is then shown to converge to a near optimal solution. Moreover, to reduce the computation in the learning framework, two resource allocation algorithms based on matching theory are proposed to output a specific and deterministic solution. The first algorithm employs the one-to-one matching game approach whereas in the second algorithm, the one-to many matching game with externalities and dynamic quota is employed. Simulation results show that the proposed framework converges to a near optimal solution under all scenarios with probability one. Moreover, our results show that the proposed matching game with externalities achieves a performance gain of up to 35 percent in terms of the average utility compared to a classical matching scheme with no externalities.",1536-1233;15361233,,10.1109/TMC.2017.2689768,Basic Science Research Program; 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; 10.13039/501100003725 - National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF); ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7890452,D2D communication;Markov approximation;Resource allocation;heterogeneous cellular networks;matching games with externalities,Cellular networks;Device-to-device communication;Games;Interference;Markov processes;Resource management;Throughput,Markov processes;cellular radio;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;probability;radiofrequency interference;resource allocation,D2D communication;cellular networks;combinatorial optimization problem;device-to-device communications;interference management;learning framework;mode selection;network throughput;one-to-many matching game;one-to-one matching game approach;problem-specific Markov chain;resource allocation algorithms;spectral efficiency;transition probabilities;underlay D2D network,,,,,,Traditional,20170330.0,Nov. 1 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,computing education theory,15

It is of interest to find optimal assignments of tasks to local and remote devices that can take into account the application-specific profile, availability of computational resources, and link connectivity, and find a balance between energy consumption costs of mobile devices and latency for delay-sensitive applications. We formulate an NP-hard problem to minimize the application latency while meeting prescribed resource utilization constraints. Different from most of existing works that either rely on the integer programming solver, or on heuristics that offer no theoretical performance guarantees, we propose Hermes, a novel fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS). We identify for a subset of problem instances, where the application task graphs can be described as serial trees, Hermes provides a solution with latency no more than (1 + ?) times of the minimum while incurring complexity that is polynomial in problem size and 1/?. We further propose an online algorithm to learn the unknown dynamic environment and guarantee that the performance gap compared to the optimal strategy is bounded by a logarithmic function with time. Evaluation is done by using real data set collected from several benchmarks, and is shown that Hermes improves the latency by 16 percent compared to a previously published heuristic and increases CPU computing time by only 0.4 percent of overall latency.",1536-1233;15361233,,10.1109/TMC.2017.2679712,10.13039/100002463 - General Motors Corporation; 10.13039/100009533 - Armenian National Science and Education Fund; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7874147,Mobile cloud computing;approximation algorithms;computational offloading;on-line learning,Cloud computing;Complexity theory;Electronic mail;Mobile computing;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation;Servers,cloud computing;computational complexity;file servers;graph theory;integer programming;linear programming;mobile computing;mobile handsets,CPU computing time;FPTAS;Hermes;NP-hard problem;application task graphs;cloud servers;computational resources;computational tasks offloading;delay-sensitive applications;energy consumption costs;fully polynomial time approximation scheme;integer programming solver;latency optimal task assignment;link connectivity;local resource usage;mobile devices;remote devices;resource utilization constraints;resource-constrained mobile computing;theoretical performance guarantees;unknown dynamic environment,,,,,,Traditional,20170308.0,Nov. 1 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,computing education theory,13

Healthcare data are however very complex and difficult to manage. This is as a result of the astronomical growth of healthcare data, the high speed at which these data are generated as well as the diversity of data types in healthcare. The capturing, storage, analysis and retrieval of health related data are rapidly shifting from paper based system towards digitization. However, the vast volume as well as the complexity of these data makes it difficult for the data to be processed and analyzed by traditional approaches and techniques. Consequently, technologies such as cloud computing and virtualization are now gradually used for processing massive data effectively and securely in healthcare. Hence, the healthcare system is swiftly becoming a big data industry. Thus, this paper examines the concept of big data in healthcare, its benefits and attendant challenges. This paper revealed that the fragmentation of healthcare data, ethical issues, usability issues as well as security and privacy issues are some of the factors impeding the successful implementation of big data in healthcare.

Thota,"Department of Information Technology, Uppsala University, Sweden",2016 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),20161201.0,2016,,,1,7,"An Open Ended Group Project (OEGP) is a distinguishable pedagogical tool, used by teachers in computing, engineering, and information technology courses. The tool contributes to the development of `soft' skills essential for students' future career needs. This paper reports on a phenomenographic study that investigates the research question: What are the ways in which academics teaching Open Ended Group Projects experience teaching the course? Previous studies, using the phenomenographic research approach, have offered insights into academics' conceptions of science learning and teaching. However, there are no studies that investigate the experiences of teachers who use OEGP in their classes. This is the first study, that asks academics using an OEGP how they experience teaching these courses. Students enrolled in a course on computing education research conducted the small-scale study at Uppsala University, Sweden. In order to answer the research question, a theoretical sample was selected with a wide range of relevant population characteristics (e.g. background, prior experience, gender, and age). The semi-structured interview questions focused on understanding of OEGP, the learning objectives of OEGP, strategies for teaching these learning objectives, and the teacher's experience in teaching through OEGP. The results indicate that teachers see their role within OEGP as a coach and that the variation between experiences lies in what is intended to be coached. This variation is presented in a hierarchy (the outcome space). Categories focus on: the team, discipline, problem solving skills, learning and motivation. We also look at the first-hand experience of a student in an OEGP course and discuss the teachers' perceptions of students' experiences of OEGP. The implication for teaching is that a teacher needs to reconsider the way he or she teaches more often in OEGP than in regular courses. There are two reasons for this. First, teaching OEGP is based less on- teaching content knowledge and more on teaching skills. Secondly, OEGP deals with a `real problem', and aspects of the problem continuously change. Teachers are recommended to aim for reaching a higher category, indicating a deeper level of experience, and to use the experience of coaching OEGP in other courses as well. The importance of metacognition (reflection on action) and discussion with other teachers who have experience in teaching OEGP is highlighted.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-1790-4; POD:978-1-5090-1791-1,10.1109/FIE.2016.7757474,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757474,Open Ended Group Project (OEGP);phenomenography;teaching experience,Collaboration;Context;Data analysis;Education;Engineering profession;Information technology;Interviews,computer science education;educational courses;engineering education;teaching,OEGP;Sweden;Uppsala University;academics experience;computing courses;computing education research;engineering courses;information technology courses;metacognition;open ended group projects;pedagogical tool;phenomenographic study;teaching skills,,,,,,,,12-15 Oct. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,computing education strategies,6

This profiling includes recorded data on students' affective responses to learning to discern students' level of motivation and details from generic student profiles to describe and predict student learning patterns. Learning pattern data analysis derives conclusions using decision trees. Through this process, information can be extracted from students' affective responses and students' profile data and relevant correlations between the two data sets can be recognized automatically. A personalized learning component uses this information to offer proactive support to students. This is achieved by recommending personalized courses of action which are beneficial to students.

STEM careers have been noted as particularly discouraging to professionals, especially women, for work/family concerns among other reasons. However, little research has explored the work/family attitudes of prospective professionals in these careers. This paper explores the work/family attitudes of graduate students in computing. Based on data from the Computing Research Association's (CRA) Center for Evaluating the Research Pipeline (CERP) 2011-12 nationwide survey of 1286 computing graduate students, our analysis explores at the aggregate and by sex, the connections between graduate computing education, work/family issues, and career expectations. The analysis of the data reveals work/family issues are important to those in advanced education planning careers in the field. Computing graduate students are strongly influenced by work/family issues in their decision-making regarding advanced computing education. Graduate computing students report high levels of knowledge of work/life strategies and express confidence about their abilities, and their likelihood, for balancing work and family. These findings should help graduate educators and prospective employers concerned with diversity understand the work/family concerns of computing students and future computing professionals.",,Paper:978-1-4799-8454-1,10.1109/FIE.2015.7344176,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344176,computing careers;computing education;gender in computing;work/family attitudes,Aggregates;Education;Engineering profession;Knowledge engineering;Optimized production technology;Pipelines;Planning,computer science education;gender issues,STEM career;computing education;computing graduate student;professional career;work-family attitude;work-family conflict,,,,28.0,,,,21-24 Oct. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,computing education strategies,5

We also seek to add to the existing knowledge base by highlighting how policy and practice can create increased opportunities. So far, we have reported on mentoring methods that support women of color, as well as a unique enactment of activism by women of color in computing. (We define activism as volunteer work in which women engage for the purpose of increasing diversity in the field.) Such activism is an example of a strategy in which women use their own agency to increase opportunities for others like them, a strategy we have found in other disciplines also indirectly supports their own success. What is not fully understood are the many ways women of color act directly, using their own agency to create success for themselves. These agentic strategies are the focus of our current analysis, the strategies they use rather than those enacted upon them by others. In this paper, we present findings from our interviews with women computing students and professionals of color, who describe their approaches, often inspired by those who teach, mentor and even challenge them.

While investigation of metacognitive strategies used by students is now an established research topic within Computer Science and Information Technology education, the study of personal epistemology is relatively undeveloped. This is so despite there being significant epistemological issues associated with learning the subject itself, such as those concerned with the way in which programming exercises change from convergent to divergent problems, or the process by which software project management problems very quickly become ill-defined. In this paper, we describe a preliminary investigation into the personal epistemology of two cohorts of computing students. We review some models of personal epistemological development and describe an empirical study in which we investigated the dimensions of epistemological beliefs of two cohorts of computing students. The results show that there appears to be a wide range of epistemological belief amongst computing students.

Research shows digital goods are superior in terms of minimizing the use of energy and CO2 versus their physical counterparts, including physical activities (e.g, travel). But dematerialization of goods comes with challenges. One of them is security. Various (educational, military, government and medical) institutions have been reluctant in adopting the full dematerialization of their specific goods (medical records, and classified military and government information) and delivery of services because of Cyber adversaries. Transmitting sensitive data for these organizations is, hence, as important as national security.

The studies included are rigorous social science investigations; they rely on empirical evidence--not rhetoric, hunches, folk wisdom, or off-the-cuff speculation about supposed innate differences between men and women.Taking advantage of the recent surge in research in this area, the editors present the latest findings of both qualitative and quantitative studies. Each section begins with an overview of the literature on current research in the field, followed by individual studies. The first section investigates the relationship between gender and information technology among preteens and adolescents, with each study considering what could lead girls' interest in computing to diverge from boys'; the second section, on higher education, includes a nationwide study of computing programs and a cross-national comparison of computing education; the final section, on pathways into the IT workforce, considers both traditional and nontraditional paths to computing careers.",,97802622559,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6280972.pdf&bkn=6267239&pdfType=chapter,,,,,,,,,2008.0,,,,,MIT Press,MIT Press eBook Chapters,computing education strategies,17

Vidhate,"Institute of Engineering, Mumbai",2012 IEEE International Conference on Technology Enhanced Education (ICTEE),20120531.0,2012,,,1,8,"Nowadays there is need to share the knowledge and collaboration with group of people with same interest because people and information which they want to access both is geographically distributed. Information technology plays a major role in the future of education, as they break geographical barriers and make educational content widely available. Knowledge collaboration is possible by creating virtual classrooms by interconnecting lecturers to geographically scattered students. Making educational material, such as tutorials and recorded lectures, available worldwide through high-storage infrastructures. Digitalizing and making books available through high-storage infrastructures. But this E-learning system requires huge investment for high-storage infrastructure. Some educational organizations and research institutes cannot afford expensive investments. On the other hand, in most of the organizations, there are large amounts of underutilized computing power and storage existing. Data Grid connects underutilized secondary storage of machines and provides huge secondary storage. It enables resource sharing among the geographically distributed users and resources. Therefore the institutes which do not have sufficient budget can make use of Data Grid efficiently. In this paper we have presented that how Grid computing can be used for inexpensive collaborative E-learning. Data replication increases availability, reliability of data and allows fast access to data. Replication reduces bandwidth consumption and congestion over communication line. Therefore replication is the major issue in Data Grid. Replication strategies determine when and where to create a replica of the data. A good replication strategy should ideally minimize file access time, reduce network congestion and minimize job execution time to improve performance of Data Grid. We strongly believe that the technological revolution that the grid is about to bring will definitely change the way that people dea- with information and, ultimately, knowledge.

While direct load control of end-use loads has existed for decades, price driven response programs are only beginning to be explored at the distribution level. These programs utilize a price signal as a means to control demand. Active markets allow customers to respond to fluctuations in wholesale electrical costs, but may not allow the utility to control demand. Transactive markets, utilizing distributed controllers and a centralized auction, can be used to create an interactive system which can limit demand at key times on a distribution system, decreasing congestion. With the current proliferation of computing and communication resources, the ability now exists to create transactive demand response programs at the residential level. With the combination of automated bidding and response strategies, coupled with education programs and customer response, emerging demand response programs have the ability to reduce utility demand and congestion in a more controlled manner.

It also helps bridge the gap between knowledge production and its use whenever academics become involved with open source development contrary to the proprietary model where software is produced within the confines of commercial vendors R&D labs. However in higher education, open source has not broken through the bottom of the software stack where it is confined to fulfilling mostly system computing requirements. At the application and visible level, open source adoption is hampered by a number of factors chief amongst these is the lack of reliable ICT governance structures. The problem is exacerbated in developing country contexts where governance in general is subjected to the power-play between several actors of the higher education scene. The governance conundrum faced by open source adoption in developing countries is illustrated through a detailed case study of an open source project failure at GNU, an American-style university in the Gulf region.

Such environments consist of network applications and services. Good interactive response time is crucial to their success. Slow responses can quickly dissuade teachers and learners alike from investing their time in the use of these services. Responsiveness timings taken across 155 Mb/s IP/ATM networks have exposed traditional monolithic server performance as the main bottleneck in interactive response time. A strategy of providing bigger and faster monolithic server hardware in response to each occurrence of system slow down is not a good solution as it is expensive and inflexible. Cluster computing has proven a successful and cost effective alternative to conventional supercomputing and it would now seem to be appropriate to investigate its application to the problem of high performance network service provision. In order to research this issue a replicated resolute architecture has been designed to harness the combined power of multiple independent computers.

Within the engine, typical types of constraint-patterns are firstly defined based on an empirical study of a large number of code repositories. For each pattern, a constraint solving algorithm is designed and implemented. For each program, the engine predicts the most suitable strategy and then applies the strategy to solve path constraints. The experimental results on some well-known benchmarks and real-world applications show that TsmartLW is faster than some state-of-the-art static analysis tools.

First, the design problem of pilot pattern is casted as a convex optimization. From the Karush?Kuhn?Tucker conditions, the optimal analytical expression is derived when source and RS powers are given or fixed. Second, under the total transmit power sum constraint of source node and RS, an optimal power allocation (OPA) strategy is proposed to further alleviate the effect of Sum-MSE.

However, these storage systems usually adopt the same replication and storage strategy to guarantee data availability, i.e., creating the same number of replicas for all data sets and randomly storing them across data nodes. Such strategies do not fully consider the difference requirements of data availability on different data sets. More servers than necessary should thus be used to store replicas of rarely-used data, which will lead to increased energy consumption. To address this issue, we propose an energy-efficient storage strategy for cloud datacenters based on a novel hypergraph coverage model. According to users? requirements of data availability in different applications, our proposed algorithm can selectively determine the corresponding minimum hyperedge coverage, which represents the minimum set of data nodes required in the datacenter. Hence, some other data nodes can be turned off for the purpose of energy saving. We have also implemented our proposed algorithm as a dynamic runtime strategy in a HDFS based prototype datacenter for performance evaluation.

In this paper, we present a novel fault-tolerant workflow scheduling (ICFWS) algorithm for Cloud systems by combining the aforementioned two strategies together to play their respective advantages for fault tolerance while trying to meet the soft deadline of workflow. First, it divides the soft deadline of workflow into multiple sub-deadlines for all tasks. Then, it selects a reasonable fault-tolerant strategy and reserves suitable resource for each task by taking the imbalance sub-deadlines among tasks and on-demand resource provisioning of Cloud systems into consideration. Finally, an online scheduling and reservation adjustment scheme is designed to select a suitable resource for the task with resubmission strategy and adjust the sub-deadlines as well as fault-tolerant strategies of some unexecuted tasks during the task execution process, respectively.

However, in practice there are still some obstacles, such as learning resources are not evenly distributed, limited access to services provided, qualified educators resources are concentrated in specific areas. This led to the emergence of disparities educational process, and technology gap due to differences in ICT infrastructure owned by any educational institution. Therefore this study proposes architecture of cloud-based open learning to solve these problems. The term open learning is used in order to encouraging the development of the concept of Indonesia Open Educational Resources (IOER) and as well as the adoption of concept of cloud computing. There are several phase that we conducted in this research such as analysis, design, implementation, testing, and evaluation phase. The design of the proposed architecture consists of six layers: (1) Infrastructure, (2) Platform, (3) Application, (4) Service, (5) Access, (6) User. As a result of the implementation from this architecture is a prototype of Indonesia - Virtual Open Learning System (iVOLS). In experiment, personalization e-learning runs as a service that need large storage and other shared facilities to conduct the program so the system can delivered different learning materials to different learners. The e-learning personalization in cloud environment classified successful if the learners got the best performance on learning and it shown by their evaluation score.

Sci., Univ. of Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia",16th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology,20140327.0,2014,,,541,546,"Indonesia is a developing country that began to utilize information technology in education. A form of its implementation is the use of e-learning. However, in practice there are still some obstacles, such as learning resources are not evenly distributed, limited access to services provided, qualified educators resources are concentrated in specific areas. This led to the emergence of disparities educational process, and technology gap due to differences in ICT infrastructure owned by any educational institution. Therefore this study propose an architecture of cloud-based open learning to solve these problems. The term open learning is used in order to encouraging the development of the concept of Indonesia Open Educational Resources (IOER) and as well as the adoption of concept of cloud computing. This research through several phases of research including analysis, design, implementation, testing and evaluation. The design of the proposed architecture consists of six layers: (1) Infrastructure, (2) Platform, (3) Application, (4) Service, (5) Access, (6) User. As a results of the implementation from this architecture is a prototype of Indonesia - Virtual Open Learning System (iVOLS). In experiment, personalization e-learning runs as a service that need large storage and other shared facilities to conduct the program so the system can delivered different learning materials to different learners. The personalization e-learning in cloud environment successed when the learners got the best performance on learning and it shown by their evaluation score. Based on the test results and evaluation showed that the availability on Cloud-Based Open Learning further meet user needs. This is indicated by the presence of a simple infrastructure services, application services with just one stage and the availability of a wider range of data and the resource sharing.

However most of the initiatives designed to get students interested in STEM fields are constrained by floor space, budget, or driving distance. These factors, in combination, act to limit the affordability and accessibility of research opportunities in STEM fields to students in schools faced with increasingly limited budgets or lacking access to experienced STEM teachers. Since a trained STEM workforce is crucial to tackling research challenges of importance to the Air Force and the nation, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) Discovery Lab program has developed a Virtual Reality Academy (VRA) program utilizing open source virtual reality software, Open Simulator, to create a virtual collaboration environment called Virtual (reality) Discovery Center (VDC). This 16-region VDC is the key to the Discovery Lab's 1,000 Student Outreach initiative designed to greatly expand the Discovery Lab's ability to make project-based ?hands-on? research experience accessible to students across the country via the Open Simulator collaboration technologies. This paper highlights many of the successful efforts to establish VDC Virtual Learning Academies in areas such as Biology, Nanotechnology, Computer Vision, and Mobile Computing (smartphone apps).

Healthcare, education, business, and many other domains look at cloud computing as an endeavor to solve the continuous shortage in volume, infrastructure, accessibility, and monitoring potency. However, moving data to the cloud implies shifting control of the customer's data to the cloud service provider indefinitely. Hence, the security and privacy of the customer's information becomes an important issue. Being an emerging field, there is a lack of experience in cloud security and lack of consensus on security and privacy. Assessing and comparing among potential cloud computing services, poses an issue for novice customers interested to move their work to the cloud to choose security options that are sufficient and robust at the same time.

OER are digital contents for teaching-learning purpose available through websites, released under an open intellectual property license to allow their free use for self-learners and educators. The OER-based learning is involved in formal and non-formal education and can be included in different educational environments, including Elearning. However, despite the growing availability of OER, most of these resources are not accessible to people with disabilities. Hence, the accessibility issues need to be addressed in order to include this vulnerable group of population in OER-based learning opportunities. An accessible environment should be twofold: accessibility of resources and accessibility of OER website that offers the resources. In this paper, we propose a process to guide the creation and release of accessible educational resources and their application to a case study. This case refers the creation of an educational resource accessible for people with severe visual impairments and its release through important OER websites. This accessible resource is a full online course that includes downloadable PDF documents. Moreover, OER websites, where this resource is released, are accessible for people with disabilities. Furthermore, this paper highlights the specific considerations for visual impairments in the design of this resource, and accessibility validation tests conducted with automated tools, simulation software, and user testing. The results of this experience allow recognizing certain problems in the creation of accessible resources as well as the limitations of OER websites to serve people with disabilities.

These learning environments can take advantage of Open Educational Resources. Using OER is a growing trend and it is turning into a recommendation by some governments and international education forums. Nevertheless, in spite of the availability of OER websites, quite a few of them do not consider accessibility design principles, therefore these websites present access barriers for users with disabilities. Besides, only a reduce number of these websites offer accessible resources, i.e. digital contents suitable for users with disabilities. On the other hand, in web environment, findability is a design consideration that improves the user's searchable experience by simplifying the location and acquisition of elements in websites. In this restricted scenario, findability of educational resources is a key issue for users with disabilities.

It proves very useful to help humans perform various tasks, from standard industrial applications to performing tasks that are too difficult or dangerous to do by a person. Nowadays tele-robotic applications as a tool for training and education have also been increasingly popular. The development of a tele-robotic system requires handling the control design as well as the programming, that it gives an excellent practical training to students. In this paper, the development of a control remote laboratory that applies this tele-robotic technology is reported. The system architecture and the control functions within the facility are discussed. The use of minimum hardware for the servers while keeping the functions modular is proposed, and the advantages of this approach in terms of reliability and accessibility are highlighted.

In addition, related studies indicate the existence of guidelines to support high level planning for the courses and disciplines in PBL such as infrastructure. Given that context, this paper proposes a tool for supporting PBL planning in Computing Education based on Backward Design Model that will lead teachers to structure their planning in order to comply with PBL processes and principles, maximizing the adherence of proposed activities to the PBL culture considering usability principles. The validation comprised the usability and acceptance evaluation of the tool proposed as well as its structure for conducting teachers planning their learning activities as much adherent as possible to PBL process and principles.

Invention of cloud computing technology has opened many options for organizations and individual to share the educational resources among students. By adopting cloud computing organizations can save various recurring costs such as ICT hardware/software, licensing, storage space, backups, maintenance and human resources. Cloud computing enables teachers and students to access and approach the academic material ubiquitously through portable appliances (smart phones, tablets, IPAD's etc.). There are numerous public cloud applications (offerings) available for accessing educational resources in urban as well as rural vicinity. The Usability evaluation of these cloud-based services in a particular academic atmosphere is significant prior to their adoption. Moreover, this enables the stakeholders to make better decisions to adopt these contemporary services.

This paper addresses the bidirectional coupling between a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) haptic feedback device and a general-purpose modelling and simulation environment. In particular, an open-source library is developed to couple the Force Dimension omega.7 haptic device with the 20-sim modelling and simulation environment. The presented coupling interface is also compatible with all the different haptic devices produced by Force Dimension. The proposed integrated haptic interface makes it possible to track the user's motion, detect collisions between the user-controlled probe and virtual objects, compute reaction forces in response to motion or contacts and exert an intuitive force feedback on the user. A real-time one-to-one correspondence between reality and virtual reality can be transparently created. This allows for a variety of possible applications. Stability issues, performance issues, design and virtual prototyping challenges can be addressed and investigated for research purposes. In addition, design and virtual prototyping are also of interest to industry. Realistic training environments can be developed for the user considering different possible operations and stressing the importance of usability and user experience.

14,30,The Effects of Electronic Textbook Implementation on Students' Learning in a Chemistry Classroom,R. Y. K. Chiu; D. S. P. Cheung; W. W. F. Lau,"Dept. of Curriculum & Instruction, Chinese Univ. of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China",2017 International Conference on Learning and Teaching in Computing and Engineering (LaTICE),20171012.0,2017,,,54,61,"Printed textbooks are popular instructional materials in secondary schools but electronic textbooks have been promoted recently. However, little is known about the effects of using e-textbooks on students' learning outcomes and the educational affordance of e-textbooks. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of using an e-textbook on Hong Kong students' learning of chemistry in secondary school. An e-textbook chapter entitled Ions, Ionic bonding and Structure was developed. A checklist was constructed to evaluate the quality of the curriculum and the technical features of the electronic chapter. A pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design was used in this study. Two groups of secondary-4 students (N = 27) from two Hong Kong schools participated; the experimental group used the e-textbook chapter while the comparison group used a traditional chemistry textbook published in Hong Kong to have lessons. After the intervention, the students took a posttest to assess their chemistry achievement and responded to a questionnaire to assess their attitudes towards the e-textbook. A performance test was administered to assess students' psychomotor skills at constructing ionic models. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted to collect teacher and student views about using e-textbook in a chemistry classroom. Results showed that the students in the experimental group performed better than their counterparts in the comparison group in terms of chemistry achievement, but no significant difference was found in the psychomotor domain. Using the newly constructed checklist, both teachers evaluated the e-textbook as good for learning. Both teachers and most of the participating students have positive evaluation of the e-textbook in the semi-structured interviews.

Thus best of the project fail to generate a product that is usable. This paper presents a case study of minor project course which incorporated UX design in building mobile apps. UX is new technology and little known to instructors at colleges. So students were instructed to learn UX from MOOC on 'UX Design for Mobile Developer's', hosted by Udacity. Also, a workshop by industry expert in UX was conducted. The UX activities specified by MOOC were included as part course assessments. Through the UX design, students identified 3 to 4 user/ mobile device requirements and incorporated them in the implementation. The weightage of marks for UX design is 24%, which increased Design phase weightage to 30%. Finally students were able to launch product, 'KLE Tech STUDio' mobile-app. Attainment of design phase, UX, activities specified by MOOC, implementations are 7.2, 7.82, 6.8 and 7.5 respectively on the scale of 10.

Watermarking has been proved as a right-protection mechanism that can provide detectable evidence for the legal ownership of a shared dataset, without compromising its usability. However, the main disadvantage of these conventional techniques is unintelligent, rule-based and they do not directly deal with the data synchronization. Therefore, decoding performance reduces significantly when the watermarked data is transmitted through a real communication channel. This paper proposes an intelligent learning-based watermark scheme for outsourced biomedical time series data. The scheme carries out embedding of watermark data based on modifying mean modulation relationship of approximation coefficients in wavelet domain. In addition, the correlation between modified frequency coefficients and the watermark sequence in wavelet domain is intelligently learnt by a machine learning algorithm. The watermark can be effectively retrieved using this learning algorithm.

A possible solution is to design sound technology-enhanced learning (TEL) environments with relevant content and pedagogical tools to reduce teachers' design efforts. Technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) is a promising framework for understanding how teachers could integrate technologies into classrooms. Scholars have highlighted the ?repurposing? of the framework to inform the design of TEL environments. This study employed the TPACK framework to design the learning environment called `MyCLOUD'. MyCLOUD advances the integration of mobile and cloud technologies for self-directed, collaborative and seamless Chinese Language learning among primary students. In this paper, we unpack how the distributed TPACK resources among the teachers and the researchers have contributed to the design of the learning environment. The analysis is accomplished through researchers' coding and consolidation of 42 meeting minutes throughout the developmental period, thereby outlining the trajectory of the researcher-teacher co-design of the learning environment as a manifestation of newly created TPACK. This is followed by a study of students' perceived usability of the platform, with all three subscales of the user acceptance survey scoring above the mid-point of 3 in their respective mean values.

We collected GPS trajectory data from people' daily life on campus and use it as empirical mobility traces to generate decision trees and model trees to predict next venues, arrival times, and user encounter. Mobility regularities are mainly considered in these prediction models, and mobility contexts (e.g., time, location, and speed) act as decision nodes in the classification trees. Experimental results using collected GPS data showed that our system achieves 90% accuracy for predicting a user's next venue using a decision tree algorithm, with minute-level (around 5 min) prediction error for arrival time using the model tree algorithm.

The progress in telematics methods offers new possibilities to deal with this situation. This paper presents a generic and extendable telematics infrastructure offering flexible and mobile telemedicine for patients. More and more sensors and medical actuators are available as commercial ?off-the-shelf? (COTS) devices including personal area communication technologies. The presented system integrates these devices into a distributed network to provide medical care at remote locations. The system is designed to support mobile patients in their daily life and to provide real-time access and remote control in critical situations. Therefore, the combination of different communication types is introduced to meet all requirements. As part of the telemedical system, a Tele-Service-Center with an automated data analysis is integrated into the infrastructure to support the treatment of the patients. Altogether, this system offers the opportunity for improving the medical treatment of the patient while simultaneously reducing the costs. The presented system was implemented and tested in a case study with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. All stakeholders of the system were involved in the tests and provided a very positive feedback. Their feedback and suggestions regarding usability or technical functions are already implemented and tested.",1932-8184;19328184,,10.1109/JSYST.2015.2458018,10.13039/501100002347 - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF); ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7182276,Medical information systems;networked control systems;telecommunication services;telematics;telemedicine,Actuators;Data acquisition;Diseases;Mobile communication;Sensors;Servers,data analysis;medical computing;patient treatment;telemedicine,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients;data analysis;health care system;medical actuators;mobile telemedicine;patient treatment;sensors;tele-service-center;telematics infrastructure;telematics method;telemedicine system,,1.0,,,,,20150807.0,Sept. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,computing usability education,8

Qin,"Centre for Smart Health, School of Nursing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong",IEEE Transactions on Haptics,20170519.0,2016,9.0,3.0,295,310,"Nasogastric tube (NGT) placement is an essential clinical skill. The training is conventionally performed on rubber mannequins albeit practical limitations. Computer simulation with haptic feedback can potentially offer a more realistic and accessible training method. However, the complex interactions between the tube and the nasogastric passage make it difficult to model the haptic feedback during NGT placement. In this paper, a fuzzy-logic-based approach is proposed to directly transfer the experience of clinicians in NGT placement into the simulation system. Based on their perception of the varying tactile sensation and the conditions during NGT placement, the membership functions and fuzzy rules are defined to develop the force model. Forces created using the model are then combined with friction forces to drive the haptic device and render the insertion forces in real time. A prototype simulator is developed based on the proposed force model and the implementation details are presented. The usability of the prototype is also evaluated by clinical teachers. The proposed methodology has the potential for developing computerized NGT placement training methods for clinical education. It is also applicable for simulation systems involving complicated force interactions or computation-expensive models.",1939-1412;19391412,,10.1109/TOH.2016.2550044,Outstanding Youth Fund of the Jiangsu Province; Polytechnic University; Scholarship of Centre for Smart Health; 10.13039/100005228 - SAR; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7448448,Fuzzy logic;force modeling;haptic rendering;nasogastric tube intubation,Computational modeling;Electron tubes;Finite element analysis;Force;Haptic interfaces;Real-time systems;Training,feedback;fuzzy logic;medical computing,clinical education;clinical teachers;complex interactions;complicated force interactions;computation-expensive models;computer simulation;computerized NGT placement;friction forces;fuzzy rules;fuzzy-logic-based approach;haptic device;haptic feedback;haptic simulation;heuristic force model;insertion forces;nasogastric passage;nasogastric tube insertion;prototype simulator;realistic training method;rubber mannequins albeit practical limitations;tactile sensation;training methods,,,,,,,20160406.0,July-Sept. 1 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,computing usability education,15

Imitation learning is relatively cheap in terms of time and labor and is a promising route to give robots the necessary functionalities for a widespread use in households, stores, hospitals, etc. However, current imitation learning techniques struggle with a number of challenges that prevent their wide usability. For instance, robots might not be able to accurately reproduce every human demonstration and it is not always clear how robots should generalize a movement to new contexts. This paper addresses those challenges by presenting a method to incrementally teach context-dependent motor skills to robots. The human demonstrates trajectories for different contexts by moving the links of the robot and partially or fully refines those trajectories by disturbing the movements of the robot while it executes the behavior it has learned so far. A joint probability distribution over trajectories and contexts can then be built based on those demonstrations and refinements. Given a new context, the robot computes the most probable trajectory, which can also be refined by the human. The joint probability distribution is incrementally updated with the refined trajectories. We have evaluated our method with experiments in which an elastically actuated robot arm with four degrees of freedom learns how to reach a ball at different positions.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-4718-5; POD:978-1-5090-4719-2; USB:978-1-5090-4717-8,10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2016.7803300,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7803300,,Context;Education;Hidden Markov models;Humanoid robots;Manipulators;Trajectory,human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulators;mobile robots;probability;robot programming,context-dependent motor skills;hand coding;human demonstrations;incremental imitation learning;joint probability distribution;motor skill teaching;robot arm;robots,,,,,,,,15-17 Nov. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,computing usability education,7

Braun,"School of Computing and Communications, University of Technology Sydney",2016 15th International Conference on Information Technology Based Higher Education and Training (ITHET),20161201.0,2016,,,1,8,"Spreadsheets are arguably the most used form of programming and are frequently used in higher education to teach fundamental concepts about computation. Their success has shown that they are simple enough for a huge number of end users to learn and use. This is in contrast to traditional programming languages and the high dropout rate from introductory programming and computer science. However in comparison to traditional programming languages and structured modelling, spreadsheets are not expressive, placing a limit on the levels of computational thinking that can be taught using the spreadsheet paradigm. This limitation is imposed by the lack of programming language features and abstractions in the paradigm. Furthermore, more advanced spreadsheet features (e.g. array formulae, lookup formulae, R1C1 syntax) can be difficult to learn and use. This paper discusses the idea of adding language features to spreadsheets, enabling the gradual structuring of free-form spreadsheets to more structured models. We propose that this concept is termed Gradual Structuring, and is analogous to the programming language concept of gradual typing. In this analogy, spreadsheets take the place of dynamic programming and structured modelling of static programming. In programming languages, gradual typing allows dynamic programming to be mixed with static programming. It is our contention that dynamic programming is more learnable while static programming is more expressive and abstract. Gradual typing could be used to mitigate the issues in the teaching of traditional programming. Likewise Gradual Structuring can mitigate the conceptual limits that can be taught using current spreadsheets. The key language feature required to enable Gradual Structuring is the ability to logically group cells together so that a single formula can be applied to the grouped cells. This concept, termed cell grouping diminishes and can even eliminate the need for the ubiquitous and error-prone use of copy-p- sted in spreadsheets. Moreover, it makes the structure present in spreadsheet models explicit. Cell grouping requires a cascade of other new languages features. Namely a more expressive referencing style, which in turned requires enabling labels to be moved to the row and column headers, and the hierarchical structuring of these headers. Respectively these language features are termed enhanced referencing and semantic axes. The ongoing research focusses on the usability and learnability of these language features. Spreadsheet applications exist that contain aspects of the features mentioned. However these applications do not enable Gradual Structuring and have taken a mainly technical, not human behavioural, approach to evolving the spreadsheet.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-0778-3; POD:978-1-5090-0779-0; USB:978-1-5090-0777-6,10.1109/ITHET.2016.7760759,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7760759,,Computer languages;Dynamic programming;Education;Electronic mail;Programming profession;Semantics,computer aided instruction;computer science education;further education;programming languages;spreadsheet programs;teaching,R1C1 syntax;array formulae;cell grouping;computation;computer science;dynamic programming;free-form spreadsheets;gradual structuring;gradual typing;higher education;introductory programming;language features;learnability;lookup formulae;programming languages;semantic axes;static programming;structured modelling;teaching;usability,,,,,,,,8-10 Sept. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,computing usability education,7

Within this scenario, a practical and dynamic learning system is being fostered that allows simulations to be carried out in real contexts through problem resolution. Based on constructivist theories, PBL (Problem-Based Learning) is a teaching method that is focused on the students and its main characteristic is that it uses real-world problems to create the learning content and teach the skills required for their solution. However, the adoption of this approach is not an easy task, since it is accompanied by abrupt changes in the traditional paradigm of education, which require changes in the attitudes of the actors involved. In addition, the planning and monitoring of the PBL, involve complex activities that are difficult to manage, especially with regard to determining the quality and compliance of the processes used for problem resolution. Additionally, the Computer Science courses require working on projects provided by real clients, within a dynamic and iterative development process. This strengthens the need to introduce strategies and technologies to support the implementation and management of the method and, enable its effectiveness to be monitored In addition, it provides continuous feedback, and assesses the results generated from the evaluation of the solutions produced during the teaching-learning process. Thus, it is essential to adopt strategies that allow a better management of teaching practice, improved learning by the students and a means of validating the clients involved. From this perspective, this paper presents a virtual teaching and learning environment, called PBLMaestro, which has been designed to support the workflow of a methodology for the implementation of PBL in teaching Computer Science, called xPBL. With the aid of xPBL, it is possible to perform the management of courses using the dy- amics of a cycle and series of stages to allow a better control of management processes, by linking real problems to well-defined educational goals. In the case of teacher planning, we were used elements described in xPBL methodology, aligned with educational goals defined from the Bloom Revised Taxonomy. With regard to student tracking, we used the authentic assessment model and mechanisms of Learning Analytics. Gamification strategies were included to increase engagement, retention and motivation, and push notification messages were displayed in a mobile application the PBLMaestro was validated by means of application the environment in the context of the discipline ?Network Design? of Computer Science Course, and the results are analyzed in this study. In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the teachers and there was a high degree of satisfaction among the tutors, students and customers who used the service, with regard to the usability and consistency of the proposed environment as well as with its improvements and changes.

This paper reports the findings of an empirical study on the socio-cultural aspects of GSEE. A case study was conducted involving 14 participants from ten different universities in eight countries. The data was analyzed using grounded theory's open coding procedure. The key contributions of this paper are the identification and description of seven dimensions of socio-cultural distance that caused several significant challenges in the courses: 1) language differences; 2) concept of time; 3) attitude toward grades; 4) assumptions about national culture; 5) differences in autonomy; 6) influence of the course lecturer; and 7) work habits. Recommendations from this paper that are expected to benefit GSEE educators and students include: cross-cultural orientation of students prior to the course; use of various strategies to support better comprehension of different English accents (e.g., speaking slowly, replaying recorded video messages, and text chatting); and educators familiarizing themselves and their students with the relevant GSE and GSEE literature.",0018-9359;00189359,,10.1109/TE.2016.2624742,Project ???NeXGSD???; 10.13039/501100001537 - University of Auckland; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7755765,Curriculum design;design projects;experiential learning;global software engineering (GSE);grounded theory;higher education;software engineering (SE) education;teamwork,Context;Cultural differences;Global communication;Software;Software engineering;Training,computer science education;software engineering,GSEE;cross-cultural orientation;global software engineering education;open coding procedure;socio-cultural challenges,,,,,,,20161123.0,Aug. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,software engineering education theory,9

However, GT is a complex method based on an inductive paradigm that is fundamentally different from the traditional hypothetico-deductive research model. As there are at least three variants of GT, some ostensibly GT research suffers from method slurring, where researchers adopt an arbitrary subset of GT practices that are not recognizable as GT. In this paper, we describe the variants of GT and identify the core set of GT practices. We then analyze the use of grounded theory in software engineering. We carefully and systematically selected 98 articles that mention GT, of which 52 explicitly claim to use GT, with the other 46 using GT techniques only. Only 16 articles provide detailed accounts of their research procedures. We offer guidelines to improve the quality of both conducting and reporting GT studies.

Starting from assumptions based on cognitive load theory we present the design of an online gamification-based training system to be used in software engineering contexts. Students can voluntarily solve challenges for which they may earn credits. These small problems serve as assessments; the approach follows the assessment for learning paradigm in that assessments provide formative feedback to enhance the learning experience. The combination of formative assessment and gamification is new to software engineering education. We describe system design as well as the different types of challenges in detail.

Especially, more and more distributed control algorithms have been developed for Smart Grids because of their flexibility and robustness. In order to deploy them in real electric power systems, distributed control algorithms must be tested, not only in theoretical simulations, but also in testbeds subject to real world constraints that can provide feedback to make the algorithm robust. Implementations of these algorithms in a Smart Grid environment are facing many cyber-physical challenges such as possible communication failures or imperfections, noisy signals, etc. These challenges can lead to increasing economical expenditure or cause failure of the power system. There exist different approaches for testing distributed control algorithms, from using state-of-the-art facilities to software or hardware-in-the-loop simulations. To better emulate real-world electric grid operation scenarios with low capital investment, in this paper the Green City (GC) testbed is proposed as a suitable platform for both control theory researchers in Smart Grid, and for engineering education, allowing students to learn through hands-on experiences. GC has been conceived as a multi-agent networked CPS with the following main features: 1- Smart Grid environment emulation with low-cost physical elements; 2- Fast prototyping capability of distributed control algorithms for Smart Grid.",,Electronic:978-1-4799-1762-4; POD:978-1-4799-1763-1,10.1109/IECON.2015.7392385,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7392385,Cyber-Physical System;Distributed Control Algorithms;Education;Microgrid;Smart Grid;Testbed,Decentralized control;Generators;Graphical user interfaces;Microgrids;Smart grids;Software;Software algorithms,cyber-physical systems;distributed control;failure analysis;power system control;power system economics;smart power grids,CPS;cyber-physical system;distributed control algorithm;economical expenditure;electric grid operation;electric power system failure;engineering education;fast prototyping capability;green city;hands-on experience;hardware-in-the-loop simulation;low-cost testbed;power availability improvement;power efficiency improvement;smart grid;software-in-the-loop simulation;testing distributed control algorithm,,1.0,,12.0,,,,9-12 Nov. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,software engineering education theory,5

The PMG-2D simulates a real software development environment where the player, acting as a project manager, goes through all basic phases of a software project lifecycle. There are many roles in the team that have to be managed, and the members have different personalities in order to challenge the player when dealing with people and their conflicts and performance, among other characteristics. The mechanism implemented to control the character's personalities is based on the theory of the Five Big Factors, described by the lexical method conceived in the Psychology area. The evaluation was conducted within the context of a software engineering continuing education course, and 25 participants have played the game and answered a questionnaire.

Yukita,"Graduate School of Computer and Information Sciences, Hosei University, Tokyo, Japan",2015 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),20151207.0,2015,,,1,6,"Providing students with suitably complex exercises is crucial to keeping them motivated and leading them to deeper understanding. Making such problems manually takes mathematics teachers' precious time which can otherwise be used to mentor students. Many software tools and services for automatic generation of math problems are found on the Web, but all of them provide only materials of high-school level or below. In addition, no standardized methods are provided to evaluate and control the computational complexity of generated problems. General concepts of complexity in various forms can be found in standard textbooks. The authors treat a different flavor of complexity, subjective complexity, where complexity is measured by the difficulty that learners feel. The authors proposed a new framework for evaluating computational complexity from learners' view, aiming to apply our framework to automatic generation of college math problems with controlled computational complexity. To prove the effectiveness of the new concept of complexity from learners' perspective, we developed some automatic generation tools based on our framework. In this paper, we will present one of the tools that supports automatic generation of eigenvalue problems. Controlling the complexity of eigenvalue problems involves restricting the number of calculation steps, the heights of the involved rationals, and the algebraic number fields appearing in the model solution of the problem. The small-scale experiments showed the relevance of our framework. Our system makes a path to strict quantitative control on various complexity from the learners' view. Future work includes the application of our methods to other areas such as differential equations, number theory and so on. We also should prove that this system has a positive effect on the engineering education at college level.

This work deals with the development of a tool for modelling and simulating fuzzy systems. The tool aims to facilitate the fuzzy systems building process. As an important feature, an execution environment to the model has been developed. This feature improves graphical execution, FCL standard code generation and Java code generation. Furthermore, the tool enables collaborative work, allowing that more than one user simultaneously work on the same project.

There have been some attempts to transfer studio-based teaching to software engineering education. In many ways, this is natural as software engineering has significant practical elements. However, attempts at software studios have usually ignored experiences and theory from arts and design studio teaching. There is therefore a lack of understanding of what ""studio"" really means, how well the concepts transfer to software engineering, and how effective studios are in practice. Without a clear definition of ""studio"", software studios cannot be properly evaluated for their impact on student learning nor can best and worst practices be shared between those who run studios. In this paper, we address this problem head-on by conducting a qualitative analysis of what ""studio"" really means in both arts and design. We carried out 15 interviews with a range of people with studio experiences and present an analysis and model for evaluation here. Our results suggest that there are many intertwined aspects that define studio education, but it is primarily the people and the culture that make a studio.

At the same time, globalization and the need for streamlining time facilitate the development of new methods of imparting knowledge. With the new information technologies, new forms of learning occur adding greater dynamism to the information. This form of learning, which optimizes time and space, is known as distance learning and it is being amply used in many different areas. Distance education presents the advantage of facilitating the teaching and learning processes without face-to-face interaction as knowledge is transmitted, partly or as a whole using technology. In fact, technological innovation has assumed a vital role in education. Looking to achieve more efficiency in carrying out the various activities, the job market constantly requires an investment in new skills and knowledge so that the professionals can operate the equipment and working tools, successfully and with quality. This paper presents a new system of learning a curricular unit of Circuit Theory using desktop virtual reality (VR). The software provides the possibility to understand the relationship between the physical concepts of an electrical circuit, direct or alternating current, through computer simulations and animations. This work was developed to demonstrate how a desktop VR prototype, ?Virtual Electric Manual?-VEMA, can be applied to an engineering unit and used to enhance security and resourcefulness in using electrical equipment. Several interactive scenes were developed to illustrate the idea using a measurements and instrumentation laboratory as virtual environment. A range of interactive learning environments are presented: the menu with the first interactive experiment is the simulator of a DC circuit. It allows the student to analyze the setting up of a parallel, or series-parallel resistive circuit series powered by di- ect current; the second menu, features the simulator of an alternating current circuit and demonstrates how the student can perform the analysis of a circuit with resistors, inductors and capacitors; the third interactive experiment is the simulator of a three-phase alternating current circuit; the fourth menu refers to a study on the transitional phenomena. Finally, the fifth menu is an interactive experiment related to the phenomena of resonance. VEMA offers students the opportunity to understand the processes, helping them to better discern the procedures and trains them to interact with the equipment. The VEMA prototype addresses these issues and highlights the potential benefits of using VR for this purpose.

It is considered to be one of the key factors causing software projects to fail since weak requirements engineering affects other phases and would be costly to correct later. Requirements engineering, to a large extent, is dependent on analysts' experience. The process of requirements engineering often starts from scratch and depends on very much the analysts' experience and educations. Using requirements pattern can help to overcome this. The patterns can be built and put in a repository. In a case of solving a problem, appropriate patterns can be retrieved and used for providing a solution to it. Therefore, knowledge will be reused and there is no need for starting from scratch. This paper is devoted to introducing patterns in requirements engineering process. Semiotics theory is used as the fundamental for creating and using patterns.

Our initial program built on the strengths of Carnegie Mellon's world-class software engineering education. We targeted students working in large companies, engaged in large-scale enterprise software projects, employing ??high ceremony?? software development processes. However, the majority of our students came from Silicon Valley companies which shared a product development focus, engaged in smaller projects, favored agile development processes, and measured development cycles in weeks rather than years. Our program has evolved to align with these interests.

At the core of this information technology revolution has been the Internet with its vast reach into homes, offices, and classrooms making it a ready, easy and reliable tool for self-learning and technical resources. This has helped students pursue their academic interests, honing their skills from basic to advanced levels in an efficient and concise manner. Traditionally, the standard procedure for electrical engineering students to strengthen their theoretical concepts has been to attend various lab classes to gain valuable experience in design and implementation of classroom theories. However, there may be unavoidable circumstances in any engineering student's life arising from social, professional or medical obligations that may prevent him from attending a theory or practical class. The idea of having a virtual laboratory that can be accessed over the Internet is a practical approach to solving this problem and help students to cope up and sharpen their practical skills.

Learning electronics requires a strong theoretical background along with a significant amount of experimental work. However, dealing with highly attended courses implies budgeting limited laboratory resources which prevents students from developing their education on electronics totally. To cover this gap between theory and practice we have elaborated a distance learning methodology that complements analog electronics lectures with support for remote simulation of electronic circuits. This methodology is based on the elaboration of several circuit libraries that cover the most important cases explained at the theoretical courses. These libraries can be simulated employing the software resources available at the Microelectronics Design Laboratory (LDIM).

Argyris and Schoumln made a distinction between espoused theories - those that an individual claims to follow - and theories-in-use - those that can be inferred from action -. In the software engineering field, software processes and practices constitute the espoused theory, since it is what engineers claim to follow. But what engineers - and especially apprentices - do may reveal a different theory-in-use. The capstone project provides students, working in groups, with the possibility to reflect on her/his action and that may help making explicit theories-in-use. The course of action theory considers the observable aspect of the actor's activity, i.e., what is presentable, accountable and commentable. The course-of-action observatory collects data on the courses-of-action. This observatory connects continuous observations and recordings of the agents' behavior, the provoked verbalizations of these agents in activity and the agents' comments in self confrontation with recordings of their behavior. A case study, based on the activity of a team of 6 young software engineer apprentices is used to illustrate the building and the data collecting of the course-of-action observatory and the self-reconstruction of apprentices' activity. As primary results of this work, we may think that self-observing and self-analyzing software engineer's activity help to reveal her/his theory-in-use - what governs engineers' behavior and tends to be tacit structures -and it may help them to learn more suitable theories-in-use, thus contributing to improve productivity and performance.

We recorded and analyzed student's perception of learning over using well defined parameters that reconciled with cognitive, skills and metacognitive goals of SE education. Results corroborated that case study approach is more effective and interesting for learning SE than the lecture based approach. These results indicate that academia and industry should further explore learning-by-doing paradigm, specially the case studies. Benefits of approach include bridging of the industry- academia gap and creation of professionals who are well versed with theory and practice and have experienced the intricacies of real software development even before entering the industry.

The laws related to the patent, copyright, and accountancy for a floatation, and the logical thinking method are the subjects which should be studied as an application subject. In order to prepare the educational environment to study this wide scope of subjects, we must tackle the issues such as restriction of the number of credits and maintenance of lecturer staff. Such issues may be solved by applying less strict criteria when hiring lecturers, reexamining of the whole curriculum, or changing the system of company examination when employing new hires.

The courses cover several aspects of electrical engineering education: linear and nonlinear systems, switching and control theory, electronic measurements, digital data transmission, etc. All the exercise sessions are menu driven and have the same pattern so that the students do not need a background in computers or software. The use of a computer permits the student to spend more time on testing and analyzing several solution methods, conditions, restrictions and properties of certain techniques, etc. instead of wasting time on repetitive calculations. An example that demonstrates the advantages of using a personal computer to solve an exercise is given, followed by the purposes of the network.

Instead, control variables are represented by fuzzy variables which let the level of uncertainty of the variables be modeled in a systematic way. In addition the expert knowledge of a typical operator of such a process is embodied in a set of linguistic or rule-based engines which constitutes the core of a fuzzy controller. The magical advantages of fuzzy controllers over the classical ones have been demonstrated by recent results in diverse application domains as well as the surge of commercial products to worldwide consumer market. Thus, the control engineering research, education, and practice have to be revised accordingly. Fortunately, this area finally found its long-expected place in academia and industry, after its first introduction about thirty years ago. Recently, there have emerged many fuzzy logic software and hardware products. The objective in this paper is to give a comparative review of these resources and techniques, and introduce the reader to the state of knowledge in fuzzy controller design research and education.

There are many team building models available and to choose the most appropriate one is principally the imperative chore. Existing team building models such as RandomM, TeacherM, StudentsM and ProposedM were studied. It was found that they are preference-based and hence prone to bias. To overcome this limitation of preference and bias, 10 parameters have been identified and further ranked based on their suitability by postgraduate students and faculties. The results from the experiment show that Job Prospects, Technology and Stipend are top 3 highest parameters ranked by both groups of stakeholder's viz. students and faculties.

Top motivations for choosing tools are simplicity of learning and installing, as well as the tools being free and supporting the most important notations. Top complaints about tools included not interacting with other tools, not supporting sufficient modeling aspects, and being complex to use. Seven of the tools were used by more than one professor as their main tools, and we analyzed these in more depth. Among these 7, lack of feedback about models emerged as another key weakness. The tools varied very considerably regarding which of these strengths and weaknesses they exhibited.

Ran,"Department of Measurement Control and Information Technology, School of Instrumentation Science and Optoelectronics Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China",IEEE Access,20171006.0,2017,5,,18715,18724,"Video compression has become more and more important nowadays along with the increasing application of video sequences and rapidly growing resolution of them. H.264 is a widely applied video coding standard for academic and commercial purposes. And fractal theory is one of the most active branches in modern mathematics, which has shown a great potential in compression. In this paper, this study proposes an improved inter prediction algorithm for video coding based on fractal theory and H.264. This study take the same approach to make intra predictions as H.264 and this study adopt the fractal theory to make inter predictions. Some improvements are introduced in this algorithm. First, luminance and chrominance components are coded separately and the partitions are no longer associated as in H.264. Second, the partition mode for chrominance components has been changed and the block size now rages from 16 ? 16 to 4 ? 4, which is the same as luminance components. Third, this study introduced adaptive quantization parameter offset, changing the offset for every frame in the quantization process to acquire better reconstructed image. Comparison between the improved algorithm, the original fractal compress algorithm and JM19.0 (The latest H.264/AVC reference software) confirms a slightly increase in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio, a significant decrease in bitrate while the time consumed for compression remains less than 60% of that using JM19.0.",,,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2745538,Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars from the State Education Ministry of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8024180,H.264/AVC;Video compression;fractal theory;inter-frame prediction,Encoding;Extraterrestrial measurements;Fractals;Image coding;Prediction algorithms;Transforms,data compression;fractals;image reconstruction;quantisation (signal);video coding,H.264;adaptive quantization parameter offset;chrominance components;fractal theory;image reconstruction;improved interframe prediction algorithm;luminance components;original fractal compress algorithm;video coding standard;video compression;video sequences,,,,,,OAPA,20170901.0,2017,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,software engineering education theory,9

In the proposed hybrid method, the domains where only the zeroth-order parallel-plate mode exists are modeled by the 2-D DGTD, and the remaining domains are modeled by the 3-D DGTD. Each element is independent with others, thus easily parallelizable. Because higher order modes will propagate in the parallel-plate pair, the spatial domain decomposition should be time-dependent. For domain decomposition criterion at time step t<sub>n</sub>, the electromagnetic field distribution at the previous time step t<sub>n-1</sub> is analyzed to identify the zeroth-order parallel mode domain. Compared with the classical static distance criterion, this new adaptive criterion makes the approximation error under control, thus enhancing the stability.

In this model, based on the individual utility, the strategy state will be asynchronously updated according to the Fermi-like rule. Among them, each individual will be initially endowed with an integral reputation value, and then it evolves during the evolution of strategy; while for the individual utility, it is characterized as the product of the game payoff and a power function of reputation value. Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method is adopted here to verify the system's evolutionary characteristics, and large quantities of simulations demonstrate that the cooperation behavior can be greatly varied and enhanced when the reputation is incorporated into the utility evaluation. Detailed strategy distribution proves that the individual with large reputation value renders the cooperators to lower their risks to be reaped by defectors, and dominates the evolution of cooperation within the whole population. In addition, the whole cooperation phase diagrams show that the coexistence region of cooperators and defectors becomes narrower and narrower as the reputation is introduced more and more. Meanwhile, it is also displayed that the reputation effect favors the evolution of cooperation, and greatly fosters the cooperators to form the compact clusters so as to reduce the risk of being invaded by defectors. To summarize, current results are conducive to making a deeper insight into the evolution of collective cooperation within many real-world biological and man-made systems.",1932-8184;19328184,,10.1109/JSYST.2016.2539364,Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars (Ministry of Education); 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC); 10.13039/501100002858 - China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7448876,Cooperation risk analysis;promotion of cooperation;public goods game (PGG);reputation effect;spatial reciprocity,Analytical models;Evolution (biology);Games;Lattices;Risk analysis;Sociology,Monte Carlo methods;economics;evolutionary computation;game theory;risk analysis;utility theory,Fermi-like rule;MCS;Monte Carlo simulation;PGG;cooperation yielded;evolutionary game;individual utility;risk analysis;risk enhancement;spatial public goods game;utility evaluation,,,,,,Traditional,20160407.0,Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,software engineering education theory,9

An optimal selection model of CU depth is established to estimate the range of candidate CU depth by exploiting the temporal correlation of CU depth among current CU and temporally co-located CUs. To reduce the accumulated errors in the process of CU depth prediction, the maximum depth of the co-located CUs and the coded block flag (CBF) of the current CU are used. Moreover, PU size and CBF information are also used to decide the maximum depth for the current CU. Experimental results show that the proposed CU depth decision approach reduces 56.3% and 51.5% average encoding time, and the Bjontegaard delta bit rate increases only 1.3% and 1.1% for various test sequences under the random access and the low delay B conditions, respectively.",0018-9316;00189316,,10.1109/TBC.2017.2704423,Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7940104,CU depth;High efficiency video coding (HEVC);coding unit (CU);prediction unit (PU),Adaptation models;Bayes methods;Complexity theory;Copper;Correlation;Encoding;Video coding,encoding;video coding,Bjontegaard delta bit rate;CBF;CU depth prediction;H.264-AVC high profile;adaptive inter CU depth decision algorithm;coded block flag;coding efficiency;coding unit;computational complexity;encoding parameters;hierarchical coding structure;hierarchical unit partitioning strategy;high efficiency video coding;optimal selection model;prediction unit;temporal correlation,,,,,,,20170606.0,Sept. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,software engineering education theory,11

And, although, several SE games have been evaluated adopting diverse research designs and measurements, so far no larger scale study across different games has been conducted. In this respect, this article presents a comprehensive analysis in order to summarize empirical evidence on the benefits of digital and non-digital games used for SE education. The analysis is based on data collected from 43 case studies that use MEEGA, the most commonly used model for educational game evaluation, evaluating 20 different SE games, involving a total population of 723 students. Our analysis indicate evidence that digital and non-digital games can yield a positive effect on the learning of SE, providing a pleasant and engaging experience to the students and motivate them. Our analysis also points out that non-digital games more easily seem to promote a more positive experience, principally in terms of fun and social interaction than the digital ones used for teaching SE. These results may guide SE instructors in the selection of educational games as instructional methods and guide game creators with respect to the development of new games.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-2671-9; POD:978-1-5386-2672-6,10.1109/ICSE-SEET.2017.18,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7964340,Empirical evidence;SE game;evaluation,Computational modeling;Context;Games;Q-factor;Software engineering;Training,computer aided instruction;computer games;computer science education;software engineering,MEEGA;SE games;digital games;educational game evaluation;games quality;nondigital games;social interaction;software engineering education;software engineering teaching,,,,,,,,20-28 May 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,software engineering education strategies,9

Kim,"Department of Computer Engineering, Sejong University, Seoul, Korea",IEEE Access,20170520.0,2015,3,,793,804,"Games have been an important tool for motivating undergraduate students majoring in computer science and engineering. However, it is difficult to build an entire game for education from scratch, because the task requires high-level programming skills and expertise to understand the graphics and physics. Recently, there have been many different game artificial intelligence (AI) competitions, ranging from board games to the state-of-the-art video games (car racing, mobile games, first-person shooting games, real-time strategy games, and so on). The competitions have been designed such that participants develop their own AI module on top of public/commercial games. Because the materials are open to the public, it is quite useful to adopt them for an undergraduate course project. In this paper, we report our experiences using the Angry Birds AI Competition for such a project-based course. In the course, teams of students consider computer vision, strategic decision-making, resource management, and bug-free coding for their outcome. To promote understanding of game contents generation and extensive testing on the generalization abilities of the student's AI program, we developed software to help them create user-created levels.

Students beginning their education in automatic control are still taught how to determine system stability, or how to achieve satisfactory steady-state and transient performance at the same time. The strategy applied in developing a new Automatic Control Laboratory in the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the Pennsylvania State University was to present the same classical problems using modern, attractive digital hardware and software. Each experimental set-up in the laboratory is equipped with an individual AT&T 6300 personal computer and printer. The computer system is used for data acquisition, monitoring, and control of the experiments and is thus replacing many devices such as oscilloscopes, function generators, strip chart and x-y recorders, traditionally used in student laboratories. As a result, the use of personal computers with A/D and D/A interface not only brings the elements of attractive technique to the laboratory but it is also cost efficient. The processes studied in a one-credit undergraduate course, Automatic Controls Laboratory, include position and velocity control with d.c. motors, pneumatic servomechanism, and electric air heater. A mixture of commercial and in-house software is available for data acquisition, system analysis and design. Due to the considerable flexibility of the digital equipment, the laboratory is also used in a variety of individual independent study projects as well as in a graduate course on digital process control.",,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4789979,,Automatic control;Control engineering education;Data acquisition;Hardware;Laboratories;Mechanical engineering;Microcomputers;Printers;Stability;Steady-state,,,,2.0,,1.0,,,,15-17 June 1988,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,software engineering education strategies,6

It draws from a large scale research program funded by the European Union and Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), into the emerging ASP industry where software is delivered as a service, priced on a per-seat, per month basis. Tracking a taxonomy of ASPs (pure-play, vertical, horizontal, enterprise and enabler) through longitudinal case study research, the paper suggests that two major inhibitors have contributed to the slow growth of this market. The first is economic conditions evidenced by the dot.com downturn, and the second is lack of education in the potential customer marketplace.

The problem of choosing the ?best? sequence of agents to achieve the optimal social welfare has been investigated and conjectured to be NP-hard. We propose a simple parallel allocation protocol that is insensitive to agents? identities. In every round of the parallel allocation process, every agent asks for an object among those that remain, and every reported object will be allocated randomly to an agent reporting it. Supposing additive utilities and independence between the agents, we compare the average (and worst-case) social welfare achieved by a parallel protocol and a sequential protocol. Theoretical and empirical results show that parallel protocol outperforms a sequential protocol (even when the best sequence of agents is applied). We also show that under the parallel mechanism, some manipulation problems (e.g., finding a successful strategy for a target set and finding an optimal strategy under some scoring function) can be solved in polynomial time.",,,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2764093,Innovation Project of GUET Graduate Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8070933,Distributed resource allocation;manipulation problem;parallel protocol;social welfare,Computer science;Cost accounting;Electrical engineering;Manipulators;Protocols;Resource management;Software,,,,,,,,,20171018.0,2017,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,software engineering education strategies,11

Here we present our experience in introducing 8th graders to recursive strategies where the active observation of recursive algorithms execution allowed pupils to understand the main features of a recursive process, to convince themselves that it works, and to unveil the mystery of its effectiveness.

Here, the network topology is directed and described by a generalized Laplacian matrix L. An individual dynamical system can adopt its own state feedback control law such as a linear-quadratic-regulator controller for an ample stability margin, but it may lose the stability margin to a great extent when the same control strategy utilizing relative state information is used after being interconnected with other dynamical systems. This paper reveals and elaborates upon the following four facts: First, the stability margin after interconnection is quantified via the minimum singular value of a frequency-dependent matrix made up of F and L; Second, the stability margin of a networked dynamical system having a pole at the origin is at most the inverse of the zero-eigenvalue sensitivity of L; Third, there exists an upper bound of the stability margin that has a computational merit, and asymptotically converges to the exact margin with respect to network size, probability of link existence, and control gain in a random network setting; and finally, L can be designed to maximize the stability margin.

The coordination becomes more challenging when the EV owners have different charging preferences. To tackle this problem, a hybrid centralized-decentralized charging control scheme is designed in this paper which mainly includes three parts, as follows. On the centralized charging side, an offline optimal scheduling approach is first presented, aiming at minimizing the energy cost while satisfying the charging requirements of EVs. To deal with the system dynamics and uncertainties, a model predictive control-based adaptive scheduling strategy is then developed to determine the near optimal EV charging profiles in real time. On the decentralized charging side, the interactions between EVs and the charging system controller is modeled as a leader-follower noncooperative Stackelberg game in which the system controller acts as the leader and the EVs act as followers. The existence of the equilibrium state and its optimality are proved and analyzed. It is shown that by adopting the proposed decentralized charging algorithm, the communication burden between EVs and the system controller is low and that the charging scheme is robust to poor communication channels. Last, we investigate how the size of these two charging groups impacts the system utility and propose an algorithm maximizing the total revenues of the whole system. Simulation results evaluate the performances of the scheme and investigate the parameters' impacts on the system utilities.

Apache Hadoop is an open-source ecosystem that manages large data sets in a distributed environment. MapReduce is a programming model that processes massive amount of unstructured data sets over Hadoop cluster. Recently, Hadoop enhances its homogeneous storage function to heterogeneous storage and stores data sets into multiple storage media, i.e., SSD, RAM, and DISK. This development increases the performance of data block placement strategy and allows a client to store large data sets into multiple storage media efficiently than homogeneous storage. However, this evolution increases the consumption of computing capacity and memory usage over MapReduce job scheduling. The scheduler processes MapReduce job into homogeneous container having configuration of CPU, memory, DISK volume, and network I/O, and accesses, processes, and stores data sets over heterogeneous storage media. This produces a processing latency of locating and pairing source data set to MapReduce tasks and results an abnormal high consumption of computing capacity and memory usage in a Datanode. Similarly, when scheduler assigns MapReduce jobs to multiple Datanodes, the same processing latency can severely affect the performance of whole cluster. In this paper, we present Storage-Tag-Aware Scheduler (STAS) that reduces processing latency by scheduling MapReduce jobs into heterogeneous storage containers, i.e., SSD, DISK, and RAM container. STAS endorses job with a tag of storage media, such as JobSSD, JobDISK, and JobRAM and parses them into heterogeneous shared-queues, which assign processing configuration to enlist jobs. STAS manager then schedules shared-queue jobs into heterogeneous MapReduce containers and generates an output into storage media of the cluster. The experimental evaluation shows that STAS optimizes the consumption of computing capacity - nd memory usage efficiently than available schedulers in a Hadoop cluster.",,,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2725318,10.13039/501100003725 - Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea through the Ministry of Education; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7976300,HDFS;Hadoop;MapReduce;scheduler;storage-tier,Containers;Ecosystems;Media;Memory management;Programming;Random access memory;Schedules,Big Data;data analysis;parallel processing;public domain software;scheduling;storage management,Apache Hadoop;Big Data analytics;CPU;DISK volume;Datanode;Hadoop cluster;MapReduce job scheduling;STAS;data block placement strategy;data set storage;distributed environment;heterogeneous MapReduce containers;heterogeneous shared-queues;heterogeneous storage media;memory;multiple storage media;network I/O;open-source ecosystem;processing configuration;programming model;shared-queue jobs;storage-tag-aware scheduler;unstructured data set processesing,,,,,,OAPA,20170712.0,2017,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,software engineering education strategies,13

However, in the fuzzy setting, game graphs are yet to be addressed, although some practical applications, such as modeling fuzzy systems that interact with their environments, appeal to such models. To fill the gap, in this paper, we propose a fuzzy version of game graphs and focus on the fuzzy game graphs with reachability objectives, which we will refer to as fuzzy reachability games (FRGs). In an FRG, the goal of one player is to maximize her truth value of reaching a given target set, while the other player aims at the opposite. In this framework, we show that FRGs are determined in the sense that for every state, both of the two players have the same value, and there exist optimal memoryless strategies for both players. Moreover, we design algorithms, which achieve polynomial time complexity in the size of the FRG, to compute the values of all states and the optimal memoryless strategies for the players. For a special class of FRGs, we provide an improved algorithm that achieves linear-logarithmic running time to compute the values of states.

Sci., Auckland Univ. of Technol., Auckland, New Zealand",2017 IEEE 12th International Conference on Global Software Engineering (ICGSE),20170717.0,2017,,,41,50,"Outsourcing is typically considered to occur in three phases: decision, transition and operation. As outsourcing is now well established the switching of vendors and transitioning from one system to another is common. However, most of the research to date on outsourcing has focused on the decision and operation phases, leaving a gap between theory and practice concerning the transition phase. Transition in outsourcing entails the changing of systems, business processes and/or vendors. If a suitable transition approach is not applied pressures for another transition can immediately build. This paper presents results from a case study carried out on the 'Novopay Project' in which the Ministry of Education in New Zealand changed their vendor from an onshore to a near-shore provider. This project resulted in a sequence of three transitions, with each following a different approach as a direct result of the experiences encountered in the previous transition. In this research we made use of the rich 'data dump' of evidence provided by the Ministry of Education (MoE). Our analysis describes how a client organization can become trapped in a continuous transition cycle if a suitable approach is not applied. Transition1 involved the client - MoE - moving from complete outsourcing to selective insourcing. After realizing that they did not have the capabilities to manage insourcing, Transition2 was initiated. In Transition2 the sourcing approach reverted back to complete outsourcing. When it was realized that the new vendor in Transition2 could not in fact deliver a new service model or support end-users in following new business processes, Transition3 was initiated. In Transition3, the client established an internal company to insource service operations to support end-users. Transition can be a sound business strategy initiated for a range of reasons. However, if a flawed sourcing approach is chosen it can result in 'continuous transition'.",,Electronic:978-1-5386-1587-4; POD:978-1-5386-1588-1,10.1109/ICGSE.2017.6,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7976686,Novopay Project;continuous transition;outsourcing;switching of vendors;transition,Contracts;Data analysis;Organizations;Outsourcing;Software engineering;Switches,business data processing;outsourcing,Ministry of Education;MoE;Novopay Project;business processes;business strategy;continuous transition cycle;data dump;insource service operations;near-shore provider;outsourcing;selective insourcing;service model,,,,,,,,22-23 May 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,software engineering education strategies,9

Project-based learning (PBL) appears as one of the most interesting instructional strategies, the PBL strategy tries to engage students in authentic real-world tasks to enhance learning, PBL is a student-centered strategy that fosters student initiative and focuses the student on real-world, open-ended projects that can increase the motivation for most of them, these projects foster a wide range of abilities including knowledge and practical skills. Two tools were designed to help the students to study MCU based on PBL: a virtual Proteus simulation and a real setup. Using Proteus VSM, software development can begin as soon as the schematic is drawn, and the combination of hardware and software can be thoroughly tested before physical prototype is constructed. The combination of virtual and real setups can realize seamless connection between theory and practice, both virtual and real setups are described by example, and the results obtained by the students are discussed. Students gain hands-on experience, and also improve their skill in product development, self-directed learning, teamwork, and project management. Practical projects increase the challenge for students and, hence, their interest level.

This fact can be also illustrated on the case of contemporary lack of IT students like in other engineering disciplines. The dynamics of software engineering and the requirement that IT should be widely used in other disciplines imply that IT professional should understand various knowledge domains and skills like but more intensively than in classical engineering disciplines. This ability is sometimes called versatility. It is difficult for teachers to teach it as they are induced to do research being typically fragmented into small research areas. We give examples when IT experts should behave like classical engineers and when software engineering specific skills are needed. An example is the solution of the problem of falling interests of young people to study engineering and science disciplines, software engineering inclusive. The solution of this issue can have the greatest long term impact on engineering education. It can moreover change the rules for the accessibility and analysis of the data collected by e- government systems. We show that it is necessary to apply IT tools to evaluate the quality of schools and education systems by the success on labor market.

Unfortunately, the articulation and verification of software system requirements remains one of the most difficult and error-prone tasks in the software development lifecycle. The use of formal methods, based on mathematical logic and discrete mathematics, holds promise for improving the reliability of requirements articulation and modeling. However, formal modeling and reasoning about requirements has not typically been a part of the software analyst's education and training, and because the learning curve for the use of these methods is nontrivial, adoption of formal methods has proceeded slowly. As a consequence, technology transfer is a significant issue in the use of formal methods. In this paper, several efforts undertaken at NASA aimed at increasing the accessibility of formal methods are described. These include the production of the following: two NASA guidebooks on the concepts and applications of formal methods, a body of case studies in the application of formal methods to the specification of requirements for actual NASA projects, and course materials for a professional development course introducing formal methods and their application to the analysis and design of software-intensive systems.

To determine blind users' experience with responsive design, the authors performed empirical tests to investigate the impact of responsive design on the emotions of blind users during web interactions. They measured user emotions by applying the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) instrument. Results show that although the responsive websites investigated had acceptable levels of accessibility, they posed numerous usability barriers and triggered intense, negative user emotions.

A GIS is a computer application that acquire, manipulate, manage, model and visualize geo-referenced data. The goal of a Geo-MOOC is to expand the culture of spatial thinking and the use of geographic information, enabling geospatial web technologies for widespread use. However, the Geo-MOOCs, by nature, have inherent problems of accessibility. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), Article 24, recognize the right of persons with disabilities to education. ?States Parties must ensure that persons with disabilities are able to access general tertiary education, vocational training, adult education and lifelong learning without discrimination and on an equal basis with others? [1]. Therefore, it is important to have accessible Geo-MOOCs. In this paper, we present the results of the evaluation of a Geo-MOOC called ?Maps and the Geospatial Revolution? using three tools available for free on the Internet: Chrome Developer Tools - Accessibility Audit, eXaminator and WAVE; and included a selection of web content and geographical data representative of the course. This provided feedback for establishing recommendations to improve the accessibility of the analyzed course. Other Geo-MOOCs can also benefit from these recommendations.",2165-9559;21659559,Electronic:978-1-4799-3191-0; POD:978-1-4799-3192-7; USB:978-1-4799-3190-3,10.1109/EDUCON.2014.6826167,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6826167,Automatic Accessibility Evaluation Tools;Chrome Accessibility Audit;Geo-MOOC;Geographical Information Systems;Massive Open Online Courses;WAVE;Web Accessibility;eXaminator,Cascading style sheets;Geospatial analysis;Image color analysis;Internet;Vectors;Web pages,Internet;computer aided instruction;educational courses;geographic information systems;information retrieval;interactive programming,Accessibility Audit;CRPD;Chrome Developer Tools;Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities;GIS;Geo-MOOC;Internet;WAVE;Web accessibility evaluation;eXaminator;geographical information systems;massive open online courses,,8.0,,20.0,,,,3-5 April 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,software engineering accessibility education,6

However, recent developments in embedded systems have enabled more powerful and portable processing units capable of analyzing complex data streams in real time. Systems with such capabilities are able to perform tasks such as 3D visual localization and tracking of targets. They are also well-suited for environmental monitoring using a combination of cameras, microphones, and sensors for temperature, air-quality, and pressure. Still there are few compact platforms that combine state of the art hardware with accessible software, an open source design, and an affordable price.

Joyce,"Seidenberg School of Computer Science and Information Systems, Pace University 861 Bedford Rd., Pleasantville, NY 10570","2013 IEEE Long Island Systems, Applications and Technology Conference (LISAT)",20130815.0,2013,,,1,6,"Caregiver anecdotes attest that music and photographs play an important role for family members diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD), even those with severe AD. Tablets and iPads, which are prevalent, can be utilized with dementia patients in portraying favorite music and family photographs via apps developed in close partnership with geriatric facilities. Anecdotal research has shown that non-verbal late-stage dementia patients have become stimulated when iPods played their beloved tunes. There is an unmet need in geriatric facilities for stimulating dementia patients, as well providing hard-core data for proving increased cognitive abilities with technology. Technology can help bridge the gap between patients and staff to improve the quality of life for the cognitively impaired. This study addresses cognitive functioning and quality of life for people diagnosed with dementia via technology. In recent times, the influx of older adults suffering from Alzheimer's or dementia related illness has impacted the U.S. Healthcare system. Cognition significantly declines in older adults with AD or dementia over the course of the disease, causing most to be dependent on caregivers, thus routinely institutionalized. Caregivers are often required to focus their attention on addressing the agitation or discomfort of the AD or dementia patient. Research has shown that technology instruments such as iPods, help stimulate those with dementia. This study focuses on innovative devices such as iPads and tablets, which are mainstream and easy to use, cannot only help determine stage of dementia, but also provide stimulation to improve cognitive functioning. It is hoped that this research will analyze that specially created apps and existing assistive software can be used to decrease the symptoms and improve cognition of older adults suffering from AD or other dementia related diseases. Via service-learning courses, students developed an easy-to-use application for tablets to help- older adults with disabilities more readily use the technology. Student programmers produced apps and performed usability tests with the dementia patients, as well as met with geriatric facility personnel to produce application software that meets the patients, family, and caregiver needs and expectations. For example, a student term project produced an application entitled Candoo that utilizes Google's voice recognition and synthesis engine to navigate the web, provide the weather, and supply pill reminder alerts. Another application example included one that allows families to electronically send photographs, video clips, and favorite music from anywhere to loved ones for enjoyment. Furthermore, older adults were assessed by nursing students for cognitive functioning before, and after the semester's intervention. Such mobile apps could allow dementia persons to become less agitated and stay in their homes longer, while also providing awareness and positive change of attitude by those of another generation towards the elderly. This research will discuss student developed mobile applications in the scope of helping improve the quality of life of patients with AD or dementia.",,Electronic:978-1-4673-6245-0; POD:978-1-4673-6244-3,10.1109/LISAT.2013.6578252,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6578252,Accessibility;Aged User;Assistive Technologyies;Computer Science Education;Elderly;Older Adults;Senior Citizen;Software Engineering;Sundowning,Animals;Dementia;Mobile communication;Sociology;Statistics;Tablet computers,cognition;diseases;geriatrics;handicapped aids;mobile computing;patient treatment;speech recognition;speech synthesis,AD;Alzheimer patients;Candoo;Google voice recognition;Google voice synthesis engine;US healthcare system;caregiver anecdotes;cognitive abilities;cognitive functioning;geriatric facilities;iPads;iPods;mobile app development;music;nonverbal late-stage dementia patients;older adults;photographs;service-learning courses;student programmers;tablet application;usability research;usability tests;video clips,,5.0,,19.0,,,,3-3 May 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,software engineering accessibility education,5

Therefore, we have developed a first set of EDA tools that handle cell placement and wiring, written in SKILL, the Cadence scripting language. Our tools also consider the maximum wire length constraint that exists in AQFP logic. First, AQFP logic cells are repositioned via the genetic algorithm to minimize the number of wires that violate the wiring length constraint. Buffers are then automatically inserted as signal repeaters for logic rows where the violations still exist. We then complete the logic wiring of the circuit using the channel routing algorithm.

One is using automatic static analysis tools. We have observed, however, that despite the low-cost help they offer, these tools areunderused and often discourage beginners. There is evidence that personality traits influence the perceived usability of a software. Thus, to support beginners better, we need to understand how theworkflow of people with different prevalent personality traits using these tools varies. For this purpose, we observed users' solution strategies and correlated them with their prevalent personality traits in an exploratory study with student participants within a controlled experiment. We gathered data by screen capturing and chat protocols as well as a Big Five personality traits test.

The main concept behind this project is to setup the interface for rapid interaction design. Eye tracking is a powerful tool for hands free communication but for that requires a dedicated software. This software is rarely tailored for a specific needs of a potential user. It means that people who wants to explore gaze driven computer interfaces often need to create their own eye tracking software or need to have certain computer skills to be able to go through the software development kit (SDK) provided by the eye tracker vendors. It makes designing interaction by gaze quite challenging. The eGlasses eye tracking module was used to extend sensor values available in Scratch by the information about pupil position, gaze position and eye opened/eye closed signal. In this paper we have tested if the gaze data acquired by the eGlasses are reliable and can be used as an input signal for rapid interaction design using Scratch. The whole interface was validated regarding the system usability score (SUS). The purpose of our work is to support disabled children and their therapists but also to give a chance to a wider community, without computational skills, to easily check they ideas for gaze based interaction.

As a consequence, examinations as well as didactical approaches need to become competence-oriented. Unfortunately, competence-oriented examinations and assessments of the efficacy of didactical approaches are fairly hard - currently, no generally accepted approaches for competence-oriented evaluation are available. To make things worse, software engineering is a complex subject matter. Therefore, intended learning outcomes in software engineering education also tend to be quite complex and vary widely with a course's context. This paper provides details on how SECAT, a Software Engineering Competence Assessment Tool, is used to assess the efficacy of didactical approaches in software engineering education in a competence-oriented matter. To that end, SECAT needs to be adapted to the specific context, namely a particular didactical approach with its associated intended learning outcomes. Intended learning outcomes are related to specific competences, including non-technical skills. The paper presents results from applying SECAT for assessing the efficacy of employed didactical approaches in several software engineering courses. Furthermore, the paper shows an example of how SECAT's assessment results are used to improve didactical approaches for upcoming instances of these courses.

In recent years, various software assignment techniques have been designed to introduce heterogeneity into network hosts for the maximum network survivability. However, few work consider practical constraints involved in the software assignment process. To close such a gap, in this work we model the software assignment problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, which incorporates several real-world criteria simultaneously, including network survivability, system feasibility and usability. To solves this multi-objective problem efficiently, we propose an ant colony optimization (ACO) based algorithm, where colonies of artificial ants work collaboratively through both heuristic information and pheromone-mediated communication to iteratively search for better solutions. To validate the generalizability of the proposed method, we experiment our algorithm on various types of network topologies with different parameter settings.

Web conference offers the opportunity for the participants in the distance learning environment to be brought into a joint virtual environment regardless of their location, and also offers interactive and collaborative possibilities which facilitate the process of acquiring collective knowledge. The paper presents the comparison of mostly used web conferencing tools nowadays, based on several criteria: functionality, security, software installation, meeting setup and usability. Main aim of this paper was to evaluate the effectiveness of using web conference in teaching programming, for face-to-face and blended learning students. Web conference lectures were applied in the class on four out of ten courses in total, in the second year of the studies. The summative analysis of the pass rate and the average mark for both groups of students has been carried out in these courses. Then the results that the students achieved in the courses where the web conference was used were compared to the results that they achieved in the courses where the web conference was not used. Based on students' evaluation, the paper also presents formative analysis of efficiency and usefulness in using web conference in the class.

Once the phone is locked, the user should take a specific action or provide some secret information to unlock the phone. The existing unlocking approaches can be categorized into four groups: motion, password, pattern, and fingerprint. Existing approaches do not support smart phones well due to the deficiency of security, high cost, and poor usability. We collect 200 users' handwaving actions with their smart phones and discover an appealing observation: the waving pattern of a person is kind of unique, stable and distinguishable. In this paper, we propose OpenSesame, which employs the users' waving patterns for locking/unlocking. The key feature of our system lies in using four fine-grained and statistic features of handwaving to verify users. Moreover, we utilize support vector machine (SVM) for accurate and fast classification. Our technique is robust compatible across different brands of smart phones, without the need of any specialized hardware. Results from comprehensive experiments show that the mean false positive rate of OpenSesame is around 15 percent, while the false negative rate is lower than 8 percent.",1536-1233;15361233,,10.1109/TMC.2014.2341633,Central Universities of China; Doctoral Program of Higher Education; 10.13039/501100001809 - NSFC; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6862001,Smart phone;accelerometer;authentication;privacy;security,Accelerometers;Intelligent sensors;Magnetic sensors;Mobile computing;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Smart phones,biometrics (access control);message authentication;smart phones;support vector machines,OpenSesame;SVM;false positive rate;fine-grained feature;handwaving action;handwaving biometrics;screen locking;screen unlocking;secret information;smart phone;statistic feature;support vector machine;waving pattern,,6.0,,23.0,,,20140722.0,May 1 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,software engineering usability education,11

Hendradjaya,"Sekolah Teknik Elektro dan Informatika, Institut Teknologi Bandung, Bandung, Indonesia",2014 International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (ICEECS),20150219.0,2014,,,223,228,"The process of blended learning system gives benefits in terms of cost-effectiveness and easy interaction between students and teachers. One of the strategies is to implement the asynchronous type of interaction. An online activity in blended learning using e-learning models is known as a Learning Management System (LMS). Currently LMS has been widely applied in the educational process in higher education institutions. To assess the results of the application of the LMS, we need a quality model that can be referenced by developers of LMS. This study developed a model for the application of quality in an asynchronous blended learning system The model allows an LMS can be evaluated by a party who is not an expert in the field of software technology, especially for the users, who is usually not involved in the system development phase directly. This model is expected to be a reference for both by the developers and users. In this study, the quality of the application the model is applied based on ISO/IEC 9126. This model supports the evaluation of two primary requirements, the needs of virtual communication and the delivery of educational activities, which has seven features, namely: discussion boards, e-mail, blogs, lectures, assignments, quizzes and grades. The quality characteristics in this model, among others are the suitability of implementation, ease of procedures, flexibility (interaction, tests and learner control), user security permissions, as well as response time, availability, reliability and completeness of the system. So the quality factor is proposed functionality (suitability, accurattime behavioreness, security), reliability (maturity), usability (learnability) and efficiency (time behavior). The proposed model was validated with a case study of LMS in the Politeknik Caltex Riau (LMS PCR). The results have shown that the model could offer a quality evaluation of LMS PCR. The model has been able to demonstrate that the LMS PCR was conformed to the re- uirements of an asynchronous blended learning system.",,CD-ROM:978-1-4799-8477-0; Electronic:978-1-4799-8478-7; POD:978-1-4799-8479-4,10.1109/ICEECS.2014.7045251,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045251,ISO/IEC 9126;asynchronous;blended learning;learning management system,Electronic learning;IEC standards;ISO standards;Least squares approximations;Q-factor;Security;Time factors,computer aided instruction;educational institutions;further education,ISO/IEC 9126;LMS;LMS PCR;LMS in the Politeknik Caltex Riau;application model;asynchronous blended learning system;e-learning models;educational activities;educational process;higher education institutions;learning management system quality;online activity;quality model;software technology;virtual communication,,0.0,,37.0,,,,24-25 Nov. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,software engineering usability education,5

We visited seven different organizations and observed and interviewed their members. Each organization was chosen to provide an overall picture of Eclipse use throughout the industry. The results decompose the appropriation of Eclipse by software developers in organizations into four categories: learning, tailoring and discovering, as well as the cross-cutting category: collaboration. The categories are grounded in situations that provoked a need to change as well as in policies adopted for coping with this need.

Although such laboratories have the benefit of allowing students to learn from mistakes without damaging remote equipment, student learning can be limited by denying them access to real data from real equipment. The primary contribution of this article is to outline the development of several mobile apps for interacting with real physical test beds in an automatic control laboratory, both in the laboratory and remotely. Results are provided from a preliminary investigation of the usability and user experience associated with the applications, using students who would ultimately be the users of the applications when they are integrated into the curriculum.

66,106,Using Intelligent Tutors to Teach Students How APIs Are Used for Software Engineering in Practice,V. Krishnamoorthy; B. Appasamy; C. Scaffidi,"School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Oregon State University",IEEE Transactions on Education,20130731.0,2013,56.0,3.0,355,363,"Computer science courses typically incorporate integrated training in software engineering, which includes learning how to reuse existing code libraries in new programs. This commonly presents a need to use the libraries' application programming interfaces (APIs) during project-based learning activities. The students learn these APIs with little support from the instructor. Instead, they primarily learn from whatever code examples they find on the Web-a scattershot approach that is slow, frustrating, and sometimes fruitless. Preliminary work investigated an improved approach that provides students with intelligent API tutors. This interactive educational content walks students through code examples selectively harvested from the Web. This approach increased students' knowledge of API method names, but a key pedagogical challenge remained: Students still lacked an understanding of common problems and surprises that they might encounter when using APIs in practice. Perhaps even more crucially, the prior statistical study provided no information about how students would perceive and accept the intelligent tutor approach, when given a choice. Therefore, this paper presents an enhanced approach that augments intelligent tutors with selected information from online FAQs and online open-source code, thereby providing more explanation and context about how to use APIs in practice. A qualitative study assessed student perceptions of the system's usability as well as suggestions for improvement, revealing that 100% of students considered the approach to be useful. A key implication is that providing information from online FAQs, related articles, and open-source code could facilitate computer science students' learning how to use APIs.",0018-9359;00189359,,10.1109/TE.2013.2238543,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6422340,Application programming interface (API);computer science education;electronic learning;software engineering;software libraries,Computer science;Industries;Libraries;Open source software;Software engineering;Training,Internet;application program interfaces;computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;public domain software;software libraries;statistical analysis;teaching,API tutors;Web;application programming interfaces;computer science courses;computer science student learning;instructor;intelligent tutors;interactive educational content;online FAQ;online open source code;project-based learning activities;software engineering;system usability;teaching,,3.0,,37.0,,,20130128.0,Aug. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,software engineering usability education,8

In addition, lecturers might not be able to explain the subject effectively due to many factors. This research aims to justify and investigate more aspects to support the understanding of object-oriented concepts through games. Game is one of the approaches that could attract students' attention and increases their focus in learning object-oriented theory and practice. This paper reports a feasibility study using a controlled experiment that investigated the effect of using games in learning object-oriented programming among Computer Science students.

However, in recent years it has also evolved as a multitasking tool to promote asynchronous learning among students. Malaysia as an education hub regularly draws large numbers of foreign students to pursue transfer degree programs here. It is observed that these students from various continents of the world have different perceptions on learning due to their cultural differences. Therefore, an e-learning platform is required to facilitate asynchronous learning. This paper explores the transfer students' usage pattern of a typical e-learning tool: Course Management Software (CMS) or commonly known as Blackboard in tertiary education. Though e-learning have provided fascinating multitasking tools, very limited attention is paid to transfer students' perceptions and the frequency of usage of the e-learning system. Therefore, a case study was conducted in an e-learning environment, on the usability of selected tools in CMS. Results of the research demonstrated that large percentage of students had very positive perceptions of certain e-learning tools and the frequency of usage of CMS is high; with vast majority of students using it frequently.

The point of view in our report is the usability of Delphi in collecting qualitative data for software engineering research. The most significant features of the Delphi method are its recursion and the possibility to get immediate feedback and evaluate one's own answer. Although there are many forms of Delphi techniques, these features exist in one form or the other in all Delphi variations. In Delphi-based surveys, the minimum number of participants is smaller and participants are not selected at random but because of their particular expertise. Among the traditional research methods this is seen to cause the risk of bias and endangering both reliability and validity. In the Delphi method, the recursion produced by three or more rounds, the expertise and - in most cases - anonymity of participants, and the opportunity to evaluate and argue one's own answer after having seen the other opinions and arguments are thought to guarantee the quality of well-planned and well-conducted research.",2159-5100;21595100,Electronic:978-1-890843-23-6; POD:978-1-4577-1552-5; USB:978-1-890843-24-3,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6017716,,Business;Cultural differences;Education;Instruments;Reliability theory;Sampling methods,philosophical aspects;social aspects of automation;software reliability,Delphi method;Delphi techniques;Delphi-based surveys;philosophical aspect;reliability aspect;software engineering research;validity aspect,,1.0,,26.0,,,,July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,software engineering usability education,9

Box 43844-00100, Nairobi, Kenya",2017 IST-Africa Week Conference (IST-Africa),20171109.0,2017,,,1,11,"Constructivism approach to learning is known to support multiple perspectives in interpretations of reality, knowledge construction and context rich, experience based activities. Technology comes in handy to offer incredible amounts of information and tools for creativity and development as well as diverse environments and communication forums where students can build knowledge in an engaged setting. However, technophobia has been reported among teachers as inhibiting integration of technology in the classroom. Teachers feel confident about their knowledge of the pedagogy. They are also confident about their knowledge of the content but less confident when it comes to technology knowledge. There are many models of instruction informed by constructivist theories to implement technology into teaching. These models do not demonstrate how a teacher can develop a lesson plan using the Constructivist Learning Perspective and integrate technology in the plan particularly using SAMR Model of technology integration. This paper explores how technology can be used to complement constructivism approach to learning as part of building teacher's confidence in using technology in the classroom. This will be possible through developing a lesson plan and using the Substitution Augmentation Modification Redefinition Model (SAMR) technology integration model. Fifteen (15) PhD students taking a course in education in May-August 2016 were engaged in developing a lesson plan based on constructivism approach to learning and they were required to use SAMR model of ICT integration in order to demonstrate how technology complements constructivism. The SMAR supports and allows trainers and teachers to plan, develop, and infuse learning experiences that utilize technology in their teaching. Specific practices in the lesson plan that specified tasks to be done using cognitive terminology such as classify, analyze, predict and create, coupled with various levels of technology integration model- enabled students to explore learning.",,POD:978-1-5386-3837-8,10.23919/ISTAFRICA.2017.8102351,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8102351,Constructivism;Lesson plan;SMAR technology integration Model,Buildings;Computers;Education;Electronic mail;Planning;Tools,,,,,,,,,,May 30 2017-June 2 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,information technology education theory,10

Hussin,"Department of Information Systems, State Islamic University (UIN) Syarif Hidayatullah, Jakarta, Indonesia",2016 International Conference on Informatics and Computing (ICIC),20170424.0,2016,,,221,226,"Information Technology (IT) innovation implementation in an organization seems to be more challenging than expected. IT innovation adoption is relatively controllable, while the investigating way of work of IT implementation is far more difficult to control as it involves complex interactions among individuals, technology, and the environment. Similar to other organizations, higher educational institutions are also involved in IT innovation implementation. IT innovation is seen as key enabler to transform higher education, nevertheless many IT implementation initiatives are far from successful. This study proposed an IT innovation effectiveness model for higher education and investigates what are the factors that contribute to IT innovation effectiveness. The proposed model was based on the post adoption stage of Diffusion of Innovation theory and Klein and Sorra's innovation implementation model. The model was adapted to the higher education context by including new variables. Using the survey method, the model was validated using a sample of 91 higher educational institutions in Indonesia. The findings of the study confirmed that top management support (TMS) influence successful IT innovation effectiveness (ITNE) both directly and indirectly through implementation policies and practices (IPP) of ITNE. Consequently, top management bodies in the context of the HEIs in Indonesia should prioritize on IPP first. This will enable implementation policies to influence on successful ITNE. In a similar manner, the role of IPP is very important as mediator of the relationship between TMS and ITNE to achieve success of ITNE.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-1648-8; POD:978-1-5090-1649-5,10.1109/IAC.2016.7905719,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7905719,Higher Education Institutions;IT Implementation;IT innovation;Organizational innovation;UIN Jakarta,Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Education;Informatics;Meteorology;Organizations;Technological innovation,educational administrative data processing;further education;social aspects of automation,HEI;IT innovation effectiveness model;Indonesia;TMS;diffusion of innovation theory;higher education institutions;information technology innovation effectiveness;top management support,,,,,,,,28-29 Oct. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,information technology education theory,5

While the focus in the past was on how to improve the organizations, the current dynamics render the old methods unusable. What is needed are the methods to support the inter-personal communication and productivity in order to maintain a higher level of knowledge entropy that can eventually lead to increase in new ideas. This paper presents a vision of a virtual space of networked individuals, based on Virtual & Augmented Reality, forming ad-hoc groups on the basis of common interests. The basic idea is how to connect people and concepts together, what methods to use, and how to make the collaboration and the exchange of information more fluent and easier to handle. Important issues like how to link collaborative resources together or how to discover new resources within the population of a virtual community and browsing through the people-concepts maps, within a VAR environment, are discussed. A possible platform to stimulate creativity and innovation is envisaged. The paper looks into later collaborative environments and their benefits into providing much faster and broader access to existing knowledge and people know-how, thus providing more tools and new technologies to professionals engaged into knowledge intensive work. New concepts like Augmented Reality are proposed as alternative environment for deploying applications supporting the individual and group collaboration work. The new framework is described and a plan for setting a small empirical study is analysed covering the issues of interaction and collaboration in education and training. This paper is trying to find the methods that can be used first for the evaluation and later for deployment of new tools and techniques that will improve the creativity and innovation within online collaboration s- ssions. The benefits of the research include providing more supportive, appealing and communicative applications by applying various design theories and practices into virtual enterprise system development.

Proper implementation of a flipped classroom is difficult to gauge, but combines successful techniques for distance education with constructivist learning theory in the classroom. While flipped classrooms are not a novel concept, technological advances and increased comfort with distance learning have made the tools to produce and consume course materials more pervasive. Flipped classroom experiments have had both positive and less-positive results and are generally measured by a significant improvement in learning outcomes.

This paper, based on empirical research, examines the educational and social uses of mobile telecommunication services by first-year Information Technology (IT) students at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The study provides insight into the usage of mobile telecommunication services for different academic and social activities from students' perceptions. The study identifies some factors that influence the adoption and usage of mobile phones in education. Students' use of mobile telecommunications services is analyzed using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the theory of planned behaviour.",,Electronic:978-1-9083-2038-4; POD:978-1-4799-7822-9; USB:978-1-9083-2036-0,10.1109/i-Society.2014.7009013,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009013,TAM;UKZN;academic activities;fist-year IT students;mobile telecomunication services;social activities,Educational institutions;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Sociology;Statistics;Telecommunication services,computer science education;educational institutions;mobile handsets;mobile learning;social aspects of automation;social networking (online);telecommunication services,South African University;TAM;University of KwaZulu-Natal;academic activities;communication modes;educational purposes;educational usage;educational uses;first-year IT students;first-year information technology students;information and communication technologies;mobile phones adoption;mobile phones usage;mobile technology;mobile telecommunication networks;mobile telecommunication services usage;new generation mobile phones;planned behaviour theory;social activities;social interactions;social networks;social usage;social uses;students perceptions;technology acceptance model,,0.0,,17.0,,,,10-12 Nov. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,information technology education theory,5
17,41,Mobile learning-system usage: An integrated framework to measure students' behavioural intention,S. Alharbi; S. Drew,"School of ICT, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Australia Shaqra University, Saudi Arabia",2014 Science and Information Conference,20141009.0,2014,,,906,911,"Mobile technologies have changed the shape of learning for learners, society, and education providers. Consequently, mobile learning has become a core component in modern education. Nevertheless, introducing mobile learning systems does not automatically guarantee that learners will develop a positive behavioural intention to use it and therefore use it. Thus, acceptance-of-technology and system-success studies have increased. As yet, however, much of the research regarding understanding students' behavioural intention to use mobile learning systems seems to suffer from several shortcomings. On top of that, there is no common cognitive theoretical foundation. This study introduces a theoretical framework that combines the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and information system (IS) success model. This integration resulted in three success measures and two acceptance constructs. The success measures included the following: a) information quality, b) system quality, and c) user satisfaction; whilst the following were the acceptance measures: a) effort expectancy, b) performance expectancy, and c) social influence. Further, this study introduces lecture attitude as a new construct that is believed to moderate students' behavioural intention. The relationships between the different factors form the research hypotheses.",,CD-ROM:978-0-9893-1932-4; Electronic:978-0-9893193-1-7; POD:978-1-4799-3981-7,10.1109/SAI.2014.6918294,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918294,Higher education;IS Success;Mobile learning;UTAUT,Context;Educational institutions;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Portable computers;Predictive models,computer aided instruction;further education,IS success model;UTAUT;acceptance measures;acceptance-of-technology;education providers;effort expectancy;information quality;information system;mobile learning-system;mobile technology;performance expectancy;positive behavioural intention;social influence;student behavioural intention measurement;system quality;system-success study;unified theory of acceptance and use of technology;user satisfaction,,0.0,,46.0,,,,27-29 Aug. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,information technology education theory,5

The current higher education system cannot satisfy this need in many fields, e.g. Gartner predicts, that already in 2015 only a third of jobs for big data analysts can be filled [2]. The rapid development of Information and Communication Technology (ITC, IT) has changed many aspects of teaching and learning. Educational materials are moving into cloud(s) and degrees are given on-line (`Master's Degree Online Directory' lists over 90,000 programs [3]), old-fashioned Colleges and Universities with large campus, staff and high costs are getting more and more competition from numerous educational entrepreneurs, who start massive open online courses (MOOC) with millions of users/students from all around the world; they establish new on-line universities where costs of obtaining a degree are marginal compared to `brick-and-mortal' universities and which are open to nearly everyone independent of user geographical location. Until now MOOC have not yet proved their value-less than 4% of enrollees complete the courses [4] and they do not receive (yet) university diploma. But the World most prestigious technical university, MIT, has already set up a certification system - students who can master the subjects taught in MOOC receive an official certificate of completion [5]. Although these certificates will not carry the weight of a traditional MIT diploma (they will be issued by started by MIT online learning initiative called MITx), but the word `MIT' alone carries a weight. When speaking about possibilities of IT in education most speakers/writers are excitedly discussing technology-servers, communication lines, bandwidth, security (preferably all in thick cloud of technical jargon). Nearly nobody presents practical experience, suggestions and/or theories about how to teach with this new technology in order best to utilize its possibilities. The `educati- n in the cloud' mainly consists of video clips trying to repeat the classroom experience: recorded before the old-fashioned blackboard (only nowadays it is white), where professor is presenting the same lecture what he presented in lecture hall, only now lectures are cut into 5-10 min video clips - the `mobile approach'. Is this why the old lecture halls are still needed? Rapidly increasing costs of University Education, increasing competition of educational entrepreneurs and constant increase of population of working students have made clear, that both sides of University education - teaching/learning and accrediting, giving diplomas need changes. University Education should more take into account students informal and non-formal learning, their participation in professional work - both in organization of study and in certification. In the following are considered several aspects of current situation, presented practices which authors use when teaching IT students and examined possible changes in universities teaching and certification methods.",,CD-ROM:978-953-233-081-6; Electronic:978-953-233-077-9; POD:978-1-4799-5657-9,10.1109/MIPRO.2014.6859641,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6859641,,Clouds;Computers;Educational institutions;Materials;Three-dimensional displays;Tutorials,certification;cloud computing;computer aided instruction;educational institutions;further education;mobile computing;teaching,IT student teaching;ITC;MIT diploma;MOOC;c-learning;certification system;communication lines;e-learning;education in the cloud;educational entrepreneurs;educational materials;higher education system;informal learning;information and communication technology;m-learning;massive open online courses;mobile approach;nonformal learning;old-fashioned colleges;online universities;postsecondary education;professional work;security;technical university;technology-servers;university education;video clips,,2.0,,67.0,,,,26-30 May 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,information technology education theory,6

Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden",2014 International Conference on Teaching and Learning in Computing and Engineering,20140602.0,2014,,,1,8,"Previous research in STEM education demonstrates that students are engaged in a continuous process of identity development, trying to integrate their educational experiences with their perception of who they are, and who they wish to become. It appears increasingly apparent from this body of research that students are not well supported in this process by the education they currently receive. The goal of this paper is to analyse a specific aspect of the student experience, participation, in order to gain a better understanding of how computer science (CS) and information technology (IT) students engage with CS prior to and during their studies. Drawing on student interview data we describe and discuss students' qualitatively different ways of experiencing participation in CS and IT. The notion of participation applied here is inspired by Wenger's notion of participation in his social theory of learning. A phenomenographic analysis identifies a spectrum of qualitatively distinct ways in which the students experience participation in CS and IT, ranging from ""using"", to participation as ""continuous development"", and ""creating new knowledge"".",,Electronic:978-1-4799-3592-5; POD:978-1-4799-3593-2; USB:978-1-4799-3591-8,10.1109/LaTiCE.2014.9,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821819,Computer Science;IT;engagement;identity;meaning;participation;perception of the discipline,Computers;Educational institutions;Hardware;Interviews;Programming,computer science education;educational technology,CS;IT students experience;STEM education;educational experience;first year computer science;identity development;information technology;phenomenographic analysis,,4.0,,21.0,,,,11-13 April 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,information technology education theory,7

EKC, Eger, Hungary",2013 IEEE 63rd Annual Conference International Council for Education Media (ICEM),20140526.0,2013,,,1,9,"These days the European Union is forced to contend with a serious shortage of info-communication experts. According to the prediction of the European Commission in 2015 this sector will be lacking 900 000 professionals. While annually more than 100 000 jobs or employment opportunities are created by the ICT industry, there is a lag in relevant professionals.? (Nemzetko?zi o?sszefoga?s az it-s szakemberhia?ny ellen, 2013) Moreover, this trend is not only impacting Europe as in 2006 58 000 work visas were available in America for ICT professionals. (McCormack, 2010) Although it has become clear that only education can provide an effective answer to the problem of the lack of professional experts, only business firms offer IT and ICT related training opportunities and higher education institutions do not provide programs aiming to meet relevant employer demands. Consequently, any improvement of the present situation requires a familiarity with the concept of ICT along with an overview of is history and continually increasing role in the education process. Thus the present effort aims to answer the following questions: As a direct connection can be established between ICT and Information Technology, since when can ICT be considered as an educational tool? What did the conceptual system of ICT replace? How did ICT supersede the concept of Educational Technology? Can ICT be merely viewed as an all-round education tool, or there is more to its application? ?Educational tools or devices are objects, materials, instruments and technological equipment, facilitating the realization of pedagogical goals and vigorously promoting the school-based learning process, specific knowledge acquisition efforts and the direct (in some cases indirect) familiarization with reality via their capability of transmitting, recording, and storing information in an effective way.? (Fodor, 2008) Since when has ICT fulfilled such roles in the - ducation process? ?The application of information and communication technology in education primarily manifests itself in a cybernetic, system in addition to a communication theory based planning and organization strategy of the learning and information acquisition process guaranteeing the optimalization of the accessibility and the reception of information with the use of modern information carriers, methodologies, and technologies.? (Kis-To?th, 2008. p.3.) The present research effort focused on the total spectrum of articles published in full textual form between 2000 and 2010 in the periodical titled Educational Media International. Frequency analysis or computerized content analysis, a branch of quantitative content analysis was the main research method. The main goal of the inquiry was not to perform a statistical analysis on the totality of expressions, rather an examination of the occurrence of such terms as ?Information and Communication Technology,? ?Information Technology,? ?IT,? and ?ICT.? Consequently, the research samples consist of the words of the text, or ?mutually independent components of the source language flow.? (Krippendorff, 1960, p.60) The research effort includes the investigation of the textual context of the aforementioned terms via the standard keyword in context (KWIC) method providing a report on the terms:?Information and Communication Technology,? ?Information Technology,? ?IT,? and ?ICT.? It is expected that the research will facilitate the determination of the proliferation time of the given expression, which due to the unique nature of the respective periodical can be dated from the time when education started to provide a response to the challenge of technological development.

The theoretical and methodological approach underpinning the study is Constructivist, Contextual and Meaningful (Construcionista, Contextualizada e Significativa - CCS), making use of input from the studies of Papert, Valente, Schlu?nzen, Almeida and others, which presuppose valuing different ways of teaching and learning by using the TDIC. These ways of teaching imply a reorganization of pedagogical practice through the development of skills and promotion of strategies where all students (including those with disabilities), have the right of access and to stay in school, learning with quality. UNESP is committed to the training of elementary school teachers and, along with the Universidade Virtual do Estado de Sa?o Paulo (UNIVESP), offers Degrees in Pedagogy UNIVESP / UNESP, and is currently training 1004 (one thousand and four) teachers working in basic education in the state of Sa?o Paulo. Held in a semipresential modality, the course curriculum is organized in modules and themes / disciplines from broad areas of undergraduate training. There are Articulator Axes in these modules and, among these, the Articulator Axis: Inclusive and Special Education - 120 hours/class (linked to Block 2: Didactic of Contents). The focus of this research is directed to the preparation and monitoring of the development of this articulator axis. The research questions are: Is it possible, in the process of training teachers in a course of semipresential- Pedagogy, to guide them to work using TDIC in a CCS approach to generate an inclusive school? How does the Articulator Axis enable teachers to apply the knowledge constructed in this context? In order to answer these questions, the general goal is to analyze the process of teacher training aimed at teaching the fundamentals of Inclusive Education in a perspective of working with TDIC projects using a CCS approach. The methodological nature is of a qualitative intervention type, and the subjects of semipresential training comprise a sample of 160 students from the UNIVESP / UNESP Degree in Pedagogy and 8 guiding discipline (tutors responsible for 4 classes where students are enrolled). Analysis of preliminary data available in the Virtual Learning Environments of selected classes indicate that the discussion on curricular and teaching strategies was expanded in the development of Articulator Axis; students developed plans for inclusive education in transdisciplinary perspectives and began to look further into such issues as the use of TDIC and working with cross-cutting themes, namely, meanings attributed to theory and practice. It is expected that it will be possible to characterize the effective contributions of the proposal and the impacts of the development of inclusive education plans, by the end of the study, featuring not only an approach to teaching but also to CCS training.",,Electronic:978-1-4799-3216-0; POD:978-1-4799-2753-1,10.1109/CICEM.2013.6820172,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820172,Constructionist;Contextual and Meaningful Approach;Teacher Training,Conferences;Context;Councils;Educational institutions;Media;Training,educational courses;teacher training;teaching,TDIC;UNESP;articulator axis;communication digital technology;constructivist;contructionist;course curriculum;cross-cutting themes;distance education;doctoral thesis;inclusive education plans;inclusive school;information digital technology;pedagogical practice;pedagogy UNIVESP;semipresential pedagogy;semipresential training;teacher formation;teacher training;teaching strategies;virtual learning environments,,0.0,,38.0,,,,1-4 Oct. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,information technology education theory,10

SDL and CoL are the goals for Singapore's Ministry of Education Information and Communication Technology Masterplan 3. Wikis were used in the project to support reflection and communication within groups. Five classes consisting of 181 Secondary Two students from a Singapore secondary school were involved in this project. The participants were selected based on their mandatory involvement in an integrated 5-month project initiated by the school. As the participation in the study was voluntary, 144 of the 181 students responded. Sixty nine of the students had no prior experience with wikis. Among the 75 students who had prior experience, most of them used wikis to obtain information while 46 of them shared information using wikis and 51 of them used it to work on collaborative projects with others. The variance explained by Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) was 32.4 percent. The results showed that performance expectancy and facilitating condition were found to have a significant relationship with behavioural intention; while effort expectancy and social influence did not, contrary to many prior studies. Modifying the original UTAUT to include three other factors, attitude, trust and comfort level increased the variance explained to 37 percent. However, trust and comfort level were found to have a significant relationship with behavioural intention in the modified UTAUT. This study contributes to UTAUT's theoretical validity and empirical applicability and to the management of technology based initiatives in education.

However, mobile telecommunications offer various services that interest young people. These services are used to create and maintain social interactions while also relying on it for educational purposes. This paper is based on empirical research to examine the academic and social uses of mobile telecommunication services by first-year Information Technology (IT) students at Lagos State University, Nigeria (LASU). Students' use of mobile telecommunications services is analyzed using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the theory of planned behaviour. The study identifies challenges that could affect the use of mobile telecommunication services and it also pinpoints some factors that influence the acceptance and usage of mobile phones in education. The analysis enables the understanding of the significance of the variables and their influences on students' perceptions. The significance of these factors as well as limitation of the study was ascertained.

This assumes a degree of literacy with ICT (information and communication technology) amongst potential students, who are often regarded as digital natives. Far from being digital natives, many students have considerable trouble using ICT beyond the ubiquitous Facebook. While some students are computer literate, a substantial proportion lack the skills to prosper under their own devices in an online tertiary education environment. For these students a blended learning experience is needed to develop skills to effectively interact in the virtual environment. This paper presents a case study that specifically examines the ICT capabilities of first-year university students enrolled in the School of Civil Engineering and the Built Environment at Queensland University of Technology (QUT) through the lens of the theory of planned behaviour.

Taiwan Normal Univ., Taipei, Taiwan",2013 IEEE 37th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference Workshops,20130923.0,2013,,,391,396,"Due to limited budgets and manpower, most elementary schools in Taiwan do not plan or provide library instruction for students. Although students can use libraries, they typically lack the knowledge needed to use library resources effectively. Consequently, students have difficulty finding the books they need and can easily become overwhelmed by the massive amount of information in libraries. Computer-assisted instruction for teaching basic library skills to large numbers of students is an appealing method. Particularly, game-based learning has garnered considerable attention in education research. Many researchers and scholars believe that integrating teaching and games enhances student learning performance and motivation. This work develops an educational gaming system based on situated learning theory, and applies innovative augmented reality interactive technology to a library's learning environment. Student library knowledge can be enhanced via the proposed game-based augmented reality library instruction system (GARLIS). Experimental results demonstrate that student learning performance is improved significantly by using the proposed GARLIS. Moreover, this work demonstrates that using the proposed GARLIS for library instruction results in the same learning performance as conventional librarian instruction. The proposed library instruction system overcomes shortcomings of personal teaching skills of librarians that may adversely affect student learning performance by conveying the same learning content to all students. Additionally, the proposed system results in better learning performance for learners with the field-dependent cognitive style than learners with the field-independent cognitive style. Further, the proposed system provides more benefits in terms of library skills training than conventional librarian instruction.",,Electronic:978-1-4799-2159-1; POD:978-1-4799-2160-7,10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.128,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6605822,augmented reality;human-computer interface;library instruction;media in education,Augmented reality;Educational institutions;Games;Libraries;Testing;Three-dimensional displays,augmented reality;computer based training;computer games;educational institutions;information science education;libraries;teaching,GARLIS;Taiwan;computer-assisted instruction;educational gaming system;elementary schools;field-dependent cognitive style;field-independent cognitive style;game-based learning;innovative augmented reality interactive technology;interactive game-based augmented reality library instruction system;library instruction;library resources;library skill teaching;library skills training;situated learning theory;student learning motivation;student learning performance,,4.0,,13.0,,,,22-26 July 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,information technology education theory,5

Analyzing 300 support service interactions at three points in time and with two applications, we identified five categories of customer-oriented citizenship behavior by IS support personnel, including anticipation, education, justification, personalization-technology and personalization-business. Moreover, different types of OCB were found dominant across three periods, starting with the justification OCB and gradually shifting to anticipation and education OCB. Results from this study demonstrate the value of customer-oriented citizenship behavior in IS context.

The research question posed in this study is: Do national policy initiatives, regulatory measures, or governance practices increase a nation's mobile broadband diffusion? There is little research that has analyzed the impact of these factors on bridging the mobile broadband digital divide in highly developed or developing countries. Our empirical findings show that when controlling for measures of wealth, education and other factors, there is greater mobile broadband diffusion in countries that encourage competition in their broader telecommunications sector and practice sound regulation. In countries where open competition allows alternative ICTs to compete with each other, the presence of more expensive alternative telecommunication services also increases mobile broadband diffusion. Although theory suggests that sound regulation and sound governance should both positively affect mobile diffusion, we observe where this theory breaks down in practice. Specifically, outliers in our data set show that a few countries have achieved high levels mobile broadband adoption even though they face significant problems with corruption in their government.",1530-1605;15301605,Electronic:978-1-5090-5646-0; POD:978-1-4673-5933-7; USB:978-0-7695-4892-0,10.1109/HICSS.2013.583,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6480188,,Broadband communication;Indexes;Internet;Investment;Mobile communication;Standards;Telecommunications,,,,0.0,,43.0,,,,7-10 Jan. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,information technology education theory,9

Millions of people are utilising them on a daily basis in order to share their experience, information and to communicate with their family members and friends. Lately, these technologies have been used to foster collaboration in education, however, it is a case of hit and miss and without established techniques to ensure or replicate success. A number of factors contribute to the limited success of such groups, one such factor is the presence of selfish members. A selfish user adopts a free riding behaviour that takes advantage of the collaborative group without contributing back. Such a behaviour will affect the group's sustainability and affect the participants willingness to contribute. To improve the survival of educational groups in social applications, free riding behaviour needs to be studied, its impact on the group survivability assessed and then addressed.

Today, screen reading software and Braille displays or text-to-speech systems have solved many problems of accessing text. For accessing graphics, and specifically digital graphics, there is to date no standardised technology that is accepted and used by blind people. Especially in school education, access to pictures is almost impossible to master; making teamwork very complicated and thus isolating blind students from their sighted peers making it impossible to acquire a shared understanding of school material.

Sharawy,"Department of computer Science, Faculty of computers, Benha University, Egypt",2010 International Computer Engineering Conference (ICENCO),20110224.0,2010,,,113,120,"Augmented Reality (AR) is the technology of adding virtual objects to the real scenes through enabling the addition of missing information at real life. As the lack of resources is a problem that can be solved through AR, this paper represents and explains the usage of AR technology in what can be named Augmented Reality Student Card (ARSC) for serving the education field. ARSC uses single static markers combined in one card for assigning different objects, leaving the choice to the computer application for minimizing the tracking process. ARSC is designed to be a useful low cost solution for serving the education field. ARSC represents any lesson in a 3D format that helps students to visualize the facts, interact with theories and deal with the information in a totally new effective and interactive way. ARSC can be used in offline, online and game applications with seven markers, four of them are used as a joystick game controller. One of the novelties in this paper is that full experimental tests had been made for the ARTag marker set for sorting them according to their efficiency. The results of the tests are used in this research to choose the most efficient markers for ARSC, and can be used for further researches. The experimental work that had been made in this paper also shows the constraints for marker creation for an AR application. Due to the need to work for online and offline application, merging of toolkits and libraries has been made, as presented in this paper. ARSC was examined by a number of students of both genders with average age between 10-17 years and it was found to have a great acceptance among them.",,Electronic:978-1-61284-185-4; POD:978-1-61284-184-7,10.1109/ICENCO.2010.5720437,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5720437,Augmented Reality;Computer Assisted Learning;Mixed Reality;Optical tracking,Cameras;Education;Lead;Navigation;Optical imaging;Productivity;Software,augmented reality;computer aided instruction;interactive devices;natural scenes,AR technology;ARSC;augmented reality student card;joystick game controller;real scenes;tracking process;virtual objects,,1.0,,18.0,,,,27-28 Dec. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,information technology education theory,7

However, the implementation of e-learning in technical disciplines (e.g. Robotics and Simulation) is still far behind the rapid growth of practice in narrative disciplines (e.g. Database and Theory of Computer Science). The perception is that technical discipline education is inevitable in laboratory exercises, and increases the complexity of e-learning implementation. Information Technology (IT) experts', lecturers' and technicians' expertise combines to create interactive virtual learning for technical disciplines as well as a physical laboratory experience with real equipment. To prove the feasibility of the concept, Robotic decided to represent a technical discipline in Computer Science. This subject has been taught in many higher education institutions to produce knowledgeable workers for industry. However, problems such as an unbalanced ratio of student-robots, high cost of robot mainconventionaltenance, high risk of robot improper operation are mainly occur in the conventional robotics learning. This project proposes virtual robotics learning. The goal of research is to enable virtual learning through e-learning platform for robot movements (direct and inverse kinematics), robot control (joint/manual and assigned coordinate) and MELFA Basic code.

But this advancement in information technology has further provoked the problems like plagiarism and other academic misconduct. This paper evaluates the patterns of use and behavior of tertiary level students towards the use of Web 2.0 as an alternative and supplemental eLearning Portal. A total of 92 students' data were collected and analyzed according to 'Self-Determination Theory' (SDT). It was found that students use social websites for chatting, gamming and sharing files. Facebook, YouTube and Wikipedia are ranked as the most popular websites used by college students. It also reveals that students have an inherent desire of expressing ideas and opinion online openly and independently. This sense of freedom makes students feel more competent, autonomous or participative and find learning to be less tedious. Therefore, this report, recommends educators to adopt strategies for acknowledging students' feelings and activities online to reinforce positive behavior effective learning.

A total of 18 in-depth interviews were conducted with key informants and analyzed using the techniques of grounded theory. Finally, we propose a technology-based service innovation acceptance model and develop three propositions. The model concerns 'perceived advantage' and 'perceived anxiety' of users (antecedents), 'learning intention' (mediator), and 'learning infusion' (consequence). The 'perceived advantage' is the positive outcome observed by individuals and it includes perceived cognitive advantage and perceived emotional advantage. The 'perceived anxiety' is the negative outcome observed by individuals and it includes information anxiety, patient education, patient misunderstanding, colleague competitiveness and coercive force of institution.

All the basics courses in the first and second semester have been taught as part of projects and involve teamwork. Modern engineering students are difficult to motivate in order to learn pure theoretical issues such as solving differential equations. Especially when we talk about undergraduate engineering students, who do not expect to continue their education higher than a Bachelor of Science in Engineering. At the same time, and for the same reason, the fail rate in mathematics is very high during the first two semesters. This was the reason we decided to change the structure of our education and incorporate the theory with practical projects. This paper describes some of the projects. The projects are the motivating factors to learn mathematics. The examination results show improved learning potential, when using this method of engineering education.

While this teaching and learning paradigm is relatively new in Malaysia, it has been practiced widely in the West. This paper examines a particular approach whereby students learning wireless security are divided into small manageable groups consisting of black hat and white hat team. The former will try to find and expose vulnerabilities in a wireless network while the latter will try to prevent such attacks on their wireless networks using hardware, software, design and enforcement of security policy and etc. This paper will try to demonstrate whether this approach will result in a more fruitful outcome in terms of students concept and theory understandings and motivation to learn.",,Electronic:978-1-4244-4844-9; POD:978-1-4244-4843-2,10.1109/ICEED.2009.5490612,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5490612,NS-2;education;networks;security;wireless;wireless networks simulation,Communication system security;Communications technology;Computer networks;Computer security;Data security;Engineering education;Hardware;Information security;Software design;Wireless networks,,,,0.0,,16.0,,,,7-8 Dec. 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,information technology education theory,5

Skills involving analysis, evaluation and synthesis are considered to be of higher order, requiring diverse learning and teaching methods than the customary learning of facts and concepts. HOTS involves the learning of complex judgmental skills such as critical thinking and problem solving. They are activated when individuals encounter unfamiliar problems, uncertainties, questions, or dilemmas. Successful application of the skills results in justifications, decisions, performances, and products that are valid within the context of existing knowledge that encourages continued growth in other intellectual skills. The major difficulty in attaining HOTS among engineering students is that we still pursue the traditional approach of teacher-centered classroom where the teacher is an active transmitter and the students are passive recipients. To achieve HOTS among engineering students we establish an Active Learning Environment (ALE) with the effective usage of Information and communication technologies (ICT). Active learning is embodied in a learning environment where the teachers and students are actively engaged with the content through discussions, problem-solving, critical thinking, or a multitude of activities that encourage interaction among learners, instructors and the material. Supporting to active learning, the ICT usage lends itself to more student-centered learning. This paper demonstrates the strategies to achieve HOTS through various ALE strategies like Role Play, Jigsaw, Brainstorming, debate, Mind map etc for Concept Understanding and Group assignments, combined mini projects, Discussion on Topics, Quiz, and Puzzles for Concept Applying. We have applied various learning strategies and assessed the student outcomes. HOTS is achieved by developing applications or products, with improved inter personal skills and lifelo- g learning skills.

Government has put a major focus on using E-services for easing processes in most, if not all of their Ministries. Governments have quickly realised the benefits to be reaped from early adoption of technology. With the advent of globalisation, better awareness and communication has paved the way for developing strategies to enable a citizen centric approach in the provision of ubiquitous on-line services to the population.

In the context of virtual education, a question that remains to be solved is associated with the level of motivation possessed by the students during the course. Usually, at the School of Engineering in the University of Medelli?n, this issue is tackled through activities such as chats and forums. Mostly, these activities are not enough to motivate the student in the activities related with the learning process. This work proposes two motivation strategies based on gamification and constructivism. These strategies are validated in a course called programming fundamentals, taught to all bachelor degrees given in the School of Engineering. Results obtained through the experiments suggest that proposed strategies improve the student's performance and satisfaction in the course.

Geographical barriers, socioeconomic position, race, education, and cost all contribute to health care disparities. These disparities may not only obstruct access to the most appropriate rehabilitative care, but may contribute to psychological problems, reduced quality of life, and unsuccessful return to meaningful community participation. Information and communications technology (ICT) when combined with robotic technology can enhance the accessibility of rehabilitation in low-resource, capacity-constrained settings.

However, the large amount of information available is not sufficient to ensure the development of future learners in technical disciplines, such as Computer Science and Engineering disciplines. High dropout rates and failure in this type of course are common in Brazilian Universities and few initiatives are taken to improve the situation. Nevertheless, the labor market demands of its workers technological training, especially in informatics. By coordinating a work group to develop the project ?Integrated Student? for two consecutive years at the Federal University of Espirito Santo (UFES), we proposed innovative teaching strategies used both for the development of the course participants and for the tutor's academic lives.

Changes and processes in the field of information technology and telecommunications are fast, wide spread and revolutionary, even aggressive. This analysis is based upon the experiments and data of Service Centre of Sze?chenyi University. The key findings of this paper is the conclusion that for the higher education institution is vital for applying infocommunication tools for reaching the cognitive entities, the young generations. The paper focuses on the development of communication channels, online communication and social media, furthermore tends to give an overall picture of the rapidly growing role of social media as a tool among Hungarian higher institutions. The financial position of institutions depends more and more on customer behaviour. Customer behaviour has an influence on the higher education market; it has an effect on the choice of institution and also on future target groups. So it is significant for these institutions to pay attention to consumer expectations and communicate effectively with their consumers, using the latest and the most advanced information communication technologies. It is particularly important because the universities' target groups are mostly the Y and Z generations into whose everyday activities modern info communication technologies are embedded. In the frame of our paper we give an overview of the trends and long term features - such as digitalization, info-communication, and social media - on marketing communication tools at Sze?chenyi University. The case study shows the multifaceted nature of the problem, the range of possible tools and their application. Due to the labour market needs Sze?c- enyi Istva?n University strengthens relations with the business sector and broadens the range of teaching and research services provided by them. In the case study we can follow the development of communication channels/instruments; the digital evolution and the phenomenon that the social web has become the most important (strategic) platform for communicating with the young generations; overall trends in interactive communication and online communities, and the emergence of interactive channels; social media, networks and online videos. The universities have to employ professionals with social media skills and they have to create communicating strategies for different generations. We have a real case about how younger ""always online"" communication professionals formulate the core requirements; and how we can integrate the communication centre with the newest info communication tools, such as mobile communication: applications. We can conclude that as the World Wide Web becomes more and more influential, social media has become the most important tool of marketing communication for universities to reach the public.",,Electronic:978-1-4673-8129-1; POD:978-1-4673-8130-7; USB:978-1-4673-8128-4,10.1109/CogInfoCom.2015.7390641,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7390641,Case Study Introduction;Higher Education;Marketing Communication;Non-business Organistations;Y and Z Generation,Communications technology;Education;Market research;Media;Organizations;Presses,computer aided instruction;consumer behaviour;educational institutions;further education;market research;social networking (online),Hungarian higher institutions;IT telecommunication technologies;Service Centre of Szechenyi University;coginfo application;communication channels;customer behaviour;higher education institution;information technology;marketing communication;marketing systems;nonbusiness organization;online communication;social Web;social media,,,,12.0,,,,19-21 Oct. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,information technology education strategies,5

Teaching programming needs careful selection of different supportive pedagogical methods to help students progress. When the teaching does not meet students' expectations, frustration occurs. Programming is usually introduced to Information Technology students in their first year of study. Different types of new students exist - some are prepared for university studies and others struggle. Students' engagement affects students' success or failure rates in programming. Only engaged students can allocate time on doing programming related activities. Engaged students who come to class with positive outlook are more likely to achieve better. Frustration can hinder the process of learning and it can occur when teaching methods don't appeal to students or when students don't receive timely feedback on their programming errors. From the literature, learning strategy, collaboration, self efficacy, time availability, interest, support, scaffolding, availability of devices and resources and comfort level were identified as the leading attributes that affect engagement in programming.

In this perspective, MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) have been promoting research in the technological and educational areas, since they serve as an emerging and powerful knowledge-building platform for anyone, anytime and anywhere. However, limitations in the current development of MOOCs have required the search for strategies to support their personalization in order to enhance the users' learning and others skills, such as the ability to self-regulate and to work in a collaborative way, and not just to replicate the content already taught in the traditional classroom, through videos or other passive learning activities. Considering the need for changes in the MOOC's pedagogical model, this research aimed to investigate and promote a reflection about the possibility of using Flipped Classroom Teaching Model principles to design this type of virtual and massive environment. The paper starts with a description of MOOCs, Flipped Classroom and some related works used to support personalized learning in MOOCs. As a result of this investigation, we present some conceptual strategies for educators to design MOOCs from FC ideas and principles. We envisage that adaptation and incorporation of concepts of Flipped Classroom, already applied in face-to-face classroom, can also act as an effective intervention to support personalized learning in MOOCs, helping students to take the active role in their own process acquisition of skills and knowledge construction.",,Paper:978-1-4799-8454-1,10.1109/FIE.2015.7344146,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344146,Flipped Classroom;Learning Design;Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs);Personalization,Collaboration;Collaborative work;Context;Education;Games;Online services;Videos,computer aided instruction;educational courses;information technology,ICT;face-to-face classroom;flipped classroom teaching model principles;flipped classroom theory;information and communication technologies;knowledge construction;knowledge-building platform;learning experiences;massive environment;massive open online courses;passive learning activities;personalized design;skills acquisition;virtual education;virtual environment,,1.0,,39.0,,,,21-24 Oct. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,information technology education strategies,7

Based on our experience teaching college students in these environments, we have noted that on entering school, generally, individuals demonstrate limited background knowledge of a variety of computer related technologies. Students begin with a technical disadvantage that represents a readily exploitable attack vector for identity thieves. Because of the experience deficit, the hazard of identity theft is significant with possible severe detrimental outcomes for the student victim. In addition, the negative impact on the society as a whole is substantial. Methods that reach beyond traditional formal computer or network security instruction in the classroom and extend information assurance education across disciplines are needed. We have explored this direction at the university and have worked on strategies to educate students about identity theft. The interdisciplinary programs outlined here span the curriculum.

MNT face 8 global challenges from the total 15. The education on MNT requires specific curricula and methods due to its multidisciplinary character on one hand and the declining numbers of students willing to study the ?hard? sciences on the other. The paper considers a joint MEng/MSc University degree course in MNT under the ""Romanian-Bulgarian Services Centre for Microsystems and Nanotechnology"" project. It is developed by two of the project partners: National Institute for Research and Development in Microtechnologies - IMT Bucharest and Ruse University ""Angel Kanchev"", and University Politehnica of Bucharest. In the paper analyses supporting the development of the course is presented. The basic clusters of information required for the development of the course are specified and structured. More particularly a portfolio of technologies and services of interest for the business were defined as well as design and managerial skills required for the engineers. Exemplary structure of the proposed MNT course is also discussed. Three major blocks of modules are suggested: core, specific, optional. They are followed by an Individual Project. It is also envisaged that the course would cover several key areas of MNTs such as: IC Materials and Systems; Bio Materials and Systems; Manufacturing Materials and Systems. An indicative content of the modules is also presented and discussed from the point of view of the aims of the course; learning outcomes; targeted intellectual, practical and t- ansferable skills; teaching and learning patterns; assessments methods. In general the course will provide an understanding of micro/nano manufacturing processes and systems. It will enable the engineers to appreciate the role of efficiency, process and materials selection in the design and production of MNT products.

The tool for achieving this goal is a repository-in-collaboration where resources could be shared, well-catalogued and well-managed. In light of the experience, we have identified the factors that influence sharing and reusing resources and which have been tested on university teaching staff of introductory math courses. Among these factors, we have observed a high degree of sharing practice but constraints on reusing, due to prioritization of time and a lack of information regarding open licenses. The first year results allow us to establish essential lines of action in order to consolidate and enhance this experience within the mathematical teaching community at the Catalan university system: a) simplify the prototype and its workflows; b) articulate the shared resources in a normalized and clear way; c) develop strategies for consolidating the community and dissemination of information; and d) enhance the institutional recognition of teaching practice.",0190-5848;01905848,Electronic:978-1-4799-3922-0; POD:978-1-4799-3923-7; USB:978-1-4799-3921-3,10.1109/FIE.2014.7044357,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044357,CIRAX;Catalan University System;Open Educational Resources;interuniversity collaboration;repositories;teaching quality,Collaboration;Communities;Educational institutions;Materials;Mathematics;Prototypes,educational courses;educational technology;information dissemination;mathematics computing;teaching,CIRAX pilot experience;Catalan university academic staff;Col?laboratori interuniversitari de recursos d'aprenentatge en xarxa;influence sharing;information dissemination;information technologies;institutional recognition;interuniversity collaboration;introductory math courses;knowledge-sharing communities of practice;learning practices;mathematical teaching community;open licenses;openness movement;teaching practice;university teaching staff,,0.0,,22.0,,,,22-25 Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,information technology education strategies,7

The students would take equal benefit by developing their understanding as a part of their academic studies whilst gaining valuable scientific level learning experience. Over the recent decades, different scholarly strategies have become common as a consequence of numerous developments in the engineering learning interdisciplinary such as Science and Engineering Ethics (SEE), Excellence in Engineering Education (ExcEEd), Project-Based Learning (PBL), Service Learning (SL), Socratic Method (SM), Life-Cycle Analysis (LCA), Information and Communication Technologies in Engineering Education (ICTEEd), Open Ended Group Project Framework (OEGP) engineering pedagogies. It has already been scrutinized that each pedagogy approach has specifically its own effects and limitations, and no one approach is suitable for every engineering interdisciplinary so it is very essential to make a comparative analysis on different engineering pedagogy strategies and design an approach on global basis that will constitute all the features. This paper presents a comparative assessment of aforementioned pedagogy strategies in engineering interdisciplinary along with their characteristics, features and future scope. More specifically, this paper reports the careful use of each strategy to provide the most invigorating and supportive environment for students to continue exploring their potential.

New methods demand new organisation alternatives that, in turn, require new educational policies and put pressure in current assumptions of education itself. Distance Education is a challenge by itself. It places new demands both to the learner, but also to the facilitator. A set of seven dimensions for a distance learning environment were identified, which positively impacts the setting of learning experiences: (1) access tools; (2) technology experience; (3) habits and study skills; (4) human factors and life style; (5) goals and guidelines; (6) learning preferences; (7) personal characteristics [1]. This paper defends that the learners, when asked about their characteristics, taking into account different issues of their familiar, personal and professional life, available technology resources, technology skills, as well as motivation and learning preferences, provide an information set that, if turn available to facilitators, allow to both players (learners and facilitators) the mechanisms that ease the adoption of learning strategies, that enhance the possibility of a well succeed learning experience. To accomplish the research goals, an empiric study was conducted in the context of a Distance Education (DE) institution, taking a sample of 214 learners, with diverse characteristics. The data analysis allows the confirmation of the position validity and proves that it is possible to know in advance the distance learners more important characteristics and of the surrounding environment as means to access potential success and rate failure.

Augmented Reality (AR) is a new technology with vast potentials and great pedagogical value that offers new methods for education. AR enables the overlaying of computer-generated virtual information into the real environment in real time. Thus, researchers believed that the AR has provided new opportunities for designing engaging learning environments. Although the AR may improve educational outcomes, the main factor is to understand the process of designing the AR to support learning activities. Thus, various instructional strategies such as collaborative learning, were considered when designing an AR learning environment.

National policy documents give ICT a high priority in development of the country's educational system. Curricula have been revamped to accommodate for increased role of ICT in the society and education. Also educational institutions have explicated high expectations of ICT in the process of ""massification of education."" Several research studies, however, have showed little change in the classrooms. Surveys and case studies have showed that on the way from policy documents to strategy level and implementation level, something gets missing. The lack of ICT in education is clear in primary and secondary school, which is unsurprising, given that majority of schools also lack electricity and basic facilities, including proper classrooms, tables, and books. This study sets out to investigate, using thematic interviews of secondary school teachers in Tanzania, what processes and support structures do teachers consider to be lacking in terms of ICT supported education. Informants from teacher training colleges were also involved in order to bring out viewpoints from teacher training. The results confirmed a large number of earlier results, divided to six categories: school policy, implementation and administration on the school level, access to ICT, leadership and management, school culture, and teacher training. A number of new factors were also pinpointed: teachers' lack of awareness of government policies and documentation on several levels, lack of pedagogical readiness for e-learning and blended learning, and cultural concerns. Concerning what should come first, there was a chicken-and-egg-problem: it makes little sense to invest in rapidly aging ICT infrastructure and facilities if there is no human capacity to make use of those investments, and it makes little sense to invest in human capacity if there is no technol- gical infrastructure to put quickly aging technical know-how into immediate use.",,Electronic:978-1-4799-3592-5; POD:978-1-4799-3593-2; USB:978-1-4799-3591-8,10.1109/LaTiCE.2014.31,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821841,Classroom Activities;Culture;Educational Technology;ICT management;Information and Communication Technology (ICT);Tanzania;Teacher education;Teachers' expectations;Teachers' experiences,Computers;Educational institutions;Government;Internet;Interviews;Training,computer aided instruction;educational courses;educational institutions;government policies;information technology;teacher training,ICT supported education;Tanzanian secondary schools;blended learning;classroom teachers;cultural concerns;e-learning;educational curricula;educational institutions;educational system development;government policies;information and communication technology;national policy documents;pedagogical readiness;teacher training colleges,,1.0,,56.0,,,,11-13 April 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,information technology education strategies,7

As we can see today, most of the teaching and learning activities at all level of studies have been integrated with various forms of technologies, particularly with the Information and Communication Technology. This technology often relates to online learning, which usually involves the use of various forms of 2-dimensional applications. However, the recent times have seen many educational institutions around the globe shifting their interest towards the use of a new application for online learning, known as the virtual world. The virtual world has unique capabilities and unlike its 2-dimensional counterpart, it can generate a 3-dimensional social learning space, amplify the sense of presence and immersion of students, and support various forms of communications and interactions. Utilizing these capabilities with proper instructional strategies in conducting online learning activities can greatly enhance the online learning experience. Without a doubt, the virtual world has been considered as an important tool in modern education practice, especially for collaborative learning. To obtain a comprehensible view of this trend, this paper reviews some of the latest studies which have involved collaborative learning in virtual world.

More concretely, we present the work that is being developed for the creation of a set of learning activities for the creative arts and cultural education curricula using ICT and Web 2.0 tools. The study was based on the principles of the development methodology approach (Van den Akker, 1999). Following this perspective, and using a focus group strategy, we present here the strategies created to catch the view of a group of art teachers previously selected on the basis of knowledge and experience of using technology in their teaching practice. Assuming the importance of involving teachers in the process of design and development of learning activities, we selected and worked during three months with a group of twelve experienced teachers in the use of the potential of information and communication tools, in particular in the use of Web 2.0 features. The main questions to answer with this joint reflection were: a) In the area of creative arts what kind of learning activities can benefit from the potential of digital technologies available today?; b) How should those activities be organized and presented to less motivated teachers in order to motivate them to use digital technologies in their practices? The preliminary results suggests the idea of structuring activities not individually, but in a ""creative project integrator"" as a way to bring inexperienced teachers from the arts and culture areas to meet the pedagogical potential of digital technologies and to integrate them more effectively in his or her teaching practice. In fact, the expert teachers interviewed suggest a consensus that the proposed activities should be organized around a common educational goal, albeit with - ufficient flexibility that allows inexperienced teachers build or adjust their own content and context.

Univ., Singapore, Singapore",2013 IEEE 63rd Annual Conference International Council for Education Media (ICEM),20140526.0,2013,,,1,11,"In today's knowledge-based economy, education is not only an essential instrument for knowledge acquisition and self-development, but also a mandatory tool that enables students to secure a good job, gain respect in society, and develop a personal identity. The importance of having the intellectual curiosity, ability to effectively apply the acquired knowledge/skills and job expertise becomes even more crucial in the highly competitive, fast-paced workplace. As a result, students are increasingly pressured to excel and succeed in this compelling academic journey. Globalization and rapid advancements in technology have facilitated many new e-teaching tools and social media platforms to cope with changing trends in students' receptivity to information and communication styles, making it even more essential for educators to continually review the education system in order to convey knowledge to students more creatively and effectively. Consequently, the instructional approaches which influence the behavioral aspect of learning that motivate and stimulate an individual's interest in learning and effective understanding with acquiring of knowledge are essential to examine. With deeper reflection and analysis on the behavioral learning of students, instructors could better comprehend the needs and expectations which facilitate providing their students the necessary inputs. Through this instructional article, a learning framework ?Perspective Transformation of instructors in Pedagogical Strategies? is proposed to facilitate more effective learning among business students. The conceptual framework proposes a shift from instructor-centric to learner-centric in the instructional roles, design of curriculum and assessments, learning culture and feedback process, by adopting five essential strategies: (1) Performing different instructional roles for varying types of instructional approaches (2) Shift in learning culture: embracing creative learning; (3) Prof- ssional soft skills training; (4) Assessments based on three fundamentals of understanding, critical thinking and application; (5) Continuous process of correspondence between instructors and students coupled with reflection in terms of formative and summative feedback; These learning approaches within the proposed framework have been applied in the classroom context at Nanyang Technological University, Nanyang Business School, in Semester 2 Annual Year 12/13. They have resulted in good course assessment and examination outcomes with positive feedback from students.

Panchoo,"SAFE, Univ. of Technol., Port Louis, Mauritius",2013 Africon,20140306.0,2013,,,1,7,"As human manpower is an important asset for Mauritius, strategies are deployed and incentives are given to encourage lifelong learning. Thus, tertiary institutions in Mauritius are increasingly developing courses with the aim of reaching a larger student population through a flexible mode of learning. However, it is well known that distant learners' motivation fades away and that the rates of dropouts have not considerably decreased across the years. To give adequate supports to the distant learners, tertiary institutions are keeping up with the emerging technologies, from radio, television, audio/video conferencing to the World Wide Web. The aim of this paper is to assess the institutions' contributions to distance learning with regards to both technological and pedagogical supports. The methodology opted is of qualitative nature and it includes investigation through desktop research, informal interviews and testimonials of students. Six distance education institutions in Mauritius were chosen for this research. Interestingly, results show the institutions use emerging information and communication technologies (ICTs) for their teaching and learning process.

A conceptual model was developed to investigate the various factors impacting on business/IT alignment. This model suggests that an assessment of: the strategy formulation processes employed at the institution; the organizational culture at the institution; and the institution's alignment maturity using strategic alignment maturity criteria will enable the determination of factors inhibiting/enabling alignment. The findings revealed that achieving business/IT alignment is still a pervasive problem within the tertiary education sector, with a number of obstacles inhibiting alignment. Strategy formulation was found to be largely top-down with IT strategies having little input towards shaping organizational strategies.

Upon entering adolescence, patients are expected to adopt a greater role in self-management. However, adolescents often have difficulty adhering to management regimens, which can lead to poor health outcomes. There is a need for a technology that addresses the compound social and technical needs of these patients and their informal caregivers while filling the gaps of current information technology management tools. Through an IRB-approved process, group and individual interviews were conducted with ten adolescents with T1D ranging in age from 11-17 and informal caregivers. The purpose of these interviews was to learn about (1) adolescents' day-to-day management of T1D, (2) the role of the informal caregiver and (3) the role of technology in this management. Qualitative content analysis presented four key themes: the person (the adolescent and informal caregiver), the interactions between the adolescent and informal caregiver, interactions with technology, and physical environments where these interactions occur. These themes led to the development of user-centered design considerations. Final design recommendations included the importance of customization, integration with current T1D technologies, accessibility while maintaining security, and diabetes education.

Its employment in scientific and engineering studies often leads to an oversimplification of the underlying flow physics. In reality, complex flows are ubiquitous, and commonly arise from fluid-body interactions with man-made structures, such as bridges as well as from natural flows along rocky river beds. Studying flows outside of laboratory conditions requires more detailed information in addition to time-averaged flow properties. The choice of in situ measuring device capable of delivering turbulence metrics is determined based on site accessibility, the required measuring period, and overall flow complexity. Current devices are suitable for measuring turbulence under controlled laboratory conditions, and thus there remains a technology gap for turbulence measurement in the field. In this paper, we show how a bioinspired fish-shaped probe outfitted with an artificial lateral line can be utilized to measure turbulence metrics under challenging conditions. The device and proposed signal processing methods are experimentally validated in a scale vertical slot fishway, which represents an extreme turbulent environment, such as those commonly encountered in the field.

The idea of open access to scientific information resources promotes use of mostly free of charge scientific information resources thus substituting use of fee based access to scientific information resources. Open access has both advantages and disadvantages. Main advantages would be greater visibility of published research, greater accessibility of scientific content in general, higher rates of citations etc. and disadvantages would be questionable quality of peer review, absence of peer review in some cases, charging authors for publishing their articles, lack of long term preservation policy etc. This paper also presents results of a study of use of digital information resources by students enrolled in two university courses at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Zagreb over period of three years. The results showed that students prefer digital over printed information resources in researched two courses and that they are oriented more towards use of different types of free information resources for writing their term papers instead use of fee based information resources.",,CD-ROM:978-953-233-081-6; Electronic:978-953-233-077-9; POD:978-1-4799-5657-9,10.1109/MIPRO.2014.6859644,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6859644,,Educational institutions;Internet;Libraries;Open Access;Web pages,Internet;educational courses;electronic publishing;further education;information resources;teaching,Croatia;Internet;digital information resources;free information resources;higher education institutions;open access information resources;open access initiative;peer review;scientific information resources;teaching,,0.0,,28.0,,,,26-30 May 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,information technology accessibility education,5
52,99,Comprehension of basic mathematics among children with hearing impairment using multimedia in accessible and non-accessible format a comparative study,P. K. Gupta; P. J. M. Martin,,2013 IEEE 63rd Annual Conference International Council for Education Media (ICEM),20140526.0,2013,,,1,11,"Teaching mathematics has been a complex issue for educators as well as learners. Same is the condition for the hearing impaired learners. Multimedia can be a big facilitator in order to render simpler and effective learning methods in the field of teaching mathematics to the hearing impaired students. The guidelines of United Nations Convention of Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD, 2007), makes provision for creation of information in accessible format. However there are no research studies to establish that teaching mathematics through the accessible format of multimedia would increase comprehension levels in children with hearing impairment. According to Mary Ellen Foster (2003) in her study on visual comprehension found that `Intuitively, one way of determining the usefulness of any presentation of data is by measuring the ease with which tasks involving that data can be performed using that presentation'. It may be noted that children with hearing impairment use visual techniques in their thought process, therefore accessible format of multimedia will enhance their comprehension levels. Accessible format includes techniques such as captioning, sign language and audio description. This can be very helpful in processing information by hearing impaired children. The study investigated the effects of multimedia in accessible format, through the use of captioning and Indian sign language (ISL), on hearing impaired children. Hearing impaired viewers watched twice, the short multimedia with and without accessibility formats respectively. Their reactions were recorded on a questionnaire developed for the purpose of the study. Forty nine students participated in this study from two deaf schools of Mumbai, India. Analysis of the data showed that there was difference in the effects of accessible and non accessible formats of on the Hearing Impaired viewers. The study also showed that accessible formats increase the comprehension of the subject of the multimedia- and use of ISL and captioning helped hearing impaired students to understand concepts better. The hearing impaired persons correlated watching the ISL interpreter with understanding the concept of the topic of multimedia. Placement of the ISL interpreter in the screen was also covered under the study.",,Electronic:978-1-4799-3216-0; POD:978-1-4799-2753-1,10.1109/CICEM.2013.6820182,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820182,Accessible format;Captioning;Comprehension;Education Multimedia;Hearing Impairment;Indian Sign Language,Assistive technology;Auditory system;Conferences;Education;Gesture recognition;Mathematics;Multimedia communication,computer aided instruction;educational institutions;handicapped aids;multimedia communication;natural language processing;sign language recognition,ISL;Indian sign language;Mumbai deaf schools;audio description;captioning;comprehension level enhancement;hearing impaired children;hearing impaired learners;mathematics subject;multimedia accessible format;visual techniques,,0.0,,5.0,,,,1-4 Oct. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,information technology accessibility education,10

According to different sources, the number of users over age 65 has more than doubled since 2000. Besides, the inevitable effect of younger users aging will increase the number of older people using the Internet the next decades. Unfortunately, older people face several challenges when using the web due to diminishing capacities related to aging, such as vision decline, hearing loss, decremented motor skills and cognition issues. On the other hand, e-learning can be an opportunity in helping older people become integrated with the rest of society. In this context, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) bring great opportunities to enhance the quality of life of older people by enabling lifelong learning and inclusion in learning communities. However, MOOCs can present some barriers that could hamper full participation by elderly students. In order to avoid these barriers, MOOCs have to meet different user needs, skills and situations: MOOCs have to successfully address web accessibility challenges for elderly students.

Student role changed to be knowledge and information hunter rather than receiver, and teaching, meanwhile, is becoming a peripheral activity. Several interactive and new methods of learning has evolved in the last two decades aimed to utilizing the information and communication technology tools to improve the educational process availability and accessibility. The learning management system (LMS) is the system responsible for integrating all learning services and managing teaching and learning activities. It provides a collection of tools and functions to support teaching and learning processes, usually including course management tools, online group discussion, homework collections and grading, and course evaluation. This study was conducted to evaluate different open source learning management systems that were under consideration to be implemented by the College of Medicine, King Saud University (CMKSU), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The study reviewed open source and commercial LMS systems as a future strategy. Objectives: the main objective of the current study was to assess the open source LMS systems based on conducting literature review and practical evaluation. The study included a literature review on LMS including commercial and open source systems. The study focused on evaluating three open source LMS systems, Jusur, Sakai, and Moodle. Jusur is the LMS adopted by the National E-learning center in Saudi Arabia, and the other two LMS systems are considered as the principal open source LMS systems implemented worldwide. Methodology: this study depended on published technical reports, LMS systems official websites, and industry reviews, as well as examining the products features and evaluating how they meet CMKSU needs and requirements. Results: All the three LMS systems provide excellent tools including discussion boards, chat sessions- - , and other collaboration tools. Jusur has a strong localization features and technical support and training. On the other hand Sakai and Moodel were ranked better for the user interface and other content and course management features. Sakai is having the advantage of being developed in Java platform. Moodle and Sakai support integration with other systems, while Jusur support the integration in the offline mode only. Conclusion: Open source LMS systems is more recommended because of its popularity among reputable universities, and the benefits of such systems including exchange of experience and e-courses if the development efforts are guaranteed, as well as the availability of the skills required for the development. In the current study, the evaluation focused on the features of LMS systems and a combination of several frameworks to enhance the evaluation process. All three LMS systems provide excellent tools for student interactions and activities. Standards and integration that make these systems able to communicate with other students and hospitals systems are critical features. In addition, the LMS system should be able as well to mange and accommodate a huge amount of information that needed among medical and educational content, including different subjects, lecture notes, lecture videos, text books, videos of surgeries, and radiology images.",,Electronic:978-1-4244-8618-2; POD:978-1-4244-8616-8,10.1109/ICEMT.2010.5657569,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5657569,,Biomedical imaging;Educational institutions;Electronic learning;Information systems;Information technology;Least squares approximation,Java;Web sites;biomedical education;courseware;educational courses;educational institutions;information technology;interactive systems;medical computing;public domain software;teaching,Java platform;Moodle;Sakai;Saudi Arabia;Web site;course management tool;educational process;homework collection;information and communication technology;interactive learning method;learning service;online group discussion;open source learning management system;teaching;university medical education,,6.0,,32.0,,,,2-4 Nov. 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,information technology accessibility education,5

In the capital of the Brazilian state of Amazonas, Manaus, the situation is critical. The lack of professionals is considered a major risk, and to prepare students is a real challenge as there are few undergraduate courses, and the typical dropout rate is very high. STEM education is intricately difficult and if the student is not well involved, supported and motivated, the chances of success are very low. To address this scenario, a qualification program denominated ""multiple vortexes of know-how"" was conceived to address three aspects: i) reduce student dropout; ii) enlarge the reachable community; iii) offer different levels of knowledge. Vortex is in essence an action, working interconnected and coordinated to other vortexes. Four different actions were prepared: classroom disciplines; a talent development program; holding short-term events, and enrolling in intensive training.

After detailing CSCW models that discuss the dimensions that characterise interaction and technology use in groups, we examine aspects of group learning from the perspective of theories of CSCL. Issues of cooperation versus collaboration, motivation for learning and models of group cognition are discussed in the context of two specific group projects. Analysis of these examples allows us to characterise behaviour within groups and provide insights that can facilitate the formation and effective development of project teams.

This evolution was exemplified through three stages: traditional didactics, modern didactics and postmodern didactics. The problem of knowledge belongs to philosophy, respectively gnoseology or epistemology. From scientific knowledge to the knowledge of school type, is reached through a process called Didactics Transposition by Chevallard in 1982. The concept evolved into Anthropological Didactics Transposition by Chevallard in 2012. and Theory of Didactic Situations by Guy Brousseau in 1986.

After a short description of these theories the paper presents the personal contributions on graphic representation of curriculum intentionally and curriculum tested. For exemplifying the new method are presented two applications suggestive. Definition paradigm, as designating a model, was used in the book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, published in 1962. The author Thomas Kuhn completes the definition of paradigm, following the impact produced on the scientific community, in Postscript, published in 1970. Three personal contribution using specific methods and learning mechanisms from engineering education are presented for a better understanding of this aspect. The paradigms of the curriculum use to guide Postmodern Didactics.

15,31,Application of the Pedagogical and Andragogical Model in Web-Based Learning Instruction Among Non-major Computer Science Students' Learning Programming,N. M. Noor; J. Harun; B. Aris,"Fac. of Educ., Univ. Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Malaysia",2014 International Conference on Teaching and Learning in Computing and Engineering,20140602.0,2014,,,106,111,"This study identified the pedagogical and and ragogical learning orientations preferred by non-major Computer Science students in one of the higher education institutions in Malaysia. The pedagogical and and ragogical learning orientation model differs in six assumptions about learners, which are: the learner's need to know, self concept, existing experience, readiness to learn, orientation to learning, and motivation [1]. Questionnaires were developed and distributed among 262 undergraduate students in non-major Computer Science Faculty who took the Introduction to Programming Language course. Descriptive analyses have also been conducted (alpha - 0.958), and the results showed that a majority of the sample in this study (246 respondents or 93.9%) stay under Stage 2 in the four stages of learning development. This means that the respondents had a high preference for pedagogical as well as and ragogical learning orientations. Data collected shows that non-major Computer Science students in the age range of 18 to 24 are able to work independently since their self-concept had progressed to the self-directed learning phase. However, they still need guidance from their lecturers. These findings were used to develop a prototype of an individualized online learning environment based on the pedagogy and and ragogy as its foundational model. Learners in Stage 2 need goal-setting, learning strategies, and evaluation to be set by the teacher. The online learning environment allowed the student to explore her learning modules from easy to hard levels. However, students were allowed to continue to the next module even though their performance was not yet at the passing level. This is based on and ragogical theory, that they are dependent learners with a moderate level of self-directedness. Additional learning materials were also provided that could be freely explored by learners at their own pace. The prototype was tested among one group of 32 students in the Faculty of Educa- ion in the course Introduction to Programming using Pre-Experimental Research Design. The statistical analysis conducted indicated that the application of the pedagogical and and ragogical Model in web based instruction had a positive effect on learners' outcomes.",,Electronic:978-1-4799-3592-5; POD:978-1-4799-3593-2; USB:978-1-4799-3591-8,10.1109/LaTiCE.2014.27,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821837,andragogy;learning programming for non-majors;pedagogy,Computer languages;Education;Instruments;Programming profession;Prototypes,computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;further education;programming,Faculty of Education;Web based instruction;Web-based learning instruction;andragogical model;higher education institutions;individualized online learning environment;introduction to programming language course;learning development;learning programming;learning strategy;nonmajor computer science faculty;nonmajor computer science students;pedagogical learning orientation model;pedagogical model;ragogical learning orientation model;self-directed learning phase;undergraduate students,,0.0,,31.0,,,,11-13 April 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,computer science education theory,5

Schlattmann,"Hamburg University of Technology, Anlagensystemtechnik und methodische Produktentwicklung AmP, Germany",2013 International Conference on Interactive Collaborative Learning (ICL),20131024.0,2013,,,728,733,"The technical impact on future engineering education has two main reasons. One factor is the growth rate of technical knowledge in depth and width and the second reason is the wide range of options of knowledge transfer using computer techniques. Besides, there are also many other reasons, e.g. the efficiency of knowledge transfer, greater consideration of individual learning and teaching styles, economic and strategic reasons, focusing on new technologies and so on. The development of the techniques and their technologies are effected as generally known, with increasingly higher speed, so that the Half-life of technical knowledge is likely to shorten sustainable in the future. This is particularly the case in the highly innovative engineering subjects. Basically it should be differentiated between the terms ?technique? and ?technology?. Technique is the mode of operation and/or method which is for example used for the creation and engineering of products. Technology is actually the academics see or science of the technique. That means the term technology denotes the knowledge of a technique. But as known a clean mapping of terms from different viewpoints is strongly dependent. So already the respective language area plays an equally important role as the associated systemic view. Thus, certain terms can not transfer in each case clearly without exact knowledge of two scientific fields (languages). The same applies when knowledge from the biological realm is to be transferred into technical solutions, see bionics. The use of systems theory can here improve the transfer and/or exchange of knowledge from System 1 to System 2, see [1; 2].

Identity has been identified as a critical issue in the endeavour to increase students' engagement in Computer Science and related areas. Findings from earlier studies indicate that students' doubts about future engagement are often due to an unfortunate perception of the discipline, that it lacks meaning, which leads to a tendency to dissociate themselves from IT and Computer Science as an area of further study. To understand different ways of experiencing engagement in the discipline as personally meaningful, we have integrated aspects of Lave and Wenger's social theory of learning, especially Wenger's notion of meaning, with a model developed by Entwistle that describes how conceptions of learning and knowledge expand and evolve in the context of the educational experience. We explore the use of this theoretical framework on reflections that we collected from all novice students of the Computer Science and IT engineering programme at Uppsala University, in which the students reflect on their choice of study program, goals, and expectations for education. The theoretical framework is furthermore discussed with respect to our broader research project to study students' identity development in Computer Science and IT as well as the role of education, how it supports or hinders students and how this can be used to inform educational development.",,Electronic:978-0-7695-4960-6; POD:978-1-4673-5627-5,10.1109/LaTiCE.2013.42,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6542247,Computer Science;IT;engagement;identity;meaning and perception of the discipline,Communities;Computers;Context;Educational institutions;Programming,computer science education;educational institutions,IT engineering programme;Lave-Wenger learning social theory;Uppsala University;Wenger meaning notion;computer science;educational development;student engagement;student identity development,,1.0,,16.0,,,,21-24 March 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,computer science education theory,7

Such behaviour in students could be classified as a reaction to alien and counter-intuitive knowledge, as described in the works of Meyer and Land on threshold concepts. Since the threshold concept is, itself, a product of educational research, we would expect to have difficulty in explaining this concept to our colleagues. This is one possible explanation for the relatively slow penetration of computer science specific educational theory into modern computer science teaching practice. In this paper we examine the application of the threshold concept theory to the whole of our field of education, using the literature to find examples of how troublesome knowledge does, or does not, spread throughout the academic community. We track the adoption and display of knowledge of key concepts in Computer Science educational research, in order to identify common patterns in adoption and, by providing models to explain the flow of information across our discipline, provide an early indication of the role that threshold concepts (as a barrier to understanding) are playing in the community.",,Electronic:978-0-7695-4960-6; POD:978-1-4673-5627-5,10.1109/LaTiCE.2013.32,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6542237,computer science education;educational research;threshold concepts,Cognitive science;Communities;Computer science education;Programming profession,computer science education;teaching,academic community;computer science educational research;computer science specific educational theory;computer science teaching practice;counter-intuitive knowledge;interdisciplinary suspicion;personal experience;threshold concept theory,,0.0,,32.0,,,,21-24 March 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,computer science education theory,7

How did your education and early career lead to your initial and continuing interest in the control field? Xiaobo: It was fortuitous how I got into the control field. When I graduated from high school, I knew I would be going into some engineering field. However, I had no clue exactly what field would suit me. My second-oldest brother, who was then a sophomore majoring in civil engineering at Tsinghua University, told me computer science and automation were two of the ""hottest"" majors at Tsinghua. I gathered that automation would involve computers anyway, so it seemed smart to choose the former, which I did. I was pleased with my decision, since I saw the rigor and versatile applications of control theory. While completing my master's thesis on thyristor-controlled series compensation of power systems, I realized my passion in control system research. I then joined the University of Maryland to pursue my Ph.D., under the supervision of Prof. John Baras and Prof. P.S. Krishnaprasad. I was heavily influenced by their appreciation of mathematics and physics. My dissertation topic was on the modeling and control of hysteresis in smart material actuators.

Because of limited success in predicting the grade point average (GPA), most of the prior research has focused on predicting grades in a specific set of classes based on students? prior performances. The issues associated with data-driven models of GPA prediction are further amplified by a small sample size and a relatively large dimensionality of observations in an experiment. In this paper, we utilize the state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to construct and validate a predictive model of GPA solely based on a set of self-regulatory learning behaviors determined in a relatively small-sample experiment. We quantify the predictability of each constituents of the constructed model and discuss its relevance. Ultimately, the goal of grade prediction in similar experiments is to use the constructed models for the design of intervention strategies aimed at helping students at risk of academic failure. In this regard, we lay the mathematical groundwork for defining and detecting <italic>probably helpful interventions</italic> using a probabilistic predictive model of GPA.

However, the detection performance of an SCDMA system is mainly determined by its signature matrix, which should be sparse to facilitate the belief propagation (BP) detection. On the other hand, to guarantee good maximum likelihood (ML) detection performance, the minimum Euclidean distance for the equivalent signal constellation after multi-user superposition should be maximized. In this paper, a code distance analysis is proposed for SCDMA systems with a finite number of users and spreading lengths. Based on this analysis, good signature matrices whose factor graphs have very few short cycles and possess large superposed signal constellation distances are designed. The proposed signature matrices have both good BP and ML detection performances. Moreover, their BP detection performances exactly converge to their ML detection performances with few iterations.

The existing CAD system tries to realize a diagnosis process in an automatic way to replace the doctor?s diagnosis work completely, but it is difficult to capture the doctor?s detection and diagnosis needs and goals accurately due to lack of doctor?s experience. Thus, the accuracy is not up to the doctor?s manual diagnosis results, and it is a tedious and cumbersome job to use the system because it requires manual intervention, which leads to the fact that CAD system was difficult to be widely used. This paper analyzes the characteristics of doctors? diagnosis tasks deeply, and makes the reasonable allocation of tasks between the doctor and computer. Then the perceptual control theory is introduced into the task model, a PTT task model is proposed to make it express uncertainty of the doctor?s diagnosis tasks, and it can be used as a reference for future uncertainty task analysis.

The distributed transmission lines model for tapered through glass vias (T-TGVs) in signal-ground-signal type differential structure is first established and validated against the 3-D full-wave electromagnetic simulator. The model is applicable to TGVs made of carbon nanotubes(CNTs) by incorporating CNT quantum and kinetic effects. Using the proposed model, the impact of various parameters on the electrical characteristics of the differential T-TGVs is investigated. It is observed that the inductive element of conductor loss plays a significant role on the electrical performance, which makes the CNT-TGV interconnects show unique electrical characterization that totally different from its through silicon vias (TSVs) counterpart. For example, the signal loss of TGV interconnects in different-mode signaling is even lower than that in common-mode and increasing via pitch increases signal loss. Furthermore, the thermal performance of 2.5-D integration with TGVs is investigated with COMSOL multiphysics. It is shown that TGV is a primary path for heat dissipation and increasing TGV distribution density can significantly lower the peak temperature of 2.5-D integration.

While there are many tools that automate the detection of plagiarism in source code, users still need to inspect the results and decide whether there is plagiarism or not. Moreover, users often rely on a single tool (using it as ?gold standard? for all cases), which can be ineffective and risky. Hence, it is desirable to make use of several tools to complement their results. However, various limitations exist in these tools that make their usage a very time-consuming task, such as the need of manually analyzing and correlating their multiple outputs. In this paper, we propose an automated system that addresses the common usage limitations of plagiarism detection tools. The system automatically manages the execution of different plagiarism tools and generates a consolidated comparative visualization of their results. Consequently, the user can make better-informed decisions about potential plagiarisms.

We present a method to improve microwave breast imaging resolution that incorporates a priori information about the boundaries between different tissues in the breast into the inverse scattering algorithm. This spatial prior information can be derived from another imaging modality, such as magnetic resonance imaging. Our method exploits the fact that the dielectric properties within a tissue type exhibit low to moderate variability by favoring solutions to the inverse scattering problem, which have small variations in dielectric properties within each tissue region. The amount of variation tolerated in each regions is controlled by a spatial prior constraint parameter. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method by imaging detailed, anatomically inspired numerical 3-D breast phantoms. The performance in the presence of different levels of noise and for different choices of the constraint parameter is evaluated.

Gastpar,"Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology, Ansan, South Korea",IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,20171018.0,2017,63,11.0,7018,7037,"In this paper, we consider a cache aided network in which each user is assumed to have individual caches, while upon users' requests, an update message is sent through a common link to all users. First, we formulate a general information theoretic setting that represents the database as a discrete memoryless source, and the users' requests as side information that is available everywhere except at the cache encoder. The decoders' objective is to recover a function of the source and the side information. By viewing cache aided networks in terms of a general distributed source coding problem and through information theoretic arguments, we present inner and outer bounds on the fundamental tradeoff of cache memory size and update rate. Then, we specialize our general inner and outer bounds to a specific model of content delivery networks: file selection networks, in which the database is a collection of independent equal-size files and each user requests one of the files independently. For file selection networks, we provide an outer bound and two inner bounds (for centralized and decentralized caching strategies).

The course is 7,5 ECTS and the students are primarily adults in a worklife. The course is net and seminar based, with three seminars per semester. During the seminars the concept of Flipped Classroom is used. This means that the students are provided with a recorded lecture in beforehand and only highlights are presented. The rest of the time during the seminar is used to activate the students through tasks and problem solving. However, the tasks are not predefined and prefabricated. The way this course is structured, the students themselves are giving the input to the tasks and assignments. This is based on the idea that the students themselves, coming from a worklife where knowledge management is a part of their every day worklife, should reflect upon their own practice. Also, it is important to share knowledge and by utilizing each students own experiences it is possible to enrich the ?database? of cases or tasks for the students to solve and work with in order to incorporate the new theory from the course curriculum. Basing the problem solving on student input provide the lecturer AND the students with a richer knowledge base and case portfolio. This does, however, require some effort from the lecturers side. The input from the students are generally key words and fragments. The session is facilitated by the lecturer, encouraging the students to bring forward own experiences or situations they would like resolved, either real or fiction. The key words and fragments are discussed amongst the students and the lecturer makes notes on a blackboard or on a digital canvas (MS PowerPoint or similar). The students are given a break and the lecturer collects the key words and synthesizes this into- a case. Upon the return of the students, they solve the cases in groups and discuss possible solutions and what theory that apply to the different aspects of the case. Then a plenary session is facilitated where a suggested solution is developed. During a one-day seminar three to four cases are developed as a ?joint venture? amongst the students and the lecturer. The feedback from the students is very positive. They claim that this way of working strongly contributes to an enhanced learning outcome. Some students also report on utilizing knowledge acquired at these seminars back at their workplace. These are some results from the survey and interviews.

Taking the sensing and fusion accuracy into account, reputation distribution is introduced in the proposed game, where we prove theoretically the Nash equilibrium of the game and its uniqueness. Furthermore, we apply the proposed scheme to the cooperative spectrum sensing. We show that within an appropriate cost-to-gain ration, the optimal strategy for the secondary users is to report when the average received energy is above a given threshold and keep silence otherwise. Such an optimal strategy is also proved to be a desirable evolutionarily stable strategy.

Without installing any connection-oriented junction network, i.e., T-junction or star junction, only coupling slots are adopted herein to achieve required coupling coefficients and external quality factors toward the specified Chebyshev responses in the three passbands simultaneously. High isolation among these three separated bands can be effectively achieved owing to the modal orthogonality via sharing a common TMR structure as a feeder. Two triplexers are then designed and fabricated using varied topologies. The hybrid resonator triplexer method is presented as the first approach by using a TMR as a feeder to feed three sets of single-mode cavity bandpass filters. As the second approach, the triple-mode triplexer (TMT) method is developed by cascading a few TMRs to form a multistage higher order TMT.

In order to reduce the communication traffic, an f-PE-based slave-node is constructed to exploit the data and instruction localities of applications, and a master node that is used to schedule and serve data for the slave nodes is also integrated. Furthermore, to improve the ease of use of the architecture, a multiple instruction multiple data like programming model is adopted and an optimizing mapping strategy is developed.

To compensate the delay in the control of prosthesis, the signals in the stance phase are used to predict the terrain and speed in the swing phase. Specifically, the intent pattern recognizer utilizes intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) according to the Cartesian product of walking speed and terrain. Moreover, the sensor data are fused via DempsterShafer's theory. And hidden Markov model (HMM) is used to recognize the realtime motion state with the reference of the prior step. The proposed method can infer the prosthesis user's intent of walking on different terrain, which includes level ground, stair ascent, stair descent, up and down ramp.

On the one hand, network densification provides opportunities to cooperate among a large number of access points (APs) for serving a given user. On the other hand, the limited radio resources cause the serious competition among numerous APs and may degrade the network performance. Therefore, to support large number of connections and break through the restriction of limited frequency resource, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), which supports multiple signals to transmit on the same frequency resource, is introduced into the UUDN. However, NOMA with network densification arises a series of challenges. And the method to group APs efficiently on the same frequency to support for a given user is a critical problem. Thus, in this paper, we propose a user-centric access framework for providing efficient access service and the flexible resource management in NOMA-based UUDN. Under the proposed framework, we then investigate the access scheme that organizes multiple APs into respective AP group (APG) cooperatively to provide access service for each user, aiming at maximizing the system energy efficiency. First, considering the users' requirement and network environment, a grouping evaluation model is set up to organize APG efficiently.

To utilize the spectrum resources more thoroughly and efficiently, virtualization technologies have been proposed, which can be a means to mitigating resource granularity and increasing efficiency in heterogeneous network environments. In this paper, a traffic-oriented resource virtualization with demand-supply dynamic analysis is proposed for optimized resource allocation of heterogeneous networks with multiple types of services. On the supply side, i.e., the network side, a low-complexity matching game approach is introduced with the novel ?Match-Degree? conception, which could be defined with the Grey relational analysis. The complexity of generating preference list can be reduced by unifying various dimensions of network parameters. On the demand side, i.e., the user side, bandwidth allocation algorithm is designed to consider the comprehensive network traffic characteristics, energy consumption, and network price factors, to maximize the overall utility. Except from theoretic analysis, simulation has also been employed to compare the proposed scheme with prior and traditional ones.

It is also an intuitive way for non-professionals to learn how to play a musical instrument or sing a song. However, not all composers have willingness to share their own sheet music, especially those protected by strict copyright regulations. For amateurs or novice musicians without the capability to distinguish the chords by their own ears, it would be difficult for them to enjoy the happiness of playing other's music, or singing songs. In order to provide the beginners with an effective way to play music or sing songs without a given sheet music, we developed a sheet music generator - ?DeepSheet?, which was engineered based on deep learning techniques. Basically, the DeepSheet system is mainly composed of three distinctive components as follows: 1. voice separation of the audio song, 2. chord estimation of the background music, and 3. alignment of lyrics and music beats.

Awareness of our IS can help us discover interpersonal conflicts and guide us how to interact with others. Recently, automatic IS recognition is becoming increasingly important in the design of a dialogue system for harmonious interaction. With the goal to select appropriate responses, four IS types proposed by Berens are selected as the basis for our study. In this study, multiple views (multi-views) of the utterances during interaction, including emotions and dialogue topics, are recognized first. Inspired by the emotion profile theory, the IS profiles are then extracted using the multi-view features to better characterize the IS of the interactional utterances. Similar to the multilayer architectures in deep neural networks, a multi-layer multi-view IS profile representation method, structured layer by layer through embedding the multi-views, is proposed to better interpret intermediate representations in the feature space of the interactional utterances based on a probabilistic fusion model.

We focus on applications with real-time constraints, in which, any data unit must be completely processed within a given time duration. To handle fast data, it is common to place the stream data analytics system on top of a cloud infrastructure. Because stream properties, such as arrival rates can fluctuate unpredictably, cloud resources must be dynamically provisioned and scheduled accordingly to ensure real-time responses. It is essential, for existing systems or future developments, to possess the ability of scaling resources dynamically according to the instantaneous workload, in order to avoid wasting resources or failing in delivering the correct analytics results on time. Motivated by this, we propose DRS, a dynamic resource scaling framework for cloud-based stream data analytics systems. DRS overcomes three fundamental challenges: 1) how to model the relationship between the provisioned resources and the application performance, 2) where to best place resources, and 3) how to measure the system load with minimal overhead. In particular, DRS includes an accurate performance model based on the theory of Jackson open queueing networks and is capable of handling arbitrary operator topologies, possibly with loops, splits, and joins.

The concept of adaptive e-learning and autonomous agents were applied in this system to eliminate the traditional constraints of effective e-learning, such as the problem of different learning sensory and knowledge levels. Four approaches were used to solve this problem. First, learning style theory was used to classify the way of learning for each student. Second, the student activity (historical data) is kept in the system to analyze the next knowledge the student should learn or review. Next, the SQL query automated grader was used to judge the correctness of the student's query. This grader supports all the necessary commands in both DML and DDL.

To address the deficiency of existing solutions, we propose DPPro, a differentially private algorithm for high-dimensional data release via random projection to maximize utility while guaranteeing privacy. We theoretically prove that DPPro can generate synthetic data set with the similar squared Euclidean distance between high-dimensional vectors while achieving (?, ?)-differential privacy.

Xiong,"College of Physics and Information Engineering, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou 350116, China.","IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems",,2017,PP,99.0,1,13,"The recent advances of compressive sensing (CS) have witnessed a great potential of efficient compressive data gathering (CDG) in wireless sensor network systems (WSNSs). However, most existing work on CDG mainly focuses on multihop relaying strategies to improve the performance of data gathering. In this paper, we propose a mobile CDG scheme including a random walk-based algorithm and a kernel-based method for sparsifying sensory data from irregular deployments. The proposed scheme allows a mobile collector to harvest data by sequentially visiting a number of nodes along a random path. More importantly, toward building the gap between CS and machine learning theories, we explore a theoretical foundation for understanding the feasibility of the proposed scheme. We prove that the CS matrices, constructed from the proposed random walk algorithm combined with a kernel-based sparsity basis, satisfy the restricted isometry property. Particularly, we also show that m=O(klog (n/k)) measurements collected by a mobile collector are sufficient to recover a k-sparse signal and t=O(klog (n/k)) steps are required to collect these measurements in a network with n nodes. Finally, we also present extensive numerical results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme by evaluating the performance in terms of energy consumption and the impact of packet losses. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is able to not only significantly reduce communication cost but also combat unreliable wireless links under various packet losses compared to the state-of-the-art schemes, which provides an efficient alternative to data relaying approaches for CDG in WSNS.",2168-2216;21682216,,10.1109/TSMC.2017.2734886,China Scholarship Council; Cross-Strait Joint Fund of National Natural Science Foundation of China; Fujian Collaborative Innovation Center for Big Data Application in Governments the Technology Innovation Platform Project of Fujian Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8013710,Compressive sensing (CS);Gaussian kernel;machine learning theory;mobile data gathering;random walk;wireless sensor network systems (WSNSs),Loss measurement;Machine learning algorithms;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Routing;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks,,,,,,,,,20170821.0,,,IEEE,IEEE Early Access Articles,computer science education theory,12

Although there is a rich literature on predicting student performance when solving problems or studying for courses using data-driven approaches, predicting student performance in completing degrees (e.g., college programs) is much less studied and faces new challenges: (1) Students differ tremendously in terms of backgrounds and selected courses; (2) courses are not equally informative for making accurate predictions; and (3) students' evolving progress needs to be incorporated into the prediction. In this paper, we develop a novel machine learning method for predicting student performance in degree programs that is able to address these key challenges. The proposed method has two major features. First, a bilayered structure comprising multiple base predictors and a cascade of ensemble predictors is developed for making predictions based on students' evolving performance states. Second, a data-driven approach based on latent factor models and probabilistic matrix factorization is proposed to discover course relevance, which is important for constructing efficient base predictors.

The main idea is that not only parity checks, which are generated by an IRA encoder, but repetitions as well, are used in each user's codeword to reduce the coding and decoding complexities. Repetition is a simple way to construct a low-rate code and is shown to be beneficial for multiuser decoding iteration. With a deliberate control of the fraction of repetitions in the codeword and a degree distribution optimization of the IRA encoder, near MAC capacity performance is achieved.

We propose a novel joint compression-transmission approach, which not only minimizes the energy consumption of both compression and transmission, but also maintains the corresponding data distortion and transmission delay within a certain tolerant level. By adopting the Lyapunov framework, we develop an online algorithm to minimize the one-slot drift-plus-penalty function. We conduct numerical analysis and experimental study for our proposed approach. The results show that the size of queuing buffer has the significant impact on the energy cost. Next, we verify a fundamental tradeoff between the energy expenditure and transmission delay, and derive the theoretical performance bounds.

In some situations, the predictions given by collective members on the outcome of a future event can be modified (such as by updating or removing predictions) to reach a higher consistency level (less diversity) in a collective. The main concern of this paper is to investigate the impact of diversity on the quality of collective prediction by taking into account such modifications within a collective. Diversity is understood as the variety of individual predictions on the same problem. The simulation experiments (with different collective cardinalities and levels of diversity reduction) have revealed that such modifications are not useful in improving the quality of collective prediction. Instead, they have emphasized the important role of diversity in leading to a better collective prediction. That is the more diverse the collective, the better the collective prediction.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-5795-5; POD:978-1-5090-5796-2,10.1109/INISTA.2017.8001148,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8001148,integration computing;intelligent collective;wisdom of crowds,Collective intelligence;Computer science;Education;Forecasting;Predictive models;Simulation;Statistical analysis,decision making;forecasting theory,collective prediction quality;diversity impact;intelligent collectives,,,,,,,,3-5 July 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,computer science education theory,5

It is non-trivial to detect stress timely for proactive care. With the popularity of social media, people are used to sharing their daily activities and interacting with friends on social media platforms, making it feasible to leverage online social network data for stress detection. In this paper, we find that users stress state is closely related to that of his/her friends in social media, and we employ a large-scale dataset from real-world social platforms to systematically study the correlation of users' stress states and social interactions. We first define a set of stress-related textual, visual, and social attributes from various aspects, and then propose a novel hybrid model - a factor graph model combined with Convolutional Neural Network to leverage tweet content and social interaction information for stress detection. Experimental results show that the proposed model can improve the detection performance by 6-9 percent in F1-score. By further analyzing the social interaction data, we also discover several intriguing phenomena, i.e., the number of social structures of sparse connections (i.e., with no delta connections) of stressed users is around 14 percent higher than that of non-stressed users, indicating that the social structure of stressed users' friends tend to be less connected and less complicated than that of non-stressed users.",1041-4347;10414347,,10.1109/TKDE.2017.2686382,"NExT; National Key Research and Development Plan; 10.13039/501100000923 - Australian Research Council; 10.13039/501100000924 - MSRA; 10.13039/501100001321 - National Research Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural, and Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100004147 - Tsinghua University; ",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7885098,Stress detection;factor graph model;healthcare;micro-blog;social interaction;social media,Correlation;Medical services;Neural networks;Psychology;Stress;Twitter,graph theory;neural nets;psychology;social aspects of automation;social networking (online),convolutional neural network;factor graph model;online social network;proactive care;psychological stress;social attributes;social interactions;social media platforms;social networks;social structures;stress detection;textual attributes;tweet content;user stress state;visual attributes,,,,,,,20170322.0,Sept. 1 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,computer science education theory,13

This paper therefore presents a controlled evaluation of this effect, conducted within the framework of self-determination theory. Students were tasked with removing redundant recursion in a multiple recursive algorithm. The experimental group (N = 19) used the SRec program visualization system, while the control group (N = 17) could use any programming tool in which they were proficient, such as BlueJ or Eclipse. The increase in motivation was measured by the difference between student scores in pre- and post-tests of their motivation. Statistically significant increases were observed for the two more determined forms of motivation, intrinsic motivation (p = 0.01), and extrinsic motivation via identified regulation (p = 0.03). Student feedback about their subjective acceptance of SRec reinforced these results. These findings give experimental support to expectations for software visualization in terms of motivation.

Zhu,"Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China",IEEE Access,20170803.0,2017,5,,13455,13464,"Via processing the computation intensive applications (apps) at the network edge, mobile edge computing (MEC) becomes a promising technology to enhance the ability of the user equipments (UEs). Most existing works usually focus on whether to offload or where to offload the apps under the premise that sufficient resources are owned by the network edge. However, the demand heterogeneity of UEs and the limitation of resources are usually failed to be considered. Since the limited resources may constrain the number of accessed UEs, how the MEC service providers (SPs) choose the UEs to serve while ensuring UEs' Quality of Service (QoS) is a key issue. Under this context, in this paper, we study the matching problem between the MEC SPs and the UEs in a multi-MEC and multi-UE scenario. Within this scenario, MEC SPs are equipped with limited wireless and computational resources. Auction theory is utilized to model the matching relationship between MEC SPs and UEs as the commodity trading. With this trading, UEs can obtain MEC service from SPs, when they successfully purchase the combinational resources (including computational and wireless resources) from SPs. To complete the auction process, a multi-round-sealed sequential combinatorial auction mechanism is proposed.

AMI consists of smart electric, gas, and water meters, and the devices are very limited in terms of battery, processing power, and memory.

An efficient routing metric is needed for energy-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose an energy- and congestion-aware routing metric for smart meter networks to be deployed in smart cities. The proposed metric is an adaptive parent node selection mechanism that considers the residual energy and queue utilization of neighboring nodes.

In order to tackle the uncertainties existing in systems, interval type-2 (IT2) fuzzy approach is utilized to establish the model, wherein upper and lower membership functions together with weighting coefficients are employed to express the uncertainties.

However, due to the selfish nature, SUs may not cooperate unconditionally as most previous works have assumed. Therefore, how to stimulate SUs to play cooperatively is an important issue. In this paper, we propose a reputation-based CSS incentive framework, where the cooperation stimulation problem is modeled as an indirect reciprocity game. In the proposed game, SUs choose how to report their sensing results to the fusion center (FC) and gain reputations, based on which they can access a certain amount of vacant licensed channels in the future. For the proposed game, we derive theoretically the optimal action rule, according to which the SU will truthfully report its result when the estimated average energy is equal to or higher than the given threshold and vice versa. The decision accuracy of the FC thereby can be greatly improved. Moreover, we derive the condition under which the optimal action rule is evolutionarily stable.

In NFV, Virtual Network Functions Forwarding Graph (VNF FG) [1] is used to describe the logic connections among the VNFs placed on the Physical Network (PN). And end-to-end services are represented as flows traverse the VNF FG. To improve the reliability of the services, redundancy is proposed as an effective method. Existing redundancy method protects the unreliable VNF for end-to-end service independently and embeds the backup without considering the reliability of the PN hardware. Such a scheme ignores the global information of the VNF FG and leads to an inaccurate reliability estimation for the services. These deficiencies result in over backup and the utilization reduction of the underlying resource. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a novel redundancy scheme. By using the Cost-aware Importance Measure (CIM), the structure of the VNF FG is involved in selecting the qualified backups.

Moreover, with the consideration of users' mobility and social characteristics, we classify them into multicast and core types by studying the user stay probability and familiarity. In particular, core users can cooperate with the BS to distribute videos to the multicast users through intracluster D2D multicast. However, core users cannot selflessly help the BS to distribute videos; instead, they will evaluate their personal benefits before distributing the videos to the multicast users. Further, a Stackelberg game-based pricing mechanism is proposed to inspire the core users to distribute videos.

Nowadays, graph-based methods are widely applied to saliency detection including manifold ranking(MR) method, which is shown to be fast and effective. However, because of only using a single feature and imperfect selection strategy for background seeds, MR has a poor performance in some circumstances. In order to complete more challenging saliency detection, an improved method based on manifold ranking algorithm is proposed in this paper. The adopted parallel architecture enables the final detection results generated with the combination of calculations from background seeds and foreground seeds. These seeds are quickly obtained by using priori information and the graph structure is optimized with adding three constraints. Moreover, the graph edge weights are computed by utilizing a adaptive local width parameter and measuring multi-features distance. Three-stage strategy is used to calculate the final saliency map. Experiment results on two large famous datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs better comparing with MR and other state-of-the-art methods.",,CD:978-1-5090-4656-0; Electronic:978-1-5090-4657-7; POD:978-1-5090-4658-4,10.1109/CCDC.2017.7979048,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7979048,Background seeds;Foreground seeds;Graph edge weights;Graph structure;Manifold ranking;Parallel architecture;Saliency detection;Three-stage strategy,Aerospace electronics;Histograms;Image color analysis;Image edge detection;Kernel;Manifolds;Parallel architectures,computer vision;graph theory,background seeds;computer vision;foreground seeds;graph structure;graph-based methods;improved saliency detection;manifold ranking algorithm;parallel architecture;priori information;three-stage strategy,,,,,,,,28-30 May 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,computer science education theory,305

To deal with their emerging challenge of physical layer security, in this paper, we study the antieavesdropping problem in the presence of selfish jammers, who desire to achieve maximum profit for themselves. We consider both the single-channel multijammer (SCMJ) model and the multichannel single-jammer (MCSJ) model. We investigate the interaction between the source that transmits secret information and friendly jammer nodes who assist the source by interfering with the eavesdropper. This problem is formulated as an oligopoly market consisting of a few firms and a buyer. By modeling the problem as a Bertrand game based on price competition, we obtain the optimal pricing scheme for the friendly, while for selfish jammers, the utility of those jammers is maximized. For the SCMJ model, we prove the existence of Bertrand Equilibrium by deriving a closed-form expression for the optimal price strategy. For the MCSJ model, a closed-form expression for power allocation is derived, based on which a new algorithm is designed to obtain the optimal strategy of the jammer.

Since the increase in mobile resources, the researchers have taken the initiative to take into contemplation resource sharing among heterogeneous mobile devices. Therefore, to design a system architecture for mobility models and resource sharing are key issues that require utmost efforts to be solved to achieve anticipated objectives. Therefore, keeping in view the desired goals, in this paper, we present a system architecture based on the hierarchical resource sharing mechanism for MCC. The proposed system architecture is divided into three domains, such as Global Cloud Server (GCS), Local ISP Server (LIS), and Gateway Server (GWS). Also, the novel paradigm for minimizing the delay in the network based on deploying Foglets at each proposed algorithm of clustering mechanism is also present. Moreover, the fuzzy rule-based scheme is proposed to eliminate the inappropriate foglets before deciding an optimal foglet for handover. A foglet selection scheme is developed based on the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) decision mechanism. Various parameters such as delay, jitter, Bit Error Rate (BER), packet loss, communication cost, response time, and network load are considered for selecting an optimal network. To check the feasibility and performance of the proposed system architecture, the mobility scenario is considered with a different speed of a mobile node ranging from very high to very low. The simulation results and an analytical model are compared with existing scheme for foglet selection by a mobile node.

We discovered that teachers of primary and secondary education in our country believe that the highest retention of knowledge and understanding of mechanics can be achieved in the real world environment (in lab and outdoor) observing the natural physics phenomena and repeating the experiments that led to the physics laws. We know that this is just partially true. It is our belief that simulations using as supplement to real laboratory experiments increase students' understanding of mechanics. Physical processes are often beyond the capability of humans to observe them in schools. Teaching students we have seen that adequate understanding using lab experiments is difficult even in the simplest mechanic phenomena (ball roling on the slope). Students were unable to comprehand the full concept of the physics phenomena from the experiment unless we teach them theory first. In this article, we explain how we used simulations that allow students to adjust the experiments to their comprehantion abilities.

Gao,"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China",IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems,20170713.0,2017,28,8.0,2342,2356,"Web-scale knowledge graphs containing billions of entities are common nowadays. Querying these graphs can be modeled as a subgraph matching problem. Since knowledge graphs are incomplete and noisy in nature, it is important to discover answers matching exactly as well as answers similar to queries. Existing graph matching algorithms usually use graph indices to accelerate query processing. For billion-node graphs, it may be infeasible to build the graph indices due to the amount of work and the memory/ storage required. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for finding the best k answers for a given query without precomputing graph indices. An answer's quality is measured by a matching score that is computed online. To accelerate query processing, we propose a novel technique for bounding the matching scores during the computation. By using bounds, the low quality answers can be efficiently pruned. The bounding technique can be implemented in a distributed environment, allowing our approach to efficiently query web-scale knowledge graphs. We evaluate the effectiveness and the efficiency of our approach on real-world datasets. The result shows that our bounding technique can reduce the running time up to two orders of magnitude comparing to an approach without using bounds.",1045-9219;10459219,,10.1109/TPDS.2017.2665478,Collaborative Innovation Center of Novel Software Technology and Industrialization; Collaborative Innovation Center of Wireless Communications Technology; International S&T Cooperation Program of China; Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Network and Information Security; National Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province; 10.13039/100000001 - US National Science Foundation; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100002701 - Ministry of Education; ,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7845718,"Subgraph similarity matching;billion-node graph;distributed system;index-free;knowledge graph;top-<named-content xmlns:xlink=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"" xmlns:ali=""http://www.niso.org/schemas/ali/1.0/"" xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" content-type=""math"" xlink:type=""simple""> <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$</tex-math> <alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""jin-ieq2-2665478.gif"" xlink:type=""simple""/> </alternatives> </inline-formula> </named-content> query",Acceleration;Avatars;Films;Knowledge engineering;Optimization;Query processing;Resource description framework,Internet;graph theory;knowledge based systems;query processing,billion-node graphs;bounding technique;distributed environment;graph indices;graph matching algorithms;graph querying;matching score;query processing;querying Web-scale knowledge graphs;search space pruning;subgraph matching problem,,,,,,,20170207.0,Aug. 1 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,computer science education theory,14

Each private message is destined for a different user and the leakage rate to the other receiver must satisfy a constraint. This model captures several scenarios concerning secrecy, i.e., when both, either or neither of the private messages are secret. Inner and outer bounds on the leakage-capacity region are derived when the eavesdropper knows the codebook. The inner bound relies on a Marton-like code construction and the likelihood encoder. A uniform approximation lemma is established that states that the marginal distribution induced by the encoder on each of the bins in the Marton codebook is approximately uniform. Without leakage constraints the inner bound recovers Marton's region and the outer bound reduces to the UVW-outer bound. The bounds match for semi-deterministic (SD) and physically degraded (PD) BCs, as well as for BCs with a degraded message set. The leakage-capacity regions of the SD-BC and the BC with a degraded message set recover past results for different secrecy scenarios.

In this paper, we utilize a special case of Rothaus construction when two of these three bent functions differ by a suitably chosen characteristic function of an n/2-dimensional subspace. This simplification allows us to treat the induced bent conditions more easily, also implying the possibility to specify the initial functions in the partial spread class and most notably to identify several instances of the so-called non-normal bent functions. Affine inequivalent bent functions within this class are then identified using a suitable selection of initial bent functions within the partial spread class (stemming from the complete Desarguesian spread). It is also shown that when the initial bent functions belong to the class D, then, under certain conditions, the constructed functions provably do not belong to the completed Maiorana-McFarland class.

Through this paper, the author discusses the impact of the methods adopted as part of the experiment, on the interest of the students and their respective performance. The sample consisted of 22 postgraduate computer science students. Their responses to the instruments administered, their scores and their LMS access logs were analyzed. The author was able to achieve statistically significant results with respect to the students' interest and their performance, for mainly two strategies - integration of LMS, and teaching the topics by developing an application in multiple phases throughout the duration of the course. It was found that with regards to project work, continuous interaction with the instructor was a desired and accepted approach by the students. The study also revealed the misconceptions that an instructor may have when teaching a programming language or when using mobile devices for teaching.

But, studies show that rising student numbers lead to a high dropout rate. Thus, strengthening the study skills of the students plays a key role in reducing this dropout rate and should be a key objective of every education system. In particular, universities have the power to improve the study skills of pupils at an early stage through the designed programs and measures. With the Pupils' Academy Serious Gaming, the Department of Computer Science at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) has introduced an instrument to promote the study skills. This initiative aimed primarily at pupils of upper vocational schools (UVS). In addition to the study skills, thus the ability of more application-oriented knowledge transfer objectives and playful introduction to an important enterprise software can be achieved. This paper presents the Pupils' Academy based on the online SAP ERP Simulation Game ERPsim as an example of how the enterprise software SAP ERP is successfully applied to strengthen study skills. In addition, the pupils learn how to deal with the SAP platform and train skills like decision making, analysis, strategy development, data processing and presentation. The positive impact on study skills is evidenced with the help of a self-assessment by means of an IT-based survey carried out by the participating students.

E-learning is nowadays widely used in higher education as a mean for supporting learning on academic programs. Concurrently, the Open Educational Resources (OER) are becoming a valuable alternative to improve access to high-quality educational content released under open licenses by outstanding universities worldwide. The conjunction of both concepts can configure a strategy to improve the quality of the curricula in the higher education institutions, particularly in development countries, in order to equalize the learning outcomes of international academic programs and to reduce the cost associated with educational content development. This work aims to achieve a preliminary understanding of the potential of the OER availability to be used in E-learning environments. As a case study, we have conducted an exploration of the feasibility of using OER to supplement E-learning environments for Higher Education in Computer Science at Ecuador.

The new educational model is based on three clouds: a) the self-formation cloud which is composed of everything related to the student's education (curriculum, etc.); b) the learning paradigm cloud which is related to the paradigms, strategies, forms of assessment, and learning tools; and c) the knowledge sources cloud which is composed of all existing knowledge in the world, in all its forms, from all possible sources. To give support to the educational model, a web platform based on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is proposed in this work.

Nokia was also doing very well in a business world until clients' needs change. Are we academics really offering what the students and the labor market need and demand? We have offered the same product for decades, but we haven't realize that the client is different and is demanding another product. Sometimes, we may have the feeling that our students are beyond this world when they are connected in the internet. Some say that the new generation is not using technology in a properly way to study; however are academics using it better? We are not using the new generation's language to communicate with students and to transfer knowledge. Games and competitions is the ?language of the new generation? and it may promote a desired long-term learning experience we academics always wished. This paper describes the use of gamification as a tool to support the lectures of concurrent and distributed subjects, for undergraduate students of computer science course. In the game students should create and optimize the production line of a specific product. In the programming class, students should create and balance the same production line to beat competitors. Students have to use concepts of distributed programming and concurrency, and create strategies to organize the threads (production line) in order to be more efficient than the other competitors. The best production lines sell more and get more benefits. This paper discusses the preliminary results obtained from a survey of learning inhibits, which were applied before and after doing the course activity. The study compares the results obtained in both surveys and indicate that with the use of gamification to support class activities the learning inhibits tend to reduce at same time that transversal competences are stimulate on students.

Several prediction models have been proposed based on video-on-demand (VOD) data from YouKu, YouTube, and Twitter. However, existing prediction methods usually require a large quantity of samples and long training time, and the prediction accuracy is poor for programs that experience a high peak or sharp decrease in popularity.

This paper is motivated by the serious demands of a high-performance in-memory frequent-pattern mining strategy, with joint optimization over the mining performance and system durability. While the widely used frequent-pattern tree (FP-tree) serves as an efficient approach for frequent-pattern mining, its construction procedure often makes it unfriendly for nonvolatile memories (NVMs). In particular, the incremental construction of FP-tree could generate many unnecessary writes to the NVM and greatly degrade the energy efficiency, because NVM writes typically take more time and energy than reads. To overcome the drawbacks of FP-tree on NVMs, this paper proposes evergreen FP-tree (EvFP-tree), which includes a <italic>lazy counter</italic> and a minimum-bit-altered (MBA) <italic>encoding scheme</italic> to make FP-tree friendly for NVMs. The basic idea of the lazy counter is to greatly eliminate the redundant writes generated in FP-tree construction. On the other hand, the MBA encoding scheme is to complement existing wear-leveling techniques to evenly write each memory cell to extend the NVM lifetime. As verified by experiments, EvFP-tree greatly enhances the mining performance and system lifetime by 40.28% and 87.20% on average, respectively. And EvFP-tree reduces the energy consumption by 50.30% on average.",0278-0070;02780070,,10.1109/TCAD.2017.2681077,"Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Imaging Technology; Chongqing High-Tech Research Program; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Innovation Center for Big Data and Digital Convergence of Yuan Ze University, Taiwan.; Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100004663 - Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan; ",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7875434,Energy efficiency;FP-construct;frequent-pattern mining;frequent-pattern tree (FP-tree);lifetime;nonvolatile memories (NVMs);performance;phase-change memory (PCM),Data analysis;Data mining;Encoding;Nonvolatile memory;Phase change materials;Radiation detectors;Random access memory,,,,,,,,,20170310.0,Dec. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,computer science education strategies,13

For each class, we first model the characters of images within the same class using Gaussian mixture model (GMM). We then represent each image by calculating the Euclidean distance and relative Euclidean distance between the image and the GMM model for each class. We concatenate the representations of each class for joint representation. In this way, we can represent an image by not only considering the visual contents but also combining the class-specific characters.

Wang,"Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Clarkson University, Potsdam, NY, USA",IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid,20171019.0,2017,8,6.0,2637,2647,"This paper discusses a consensus-based alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) approach for solving the dynamic dc optimal power flow (DC-OPF) problem with demand response in a distributed manner. In smart grid, emerging techniques together with distributed nature of data and information, significantly increase the complexity of power systems operation and stimulate the needs for distributed optimization. In this paper, the distributed DC-OPF approach solves local OPF problems of individual subsystems in parallel, which are coordinated via global consensus variables (i.e., phase angles on boundary buses of adjacent subsystems). Three distributed DC-OPF algorithms are discussed with different convergence performance and/or communication requirement. All three distributed algorithms can effectively handle prevailing constraints for the transmission network, generating units, and demand response in individual subsystems, while the global convergence can be guaranteed. In particular, based on the traditional distributed ADMM approach, a fully decentralized algorithm without the central controller is proposed in Algorithm 2 with a new communication strategy, in which only limited information on boundary buses are exchanged among adjacent subsystems. In addition, the accelerated ADMM is discussed in Algorithm 3 for improving the convergence performance. In recognizing distributed OPF approaches in literature, one major research focus on this paper is to quantify the impact of key parameters and subsystem partitioning strategies on the convergence performance and the data traffic via numerical case studies.

Zhang,"School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China",IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems,20171018.0,2017,36,11.0,1869,1882,"Thermal sensor noise has a great impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of a dynamic thermal management (DTM) strategy. To address the problem of forecasting temperature based on noisy thermal sensors, we first propose a Kalman-based runtime thermal prediction scheme. To obtain accurate temperature predictions, a multivariate linear power model and a physically-based state space thermal model for 3-D network-on-chip are also proposed. Simulation results show that it reduces the standard deviations of the prediction error by 46%-53% compared with the auto-regressive based one under sensor noise with ? = 2. Conventional reactive DTM techniques suffer from significant performance degradation due to their pessimistic reaction, thus, based on the proposed prediction scheme, we further propose a proactive DTM strategy that primarily consists of a thermal-aware routing algorithm and a proactive throttling scheme: 1) to take into account both thermal and congestion issues, we propose a proactive congestion and thermal aware routing algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that it can achieve better throughput as well as approach better thermal balance.

One of these challenges is, that these protocols require election authorities to perform complex tasks like generating keys in a distributed manner and decrypting votes in a distributed and verifiable manner. Although corresponding key generation and decryption protocols exist, they are not used in real-world elections for several reasons: The few existing implementations of these protocols and their corresponding interfaces are not designed for people with non technical background and thus not suitable for use by most election authorities. In addition, it is difficult to explain the security model of the protocols, but legal provisions generally require transparency. We implemented a smartphone application for election authorities featuring distributed key generation and verifiable distributed decryption of votes. In addition, we prepared education material throughout based on formulated metaphors for election authorities in order to explain the security of the application. We evaluated the usability of the application and understanding of the underlying security model, concluding that the application is usable for non-experts in computer science.

Kifle,"IT Doctoral Program, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia",2017 IEEE AFRICON,20171107.0,2017,,,911,916,"User centered design (UCD) provides principles and activities for improving usability. However, traditional UCD methods lack considering the context of users in low income, culturally diverse settings and where Information and Communication Technology (ICT) development is at its infant stage. Software development in low and medium income countries like Ethiopia is characterized by big difference in education and livelihood. Heterogeneous cultures both between different ethnic groups and between rural and urban contexts is another challenge for Ethiopian software development. The paper addresses how to adapt UCD methods and agile development to bridge these heterogeneities. To this end, a multi-case study was implemented, researching two projects in an Ethiopian software company. An action research approach has been complemented by a survey and interviews with other companies. It has resulted in contextualization of UCD practices: personas mediated between rural and urban users and developers. Personas helped also customer representatives as well as product owners to understand users and their requirements and allowed to test releases against persona requirements before deployment. Personas were updated throughout the project based on usability testing and experience from early deployment. Besides personas local IT personnel mediated between the rural users and software developers.

These are based on 3D Multi User Virtual Environment platforms (MUVE), and although they have been used for various innovative educational projects their complex permission systems and large numbers of functions can make their management potentially challenging. It follows that an inadequately managed MULE can be ineffective with respect to intended learning outcomes. The purpose of this research was to determine how management challenges manifest themselves and how to support educators in learning and applying MULE management skills. We utilized the popular OpenSim platform for this study. First, a survey of the need for user support (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">${\mathrm{N\,= \,43}}$</tex-math><alternatives> <inline-graphic xlink:href=""allison-ieq1-2632126.gif""/></alternatives></inline-formula>) is described.

The MI-based brain computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide communication for the physically impaired. The performance of MI-based BCI mainly depends on the subject's ability to self-modulate electroencephalogram signals. Proper training can help naive subjects learn to modulate brain activity proficiently. However, training subjects typically involve abstract motor tasks and are time-consuming. Methods: to improve the performance of naive subjects during motor imagery, a novel paradigm was presented that would guide naive subjects to modulate brain activity effectively. In this new paradigm, pictures of the left or right hand were used as cues for subjects to finish the motor imagery task. Fourteen healthy subjects (11 male, aged 22-25 years, and mean 23.6?1.16) participated in this study. The task was to imagine writing a Chinese character. Specifically, subjects could imagine hand movements corresponding to the sequence of writing strokes in the Chinese character. This paradigm was meant to find an effective and familiar action for most Chinese people, to provide them with a specific, extensively practiced task and help them modulate brain activity. Results: results showed that the writing task paradigm yielded significantly better performance than the traditional arrow paradigm (p <; 0.001). Questionnaire replies indicated that most subjects thought that the new paradigm was easier. Conclusion: the proposed new motor imagery paradigm could guide subjects to help them modulate brain activity effectively.

Turn-taking temporal evolution in a dyadic conversation is inevitable and can be incorporated into a modeling framework for characterizing and recognizing the personality traits (PTs) of two speakers. This study presents an approach to automatically predicting PTs in a dyadic conversation. First, a recurrent neural network (RNN) was used to model the relationship between Big Five Inventory 10 (BFI-10) items and linguistic features of spoken text in each turn of a speaker (speaker turn) to output a BFI-10 profile. The RNN applies a recurrent property to characterize the short-term temporal evolution of a dialog. Second, the coupled hidden Markov model (C-HMM) was employed to model the long-term turn-taking temporal evolution and cross-speaker contextual information for detecting the PTs of two individuals for the entire dialog represented by the BFI-10 profile sequence. The Mandarin Conversational Dialogue Corpus was used for evaluation. The evaluation result shows that an average perception accuracy of 79.66% for the big five traits was achieved using five-fold cross validation. Compared with conventional HMM and support vector machine-based methods, the proposed approach achieved a more favorable performance according to a statistical significance test.

Implementation of academic evaluation almost always requires an integration of relevant data, which are often scattered in separate systems. Such an integration effort is often tedious and time consuming because the data must be gathered from different systems, manually integrated, and then presented in a format that meets some pre-determined academic evaluation criteria. One way to help reducing the amount of effort expended in the integration is to make the data available in a format that enables linking between any part of the data and allows various academic evaluation queries to be performed on them. Our work intends to realise this idea by using Semantic Web technologies, in particular ontology and linked data. In particular, our work is situated in a concrete use case based on the academic evaluation process as periodically conducted in Universitas Indonesia (UI). In this paper, we focus on the first step of this effort, namely the development of an ontology for academic evaluation with a particular emphasis on evaluation of undergraduate degree programs in UI. There has been a number of prior work focusing on the development of an ontology for a similar problem, yet none of them takes into account the fact that academic data evolve over time. Our ontology thus accounts for this aspect according to the UIs academic evaluation criteria.

However, because of its limited time in Java programming courses, coding rules are rarely educated. As a result, codes made by students become far from readable codes. In this paper, we propose a coding rule learning function using static code analyzers in Java Programming Learning Assistant System (JPLAS), targeting students who have accomplished the grammar learning and are going to write practical codes for final projects. Coding rules for this function consist of naming rules, coding styles, and potential problems. We evaluate the improvement of readability in four codes refined by this function and the usability of this function through the questionnaires completed by five students.

This paper presents Synteny Explorer, an interactive visualization application designed to let college students explore genome evolution of mammalian species. The tool visualizes synteny blocks: segments of homologous DNA shared between various extant species that can be traced back or reconstructed in extinct, ancestral species. We take a karyogram-based approach to create an interactive synteny visualization, leading to a more appealing and engaging design for undergraduate-level genome evolution education. For validation, we conduct three user studies: two focused studies on color and animation design choices and a larger study that performs overall system usability testing while comparing our karyogram-based designs with two more common genome mapping representations in an educational context. While existing views communicate the same information, study participants found the interactive, karyogram-based views much easier and likable to use.

Mustapha,"Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Tronoh, Malaysia",2015 International Symposium on Mathematical Sciences and Computing Research (iSMSC),20161020.0,2015,,,249,254,"Electronic collaboration can provide the environments for educators and learners to connect electronically via the Internet to study together, communicate discuss, and to exchange information and resources from anywhere, anytime and in any place. However, despite the progress registered in the use of e-collaboration system as educational tools through the incorporation of constructivism learning theories and its related didactics in higher educational institution, the approach has not yet been successfully transferred to the classroom. More importantly, there are still misconceptions among researchers regarding students achieving authentic learning from online interaction and collaboration. In an attempt to close this gap, a framework was developed to assist in the design, development and implementation of e-collaboration in a higher education institution. The framework addresses the development process of e-collaboration content, approaches for e-collaboration, pedagogical didactics, learning theories, and roles of users in e-collaboration. In an attempt to validate the framework, an e-collaboration system named `Teach, Learn, and Research E-collaboration System' (TELERECS), was developed and experimentally implemented in a classroom context. An experimental research design based on control and experimental groups, pre/post-test and usability survey were used to validate the framework. The results revealed that there is significant difference between the post-test mean scores of the experimental and control groups. In addition, there is moderate, positive monotonic correlation between easy to use and post-test-scores; and between useful for team work and post-test-score for the experimental group. These imply that the framework offers a promising basis for meaningful learning.

Software environments such as simulators are very flexible, and thus often used. On the other hand, if the target hardware is complex and large, it is very hard to finish the simulation in practical time because of software's slow simulation speed. Thus, we develop a hardware environment for efficient evaluation of computer systems. We propose and develop an IBM PC Compatible SoC on an FPGA where hardware developers can evaluate their custom architectures. The SoC has an x86 soft core processor which can run general purpose operating systems. By making the proposed system run on FPGAs of two major vendors, i.e. Xilinx and Altera, we believe that it can be widely adopted. Besides, the SoC can be used for learning computer systems, because of its open-source policy. In this paper, we detail the design and implementation of the proposed SoC, and verify that it accurately runs some applications.

To this end, we built an adaptive recommender system that consists of several tools (modules) to create a data pipeline, perform data analysis tasks and provide recommendations for professors' council regarding the adjustment of the learning curriculum. The system includes an educational component with modules for course annotation, timeline generator based on learning curriculum and students' skills analysis, and a novel professional network analysis component, with modules to parse students' and graduates' profiles and extract their skills, creating a skills' timeline and identifying the most desired skills that should be (eventually more thoroughly) covered by the curricula.

A distinctive set of communication skills is needed by people who work successfully in virtual teams, and few universities or companies provide structured education and training in virtual teamwork. At a midsized southeastern Masters Comprehensive University, professors from the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Business, and Education came together to explore how they might use cross-disciplinary student teams (groups comprised of students with different backgrounds and educational goals) to teach concepts in their own disciplines while providing students with the opportunity to become more proficient in virtual team communication. Research questions: (1) Can cross-disciplinary student team projects successfully support learning in virtual team communication as well as address the learning objectives of specific courses? (2) What can faculty learn from a cross-disciplinary teaching model that can be applied to virtual teams? Situating the case: Experiential learning is based on performing real tasks and reflecting on that process; it benefits learners by engaging them in complex, authentic situations. Virtual teams are significant because they support a great deal of the work currently taking place in our global economy; they are significant in higher education because students need to develop skills in international virtual communication before they are introduced to high-stakes work environments. In previous cases, students have collaborated across national cultures to develop project deliverables, such as websites, reports, and usability studies and present them in virtual environments using such tools as WebEx, Skype, and live streaming. How this case was studied: The findings from this case are based on individual student reflections, which were used to create a data matrix for each project, and instructor observation and evaluation. About the case: In Spr- ng 2013, six faculty from the same university worked together to incorporate virtual teams into their classrooms. These six faculty members were divided into two groups of three with each group representing three colleges mentioned earlier. The faculty developed two interdisciplinary projects (one on infographics and another on social media) that enabled rich and diverse student collaboration. In both groups, the three faculty leaders worked together to define a project scope that students could achieve and that would relate to learning goals in each discipline. Conclusions: The lessons learned from this experience are that: (1) technical challenges will occur; (2) students from all disciplines must receive the same information; (3) instructors must balance respect for their colleagues and support for their students; (4) team assignments need to be consistent and fair; (5) instructors need to establish appropriate and fair assessment measurements for their own students; and (6) projects need to be realistic in order to show the students the value of virtual work.",0361-1434;03611434,,10.1109/TPC.2015.2429973,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7108078,Cross-disciplinary;experiential learning;multiple disciplines;teaching case;virtual teams;virtual teamwork;virtual world,Computer aided instruction;Streaming media;Teamwork;Virtual groups;Virtual reality,computer aided instruction;media streaming;virtual reality,ICT;Skype;WebEx;cross-disciplinary teaching model;cross-disciplinary virtual teams;data matrix;experiential learning;global economy;infographics;international virtual communication;live streaming;southeastern Masters Comprehensive University;structured education;virtual teamwork,,3.0,,34.0,,,20150514.0,June 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,computer science usability education,21

By leveraging robots, biomimicry, and iDevices, we seek to establish an engaging and unique experience for free-choice learners visiting aquariums, zoos, museums, and other public venues. The robotic fish incorporates a three-degree-of-freedom tail along with a combined pitch and buoyancy control system, allowing for high maneuverability in an underwater three-dimensional (3-D) space. The iDevice app implements three modes of control that offer a vividly colored, intuitive, and user-friendly theme to enhance the user experience when controlling the biomimetic robotic fish. In particular, the implemented modes vary in the degree of autonomy of the robotic fish, from fully autonomous to remotely controlled. A series of tests are conducted to assess the performance of the robotic fish and the interactive control modes.

Participation in programming contests can promote student engagement. Although there are systems that support training for programming contests, they don't still promote student engagement and neither personalized and effective learning. This article aims to propose a recommendation system to support the student's performance in programming contests, with the goal of providing personalized learning.

104,170,E-participation in higher education: The importance of non-technical factors as identified in the EU-project MyUniversity,P. Mobini; H. Hansson,"Department of Computer & Systems Sciences, Stockholm University, Forum 100, SE-164 40, Kista, Sweden",2014 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE) Proceedings,20150219.0,2014,,,1,8,"Many higher education institutes and universities are involved in beyond borders decision making processes. These activities accelerated after Bologna process agreement. E-participation not only covers the general participation of citizens, but also enables higher education decision makers to communicate with each other and with all stakeholders within the university. During more than ten years the EU has funded projects in the area of e-democracy and e-participation in order to respond to this emerging requirement. The aim of some of these projects has been to equip universities with e-participation tools or platforms. There have been some EU projects that turned out to become great successes while some other projects have not been particularly useful. Lots of studies have been published about these projects and the core ideas behind them. But they have mainly covered technical aspects and less about non-technical challenges such as socio-cultural differences, rules and regulations and challenges related to unifying different decision making processes. In the present study an attempt has been made to identify the non-technical factors which have an impact for the success of e-participation in higher education. The EU-funded project MyUniversity has been selected as a case study. It involved 17 higher institutions in Europe. Data collection was conducted by means of recorded semi structured interviews with stakeholders of the MyUniversity project. Data-analysis was done using a systematic coding of audio flies using the Nvivo software and based on grounded theory principles. The emerging main categories of non-technical factors identified by interpreting data have been the major contribution of this study. The study clearly demonstrates that non-technical factors were very influential in the MyUniversity project. The following nontechnical factors were identified as crucial for the success of e-participation in higher education: 1) The socio-cultural context, 2) Id- ntification of users, 3) Usability, drivers and motivation. The study showed that deeper needs assessments locally at each university and ""cultural studies"" are very crucial and should not be neglected, even though conducting them for every single involved country or institution are both budget and time consuming. Moreover, each educational institute should use its own motivational techniques based on their cultural studies in order to involve their users. This study concludes that the ""business strategies"" used by EU for introducing e-participation projects in higher education in EU countries need to be revised taking into account the identified issues.",0190-5848;01905848,Electronic:978-1-4799-3922-0; POD:978-1-4799-3923-7; USB:978-1-4799-3921-3,10.1109/FIE.2014.7043998,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7043998,EU-project;MyUniversity;e-democracy;e-participation;higher education;non-technical factors,Communities;Decision making;Educational institutions;Europe;Interviews;Portals,computer aided instruction;cultural aspects;data analysis;decision making;further education;social sciences,Bologna process agreement;EU-project;Europe;MyUniversity;Nvivo software;data analysis;decision making;e-democracy;e-participation;grounded theory principles;higher education;non-technical factors;socio-cultural differences,,0.0,,19.0,,,,22-25 Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,computer science usability education,7

Gestalz,"School of Telecommunication Engineering, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain",2014 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE) Proceedings,20150219.0,2014,,,1,8,"Open educational resources are a key instrument in the promotion of learning and social appropriation of knowledge in the digital world. Providing access to existing learning resources in a way that teachers, students and parents are able to discover, acquire, discuss and adapt them to their own learning scenarios will also promote the development of values and attitudes that play a fundamental role in the educational process, such as team work, collaboration and critical thinking. In turn, this will foster the development of learning networks and communities. In this context, teachers play an instrumental role as facilitators, as their expertise enables them to assess the quality of content and to design and adapt learning activities according to individual learners' profiles. However, we wanted to find out how the interaction with open educational resources would enhance teachers' activities, if digital resources could be easily integrated in their actual educational curricula, or if teachers felt that the introduction of these resources would improve the educational experience of their students. This paper addresses the usage and usability of open educational resources from teachers' perceptions. For this, we utilized the Open Discovery Space portal, a socially-powered and multilingual open educational resources' repository intended to support teachers, students and parents to intuitively identify, share, reuse and revise digital learning resources. This analysis was performed taking into account both actual content and ancillary services offered by the portal (e.g., content sharing, content discussion, community building), and was methodologically organized as a streamlined cognitive walkthrough that included two evaluation workshops in late 2013 and early 2014, and a further debriefing survey in mid 2014. The first workshop included a brief course to teachers on the functionalities and aims of the Open Discovery Space portal and an assessment survey. The s- cond workshop was devoted to answer the questions posed by the teachers participating after a 6-week period of usage and reflection. Again, the workshop was completed with an assessment survey on the portal's content and services. Finally, in mid 2014 a final evaluation, survey-based session was (will be at the time of writing this abstract) carried out after continuing interaction with the portal's content and services during several months.",0190-5848;01905848,Electronic:978-1-4799-3922-0; POD:978-1-4799-3923-7; USB:978-1-4799-3921-3,10.1109/FIE.2014.7044065,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044065,e-learning;open educational resources;survey;usability,Communities;Conferences;Educational institutions;Europe;Portals;Usability,computer aided instruction;portals,assessment survey;digital learning resources;educational curricula;educational process;learning networks development;open discovery space portal;open educational resources,,0.0,,20.0,,,,22-25 Oct. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications,computer science usability education,7

Some of the proven benefits of thin clients are lower cost of ownership and very less power consumption which supports to Green Computing. The ability of thin client can be increased by reducing network latency to improve the performance and usability of thin clients. Network latency causes a great delay in transmitting a message or communication from one location to another. Many other external factors, like congestion in the network, bandwidth limitation, computer storage capacities and the distance between two locations also contribute to the delay. The proposed paper aims at the issues of Network Latency and its various aspects in a thin client network. The paper also undergoes with experimenting thin client with different environment to find network latency which helped in finding conclusion and proposing new ideology for reducing network latency.

Although strong security measures are in place for most mobile systems, the area where these systems often fail is the reliance on the user to make decisions that impact the security of a device. As our prime example, Android relies on users to understand the permissions that an app is requesting and to base the installation decision on the list of permissions. Previous research has shown that this reliance on users is ineffective, as most users do not understand or consider the permission information. We propose a solution that leverages a method to assign a risk score to each app and display a summary of that information to users. Results from four experiments are reported in which we examine the effects of introducing summary risk information and how best to convey such information to a user. Our results show that the inclusion of risk-score information has significant positive effects in the selection process and can also lead to more curiosity about security-related information.",1545-5971;15455971,,10.1109/TDSC.2013.58,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.ezproxy.rit.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6684532,Risk communication;mobile security;usability,Androids;Humanoid robots;Mobile communication;Privacy;Security;Smart phones,mobile computing;risk management;security of data;smart phones,Android Apps;device security;intrusive applications;malicious applications;mobile devices;mobile systems;risk communication;risk-score information;security measures;security-related information;summary risk information,,12.0,,36.0,,,20131216.0,May-June 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines,computer science usability education,13
