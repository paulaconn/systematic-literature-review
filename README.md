WIP: Organizes bulk search result outputs (.csv) from IEEE and ACM libraries for systematic literature reviews

## Files:
- systematic-literature-review.py: This script automates the following tasks:
1. Combines all search results for a ACM and IEEE
2. Per ACM/IEEE, selects full-text articles
3. For each keyword, chooses the top 50 relevant articles
4. Removes duplicate articles containing the same title, DOI, and ID.
5. Documents removal of articles per selection criteria (#3,4)

- searches directory: contains sample output from IEEE and ACM libraries.
- output directory: all outputs generated by systematic-literature-review.py

## Requirements:
- Python 3.5.2 with pandas and re installed.

## Outputs:
- ACM-original.csv: All search entries for ACM library with keywords annotated.
- ACM.csv: Final searches with only top relevant articles, no duplicates, and only full-text papers.
The above information is also available for IEEE data.

### Notes:
- The removal of rows with empty null variables in the number of pages column is not fully documented. This occurs in the combineCSV method after a csv file is read. 
- Future work will review the reliability of the duplicate entries removal and document each.
