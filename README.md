WIP: Organizes bulk search result outputs (.csv) from IEEE and ACM libraries for systematic literature reviews

## Files:
- systematic-literature-review.py: This script automates the following tasks:
1. Combines all search results for a ACM and IEEE
2. Per ACM/IEEE, selects full-text articles
3. Removes all duplicate results (by title and author)
4. For each keyword, chooses the top 50 relevant articles
5. Documents removal of articles per selection criteria (#2,3,4)

- searches directory: contains sample output from IEEE and ACM libraries.
- output directory: all outputs generated by systematic-literature-review.py

## Requirements:
- Python 3.5.2 with pandas and re installed.

## Outputs:
- ACM-original.csv: All search entries for ACM library with keywords annotated.
- ACM.csv: Final searches with only top relevant articles, no duplicates, and only full-text papers.
The above information is also available for IEEE data.

### Notes:
- The removal of rows with empty (null) variables in the number of pages column is not fully documented in 'df_rm_short'. This occurs in the formatSearches method.
